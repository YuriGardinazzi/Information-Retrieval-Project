In [[chronobiology]], an '''infradian rhythm''' is a rhythm with a period longer than the period of a [[circadian rhythm]], i.e. with a frequency less than one cycle in 28 hours,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Frederick M. &amp; Graeber, R. Curtis, eds.  The Rhythmic Aspects of Behavior. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. 1982, (p.462).&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[menstrual cycle|menstruation]], breeding, tidal or seasonal rhythms. In contrast, [[ultradian rhythm]]s have periods shorter than the period of a circadian rhythm. Several infradian rhythms are known to be caused by hormone stimulation or exogenous factors. For example, seasonal depression, an example of an infradian rhythm occurring once a year, can be caused by the systematic lowering of light levels during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychteacher.co.uk/biologicalrhythms/infradian_ultradian_rhythms.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan Dolfing described syntrophy as "the critical interdependency between producer and consumer".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolfing|first=Jan|date=2014-01-01|title=Syntrophy in microbial fuel cells|journal=The ISME Journal|volume=8|issue=1|pages=4–5|doi=10.1038/ismej.2013.198|issn=1751-7362|pmc=3869025|pmid=24173460}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term for nutritional interdependence is often used in microbiology to describe this symbiotic relationship between bacterial species.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Microbiology, by Prescott, Harley &amp; Klein 6th edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Henderson's Dictionary of Biology, by Eleanor Lawrence, 14th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Morris ''et al''. have described the process as "obligately mutualistic metabolism".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Brandon E.L.|last2=Henneberger|first2=Ruth|last3=Huber|first3=Harald|last4=Moissl-Eichinger|first4=Christine|date=2013|title=Microbial syntrophy: interaction for the common good|journal=FEMS Microbiol Rev|volume=37|issue=3|pages=384–406|doi=10.1111/1574-6976.12019|pmid=23480449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microbial syntrophy ==
Syntrophy plays an important role in a large number of microbial processes.

The defining feature of&amp;nbsp;[[ruminant]]s, such as cows and goats, is a stomach called a&amp;nbsp;[[rumen]].&amp;nbsp;The rumen contains billions of microbes, many of which are syntrophic. One excellent example of this syntrophy is&amp;nbsp;[[interspecies hydrogen transfer]]. Some anaerobic fermenting microbes in the rumen (and other gastrointestinal tracts) are capable of degrading organic matter to short chain fatty acids, and hydrogen.&amp;nbsp;The accumulating hydrogen inhibits the microbe's ability to continue degrading organic matter, but syntrophic hydrogen-consuming microbes allow continued growth by metabolizing the waste products.&amp;nbsp;In addition, fermentative bacteria gain maximum energy yield when protons are used as electron acceptor with concurrent [[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;production.&amp;nbsp;Hydrogen-consuming organisms include methanogens, sulfate-reducers, acetogens, and others.&amp;nbsp;Some fermentation products, such as fatty acids longer than two carbon atoms, alcohols longer than one carbon atom, and branched-chain and aromatic fatty acids, cannot directly be used in [[methanogenesis]]. In acetogenesis process, these products are oxidized to acetate and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;by obligated proton reducing bacteria in syntrophic relationship with methanogenic archaea as low H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;partial pressure is essential for acetogenic reactions to be thermodynamically favorable (ΔG &lt; 0).&amp;nbsp;(Stams et al., 2005)

The number of bacterial cells that live on or in the human body, for example throughout the alimentary canal and on the skin, is in the region of 10 times the total number of human cells in it.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/22/microbes-human-body-video_n_4536675.html Crazy Way Microbes Colonize, Control The Human Body] interview with Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt; These microbes are [[Endosymbiont|vital]], for instance for the digestive and the immune system to function.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;[http://microbiologyonline.org.uk/about-microbiology/microbes-and-the-human-body Microbes and the human body] The Microbiology Society online&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the many organisms that feed on [[faeces]] or dung. A [[cow]] diet consists mainly of grass, the [[cellulose]] of which is transformed into [[lipid]]s by [[micro-organisms]] in the cow's [[large intestine]]. These micro-organisms cannot use the lipids because of lack of [[oxygen]] in the intestine, so the cow does not take up all lipids produced. When the processed grass leaves the intestine as dung and comes into open air, many organisms, such as the [[dung beetle]], feed on it.

Yet another example is the community of micro-organisms in soil that live off leaf litter. Leaves typically last one year and are then replaced by new ones. These micro-organisms mineralize the discarded leaves and release nutrients that are taken up by the plant. Such relationships are called reciprocal syntrophy because the plant lives off the products of micro-organisms. Many&amp;nbsp;[[Symbiosis|symbiotic]]&amp;nbsp;relationships are based on syntrophy.

=== Biodegradation of pollutants ===

Syntrophic microbial food webs can play an integral role in the breakdown of organic pollutants such as oils, aromatic compounds, and amino acids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Environmental contamination with oil is of high ecological importance, but can be mediated through syntrophic degradation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Alkanes]]&amp;nbsp;are hydrocarbon chains that are the major chemical component of crude oils, and have been experimentally verified to be broken down by syntrophic microbial food webs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callaghan|first=A.

This breakdown is crucial in the processes of&amp;nbsp;[[bioremediation]]&amp;nbsp;and global carbon cycling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Syntrophic microbial communities are key players in the breakdown of&amp;nbsp;[[aromatic compounds]], which are common pollutants.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferry|first=J. G.|last2=Wolfe|first2=R. S.|date=February 1976|title=Anaerobic degradation of benzoate to methane by a microbial consortium|journal=Archives of Microbiology|volume=107|issue=1|pages=33–40|issn=0302-8933|pmid=1252087|doi=10.1007/bf00427864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation of aromatic [[Benzoic acid|benzoate]] to [[methane]] produces many intermediate compounds such as [[formate]], [[acetate]], {{CO2|link=yes}} and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The build up of these products makes benzoate degradation progressively less favourable. These intermediates can then be taken up and metabolized syntrophically by [[methanogens]] to make the whole process more thermodynamically favourable.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Studies have shown that bacterial degradation of&amp;nbsp;[[amino acids]]&amp;nbsp;can be significantly enhanced through the process of syntrophy.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zindel|first=U.|last2=Freudenberg|first2=W.|last3=Rieth|first3=M.|last4=Andreesen|first4=J.

These scavengers, like&amp;nbsp;''[[Methanospirillum]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Acetobacterium]],''&amp;nbsp;metabolize the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; waste produced during amino acid breakdown, preventing a toxic build-up.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Another way to improve amino acid breakdown is through interspecies electron transfer mediated by formate. Species like ''[[Desulfovibrio]]'' employ this method.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Metabolic mechanism==
The main motive behind a syntrophic relation between two bacterial organisms is generalized as a relationship where each participant's metabolic activity cannot independently overcome the thermodynamic pressure of the reaction under standard conditions even when a cosubstrate or nutrient is added into the environment. Therefore, the cooperation of the other participant is required to reduce the intermediate pool size.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
The ''Methanobacillus omelianskii'' culture is a classic example in demonstrating how two separate unfavourable reactions can be carried out by syntrophic interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Morris|first1= Brandon E.L.|last2 = Henneberger|first2 = Ruth|last3 = Huber|first3 = Harald|last4 = Moissl-Eichinger|first4 = Christine|date = 2013|title = Microbial syntrophy: interaction for the common good|journal = FEMS Microbiol Rev|volume = 37|issue = 3|pages = 384–406|doi = 10.1111/1574-6976.12019|pmid= 23480449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strain S and strain M.o.H of ''Methanobacillus omelianskii'' oxidize ethanol into acetate and methane by a process called [[interspecies hydrogen transfer]]. Individuals of strain S are observed as obligate anaerobic bacteria that use ethanol as an [[electron donor]], whereas organisms of strain M.o.H are [[methanogens]] that oxidize hydrogen gas to produce methane.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McInerney|first1=Michael J.|last2=Struchtemeyer|first2=Christopher G.|last3=Sieber|first3=Jessica|last4=Mouttaki|first4=Housna|last5=Stams|first5=Alfons J.

Complex organic compounds such as ethanol, propionate, butyrate, and lactate cannot be directly used as substrates for methanogenesis by methanogens. On the other hand, [[fermentation]] of these organic compounds cannot occur in fermenting microorganisms unless the hydrogen concentration is reduced to a low level by the methanogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stams|first1=Alfons J.

'''Biological constraints''' are factors which make [[population]]s resistant to [[evolution]]ary change. One proposed definition of constraint is "A property of a trait that, although possibly adaptive in the environment in which it originally evolved, acts to place limits on the production of new phenotypic variants."&lt;ref&gt;Blomberg, S. P., and T. Garland. 2002. Tempo and mode in evolution: phylogenetic inertia, adaptation and comparative methods. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 15:899–910.&lt;/ref&gt;  Constraint has played an important role in the development of such ideas as [[homology (biology)|homology]] and [[body plan]]s.

== Types of constraint==
Any aspect of an organism that has not changed over a certain period of time could be considered to provide evidence for "constraint" of some sort. To make the concept more useful, it is therefore necessary to divide it into smaller units. First, one can consider the pattern of constraint as evidenced by [[phylogenetic]] analysis and the use of [[phylogenetic comparative methods]]; this is often termed [[Phylogenetic Inertia|phylogenetic inertia]], or phylogenetic constraint. It refers to the tendency of related taxa sharing traits based on phylogeny.  Charles Darwin spoke of this concept in his 1859 book "[[On the Origin of Species]]", as being "Unity of Type" and went on to explain the phenomenon as existing because organisms do not start over from scratch, but have characteristics that are built upon already existing ones that were inherited from their ancestors; and these characteristics likely limit the amount of evolution seen in that new taxa due to these constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On The Origin of Species|last = Darwin|first = Charles|publisher =|year = 1859|isbn =|location =|pages = Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If one sees particular features of organisms that have not changed over rather long periods of time (many generations), then this could suggest some constraint on their ability to change (evolve). However, it is not clear that mere documentation of lack of change in a particular character is good evidence for constraint in the sense of the character being unable to change. For example, long-term [[stabilizing selection]] related to stable environments might cause [[Punctuated_equilibrium#Stasis|stasis]].  It has often been considered more fruitful, to consider constraint in its causal sense: what are the causes of lack of change?

===Stabilizing selection===
The most common explanation for biological constraint is that [[stabilizing selection]] acts on an organism to prevent it changing, for example, so that it can continue to function in a tightly-defined [[ecological niche|niche]]. This may be considered to be a form of external constraint, in the sense that the organism is constrained not by its makeup or genetics, but by its environment. The implication would be that if the population was in a new environment, its previously constrained features would potentially begin to evolve.

===Functional coupling and physico-chemical constraint===
Related to the idea of [[stabilizing selection]] is that of the requirement that organisms function adequately in their environment. Thus, where stabilizing selection acts because of the particular niche that is occupied, mechanical and physico-chemical constraints act in a more general manner. For example, the acceleration caused by [[gravity]] places constraints on the minimum [[bone]] [[density]] and [[Physical_strength|strength]] for an animal of a particular size. Similarly, the properties of [[water]] mean that tissues must have certain [[osmotic]] properties in order to function properly.

Functional coupling takes the idea that organisms are integrated networks of functional interactions (for example, the vertebral column of [[vertebrate]]s is involved in the muscle, nerve, and vascular systems as well as providing support and flexibility) and therefore cannot be radically altered without causing severe functional disruption. This may be viewed as one type of [[trade-off]]. As [[Rupert Riedl]] pointed out, this degree of functional constraint — or burden — generally varies according to position in the organism. Structures literally in the centre of the organism — such as the vertebral column — are often more burdened than those at the periphery, such as hair or toes.

===Lack of genetic variation and developmental integration===
This class of constraint depends on certain types of phenotype not being produced by the genotype (compare stabilizing selection, where there is no constraint on what is produced, but rather on what is naturally selected). For example, for a highly homozygous organism, the degree of observed phenotypic variability in its descendants would be lower than those of a heterozygous one. Similarly, developmental systems may be highly [[canalization (genetics)|canalised]], to prevent the generation of certain types of variation.

==Relationships of constraint classes==
Although they are separate, the types of constraints discussed are nevertheless relatable to each other. In particular, stabilizing selection, mechanical, and physical constraints might lead through time to developmental integration and canalisation. However, without any clear idea of any of these mechanisms, deducing them from mere patterns of stasis as deduced from phylogenetic patterns or the [[fossil record]] remains problematic.&lt;ref&gt;Brakefield, P. M., and J. C. Roskam. 2006. Exploring evolutionary constraints is a task for an integrative evolutionary biology. American Naturalist 168(supplement):S4-S13.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the terminology used to describe constraints has led to confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Antonovics, J., and P. H. van Tienderen. 1991.

A '''polyphenic trait''' is a trait for which multiple, discrete [[phenotype]]s can arise from a single [[genotype]] as a result of differing environmental conditions. It is therefore a special case of [[phenotypic plasticity]].

There are several types of polyphenism in animals, from having sex determined by the environment to the castes of honey bees and other social insects. Some polyphenisms are seasonal, as in some butterflies which have different patterns during the year, and some Arctic animals like the [[snowshoe hare]] and [[Arctic fox]], which are white in winter. Other animals have predator-induced or resource polyphenisms, allowing them to exploit variations in their environment. Some nematode worms can develop either into adults or into resting [[dauer larva]]e according to resource availability.

==Definition==
[[file:Termites polymorphism.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Polyphenism in [[termite]]s&lt;br /&gt;
    A : Primary king &lt;br /&gt;
    B : Primary queen &lt;br /&gt;

    D : Tertiary queen &lt;br /&gt;
    E : Soldiers &lt;br /&gt;
    F : Worker]]

A '''polyphenism''' is a biological mechanism that causes a trait to be polyphenic. For example, [[crocodile]]s possess a [[temperature-dependent sex determination|temperature-dependent sex determining polyphenism]], where sex is the trait influenced by variations in nest temperature.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1993.0059 |title=On the Effect of Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination on Sex Ratio and Survivorship in Crocodilians |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=252 |issue=1334 |pages=149–155 |year=1993 |last1=Woodward |first1=D. E |last2=Murray |first2=J. D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When polyphenic forms exist at the same time in the same [[panmictic]] (interbreeding) population they can be compared to [[polymorphism (biology)|genetic polymorphism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ford, E. B. |authorlink=E. B. Ford |date=1975 |title=Ecological genetics |edition=4th |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall |pages= }}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With polyphenism, the switch between morphs is environmental, but with genetic polymorphism the determination of morph is genetic. These two cases have in common that more than one morph is part of the population at any one time. This is rather different from cases where one morph predictably follows another during, for instance, the course of a year. In essence the latter is normal [[ontogeny]] where young forms can and do have different forms, colours and habits to adults.

The discrete nature of polyphenic traits differentiates them from traits like weight and height, which are also dependent on environmental conditions but vary continuously across a spectrum. When a polyphenism is present, an environmental cue causes the organism to develop along a separate pathway, resulting in distinct morphologies; thus, the response to the environmental cue is “all or nothing.” The nature of these environmental conditions varies greatly, and includes seasonal cues like temperature and moisture, [[pheromone|pheromonal]] cues, [[kairomone|kairomonal]] cues (signals released from one species that can be recognized by another), and nutritional cues.

==Types==

===Sex determination===
Sex-determining polyphenisms allow a species to benefit from [[sexual reproduction]] while permitting an unequal [[gender]] ratio. This can be beneficial to a species because a large female-to-male ratio maximizes reproductive capacity. However, temperature-dependent sex determination (as seen in crocodiles) limits the range in which a species can exist, and makes the species susceptible to endangerment by changes in weather pattern.&lt;ref name="Woodward" /&gt; Temperature-dependent sex determination has been proposed as an explanation for the extinction of the dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gilbert |first1=S.F. |year=2003 |title=Developmental Biology |edition=7th |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=727–737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population-dependent and reversible sex determination, found in animals such as the [[blue wrasse]] fish, have less potential for failure. In the blue wrasse, only one male is found in a given territory: [[larva]]e within the territory develop into females, and adult males will not enter the same territory. If a male dies, one of the females in his territory becomes male, replacing him.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt; While this system ensures that there will always be a mating couple when two animals of the same species are present, it could potentially decrease genetic variance in a population, for example if the females remain in a single male's territory.

===Insect castes===
[[File:Closeup on honeypot ants (Myrmecocystus mimicus) at Oakland Zoo.jpg|thumb|Insect castes: Replete and worker honeypot ants ''[[Myrmecocystus mimicus]]'']]

The caste system of insects enables [[eusociality]], the division of labor between non-breeding and breeding individuals. A series of polyphenisms determines whether larvae develop into queens, workers, and, in some cases soldiers. In the case of the [[ant]], ''P. morrisi'', an embryo must develop under certain temperature and photoperiod conditions in order to become a reproductively-active queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1071468 |pmid=12114626 |title=Evolution of the Gene Network Underlying Wing Polyphenism in Ants |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5579 |pages=249–52 |year=2002 |last1=Abouheif |first1=E. |last2=Wray |first2=G. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows for control of the mating season but, like sex determination, limits the spread of the species into certain [[climate]]s.
In bees, [[royal jelly]] provided by [[worker bee]]s causes a developing larva to become a [[queen bee|queen]]. Royal jelly is only produced when the queen is aging or has died. This system is less subject to influence by environmental conditions, yet prevents unnecessary production of queens.

===Seasonal===&lt;!-- [[Seasonal polyphenism]] redirects here --&gt;
{{further|Snow camouflage}}

Polyphenic [[biological pigment|pigmentation]] is adaptive for insect species that undergo multiple mating seasons each year. Different pigmentation patterns provide appropriate [[camouflage]] throughout the seasons, as well as alter heat retention as temperatures change.&lt;ref name="Braendle2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bies.20456 |pmid=16937342 |title=A role for genetic accommodation in evolution? |journal=BioEssays |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=868–73 |year=2006 |last1=Braendle |first1=Christian |last2=Flatt |first2=Thomas |url=http://aerg.canberra.edu.au/library/sex_general/2006_Braendle_Flatt_Genetic_Accommodation.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because insects cease growth and development after [[eclosion]], their pigment pattern is invariable in adulthood: thus, a polyphenic pigment adaptation would be less valuable for species whose adult form survives longer than one year.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

Birds and mammals are capable of continued physiological changes in adulthood, and some display reversible seasonal polyphenisms, such as in the [[Arctic fox]], which becomes all white in winter as [[snow camouflage]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

===Predator-induced===
Predator-induced polyphenisms allow the species to develop in a more reproductively-successful way in a [[predator]]'s absence, but to otherwise assume a more defensible morphology. However, this can fail if the predator evolves to stop producing the [[kairomone]] to which the prey responds. For example, the fly larvae that feed on ''Daphnia cucullata'' (a [[water flea]]) release a kairomone that ''Daphnia'' can detect. When the fly larvae are present, ''Daphnia'' grow large helmets that protect them from being eaten. However, when the predator is absent, ''Daphnia'' have smaller heads and are therefore more agile swimmers.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

===Resource===
Organisms with resource polyphenisms show alternative phenotypes that allow differential use of food or other resources. One example is the [[Spea|western spadefoot toad]], which maximizes its reproductive capacity in temporary [[desert]] ponds. While the water is at a safe level, the tadpoles develop slowly on a diet of other opportunistic pond inhabitants. However, when the water level is low and desiccation is imminent, the tadpoles develop a morphology (wide mouth, strong jaw) that permits them to cannibalize. Cannibalistic tadpoles receive better nutrition and thus metamorphose more quickly, avoiding death as the pond dries up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00442-004-1672-6 |pmid=15300488 |title=Reassessment of the environmental mechanisms controlling developmental polyphenism in spadefoot toad tadpoles |journal=Oecologia |volume=141 |issue=3 |pages=402–10 |year=2004 |last1=Storz |first1=Brian L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[invertebrates]], the nematode ''[[Pristionchus pacificus]]'' has one morph that primarily feeds on bacteria and a second morph that produces large teeth, enabling it to feed on other nematodes, including competitors for bacterial food. In this species, cues of starvation and crowding by other nematodes, as sensed by pheromones, trigger a [[hormone|hormonal]] signal that ultimately activates a developmental switch gene that specifies formation of the predatory morph.&lt;ref name="Ragsdale2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.054 |pmid=24209628 |title=A Developmental Switch Coupled to the Evolution of Plasticity Acts through a Sulfatase |journal=Cell |volume=155 |issue=4 |pages=922–33 |year=2013 |last1=Ragsdale |first1=Erik J. |last2=Müller |first2=Manuela R. |last3=Rödelsperger |first3=Christian |last4=Sommer |first4=Ralf J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Density-dependent ===
Density-dependent polyphenism allows species to show a different phenotype based on the population density in which it was reared. In [[Lepidoptera]], [[African armyworm]] larvae exhibit one of two appearances: the gregarious or solitary phase. Under crowded or "gregarious" conditions, the larvae have black bodies and yellow stripes along their bodies. However, under solitary conditions, they have green bodies with a brown stripe down their backs. The different phenotypes emerge during the third instar and remain until the last instar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1570-7458.1998.00273.x |title=The determination of larval phase coloration in the African armyworm, Spodoptera exempta and its consequences for thermoregulation and protection from UV light |journal=Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=125–33 |year=1998 |last1=Gunn |first1=A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dauer diapause in nematodes===
[[File:Third stage Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita.png|thumb|Third stage [[dauer larva]] (resting stage) of ''[[Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita]]'']]

Under conditions of stress such as crowding and high temperature, L2 larvae of some free living nematodes such as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' can switch development to the so-called [[dauer larva]] state, instead of going the normal molts into a reproductive adult. These dauer larvae are a stress-resistant, non-feeding, long-lived stage, enabling the animals to survive harsh conditions. On return to favorable conditions, the animal resumes reproductive development from L3 stage onwards.

==Evolution==
A mechanism has been proposed for the [[evolution]]ary development of polyphenisms:&lt;ref name="Braendle2006" /&gt;

#A mutation results in a novel, heritable trait.
#The trait's frequency expands in the population, creating a population on which selection can act.
#Pre-existing (background) genetic variation in other genes results in phenotypic differences in expression of the new trait.
#These phenotypic differences undergo selection; as genotypic differences narrow, the trait becomes:
##Genetically fixed (non-responsive to environmental conditions)
##Polyphenic (responsive to environmental conditions)

Evolution of novel polyphenisms through this mechanism has been demonstrated in the laboratory. Suzuki and Nijhout used an existing mutation (''black'') in a monophenic green hornworm (''[[Manduca sexta]]'') that causes a black phenotype. They found that if larvae from an existing population of ''black'' mutants were raised at 20˚C, then all the final [[instar]] larvae were black; but if the larvae were instead raised at 28˚C, the final instar larvae ranged in color from black to green. By selecting for larvae that were black if raised at 20˚C but green if raised at 28˚C, they produced a polyphenic strain after thirteen generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1118888 |pmid=16456077 |title=Evolution of a Polyphenism by Genetic Accommodation |journal=Science |volume=311 |issue=5761 |pages=650–2 |year=2006 |last1=Suzuki |first1=Y |last2=Nijhout |first2=H. F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This fits the model described above because a new mutation (black) was required to reveal pre-existing genetic variation and to permit selection. Furthermore, the production of a polyphenic strain was only possible because of background variation within the species: two alleles, one temperature-sensitive and one stable, were present for a single gene upstream of ''black'' (in the pigment production pathway) before selection occurred. The temperature-sensitive allele was not observable because at high temperatures, it caused an increase in green pigment in hornworms that were already bright green. However, introduction of the black mutant caused the temperature-dependent changes in pigment production to become obvious. The researchers could then select for larvae with the temperature-sensitive [[allele]], resulting in a polyphenism.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

'''Trace metals''' are the [[metal]]s subset of [[trace element]]s; that is, metals normally present in small but measurable amounts in [[animal]] and [[plant]] cells and tissues and that are a necessary part of [[nutrition]] and [[physiology]]. Many [[biometal (biology)|biometal]]s are trace metals. Ingestion of, or exposure to, excessive quantities can be [[toxicity|toxic]]. However, insufficient plasma or tissue levels of certain trace metals can cause [[pathology]], as is the case with iron.

Trace metals within the human body include [[iron]], [[lithium]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], [[vanadium]], [[molybdenum]], [[manganese]] and others.&lt;ref name="Zoroddu et Peana Essential Metal for humans"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zoroddu |first1=Maria Antonietta |last2=Aaseth |first2=Jan |last3=Crisponi |first3=Guido |last4=Medici |first4=Serenella |last5=Peana |first5=Massimiliano |last6=Nurchi |first6=Valeria Marina |title=The essential metals for humans: a brief overview |journal=Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry |date=June 2019 |volume=195 |page=120-129 |doi=10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2019.03.013 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0162013418306846 |ref=Zoroddu et Peana Essential Metal for humans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |others=Series editors Sigel, Astrid; Sigel, Helmut; Sigel, Roland K.O.

Trace metals are metals needed by living organisms to function properly and are depleted through the expenditure of energy by various metabolic processes of living organisms. They are replenished in animals through diet as well as environmental exposure, and in plants through the uptake of nutrients from the soil in which the plant grows. Human [[vitamin]] pills and plant [[fertilizer]]s can be a source of trace metals.

Trace metals are sometimes referred to as trace elements, although the latter includes minerals and is a broader category. See also [[Dietary mineral]]. Trace elements are required by the body for specific functions. Things such as vitamins, sports drinks, fresh fruits and vegetables are sources. Taken in excessive amounts, trace elements can cause problems. For example fluorine is required for the formation of bones and enamel on teeth. However, when taken in an excessive amount can cause a disease called "Fluorosis', in which bone deformations and yellowing of teeth are seen. Fluorine can occur naturally in some areas in ground water.

Trace metals include iron that can help to prevent anemia, and zinc that is a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in over 100 enzyme reactions.

[[File:Heterochronism of adaptation.svg|thumb|400px|'''Heterochronism of supercompensation''': Different parameters require different amounts of time to recover after strain. [[Tendon]]s and [[bone tissue]] require considerably longer to adapt than muscle tissue.]]
In [[sports science]] theory, '''supercompensation''' is the post training period during which the trained function/parameter has a higher performance capacity than it did prior to the training period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/defining-supercompensation-training|title=Defining supercompensation training|date=March 9, 2009|website=human-kinetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Supercompensation.svg|thumb|right|400px|Initial fitness, training, recovery, and supercompensation]]
The [[physical fitness|fitness]] level of a [[human]] body in training can be broken down into four periods: initial fitness, parietal fitness  [[training]], recovery, and '''supercompensation'''.  During the initial fitness period, the target of the training has a base level of fitness (shown by the first time sector in the graph). Upon entering the training period, the target's level of fitness decreases (shown by the second time sector in the graph).  After training, the body enters the recovery period during which level of fitness increases up to the initial fitness level (shown by the third time sector in the graph).  Because the human body is an adjustable [[organism]], it will feel the need to adjust itself to a higher level of fitness in anticipation of the next training session. Accordingly, the increase in fitness following a training session does not stop at the initial fitness level.  Instead the body enters a period of supercompensation during which fitness surpasses the initial fitness level (shown by the fourth time sector in the graph).  If there are no further workouts, this fitness level will slowly decline back towards the initial fitness level (shown by the last time sector in the graph). First put forth by Russian scientist [[Nikolai N. Yakovlev (1911–1992)]] in 1949-1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Early contributions of Russian stress and exercise physiologists|first=Atko|last=Viru|date=April 17, 2002|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=92|issue=4|pages=1378–1382|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00435.2001|pmid = 11896000}}&lt;/ref&gt; this theory is a basic principle of athletic training.

If the next workout takes place during the recovery period, [[overtraining]] may occur. If the next workout takes place during the supercompensation period, the body will advance to a higher level of fitness. If the next workout takes place after the supercompensation period, the body will remain at the base level.

More complex variations are possible; for instance, sometimes a few workouts are intentionally made in the recovery period to achieve greater supercompensation effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marrier|first=Bruno|last2=Robineau|first2=Julien|last3=Piscione|first3=Julien|last4=Lacome|first4=Mathieu|last5=Peeters|first5=Alexis|last6=Hausswirth|first6=Christophe|last7=Morin|first7=Jean-Benoît|last8=Meur|first8=Yann Le|date=2017-01-25|title=Supercompensation Kinetics of Physical Qualities During a Taper in Team Sport Athletes|journal=International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance|volume=12|issue=9|pages=1163–1169|doi=10.1123/ijspp.2016-0607|pmid=28121198|issn=1555-0265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The relation between supercompensation and training programs ==
At a first glance, creating effective training programs might look simple. All you need is to determine the intensity level and how long it takes you to get to the supercompensation period. Afterwards, continue training with the intensity level that was determined previously and keep the necessary intervals between workouts required for supercompensation. However, things become more complex because training affects many different bodily functions and parameters.  Each bodily function or parameter has a different recovery time, a different amount of time needed to reach peak supercompensation, a different amount of time between supercompensation peak and return to base fitness.

The aforementioned functions and parameters are basic ones. [[Muscle strength]] and mass are complex parameters. For instance, [[muscle mass]] is a function of many different simple parameters.  For example, amount of glycogen in muscles is a basic parameter that influences muscle mass.

== Use of supercompensation in practice ==
In classical [[sport science]], the yearly (sometimes multi-yearly) period is divided to micro and macro cycles, where each microcycle is responsible for the development of a specific (sometimes several) basic training function and parameter, whereas macrocycles are responsible for the development of complex parameters/functions (such as muscle strength). During each microcycle, the resting period is the same as the amount of time needed for reaching the supercompensation stage of the current training parameter/function (also during such a micro cycle there shouldn't be any negative influence on the recovery of the main function). Such a training method will work only when the developed functions/parameters are non-related. Unfortunately, for muscle strength and mass this is not the case (functions/parameters are related). Therefore, for muscle strength and mass different approaches are needed. During a training cycle the intensity and volume of training varies, waves of different functions are overlaid so that until the end of the microcycle supercompensation of the main required functions is achieved.

      <text bytes="21112" xml:space="preserve">'''Kin recognition''', also called '''kin detection''', is an organism's ability to distinguish between close genetic kin and non-kin. In [[evolutionary biology]] and [[psychology]], such an ability is presumed to have evolved for [[inbreeding avoidance]].

An additional [[adaptation|adaptive function]] sometimes posited for kin recognition is a role in [[kin selection]]. There is debate over this, since in strict theoretical terms kin recognition is not necessary for kin selection or the cooperation associated with it. Rather, [[eusociality|social behaviour]] can emerge by kin selection in the demographic conditions of 'viscous populations' with organisms interacting in their natal context, without active kin discrimination, since social participants by default typically share recent common origin. Since kin selection theory emerged, much research has been produced investigating the possible role of kin recognition mechanisms in mediating altruism. Taken as a whole, this research suggests that active powers of recognition play a negligible role in mediating social cooperation relative to less elaborate cue-based and context-based mechanisms, such as familiarity, [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] and phenotype matching.

Because cue-based 'recognition' predominates in social mammals, outcomes are non-deterministic in relation to actual genetic kinship, instead outcomes simply reliably correlate with genetic kinship in an organism's typical conditions. A well-known human example of an inbreeding avoidance mechanism is the [[Westermarck effect]], in which unrelated individuals who happen to spend their childhood in the same household find each other sexually unattractive. Similarly, due to the cue-based mechanisms that mediate social bonding and cooperation, unrelated individuals who grow up together in this way are also likely to demonstrate strong [[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship|social and emotional ties, and enduring altruism]].

==Theoretical background==
The English evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s theory of [[inclusive fitness]], and the related theory of [[kin selection]], were formalized in the 1960s and 1970s to explain the evolution of social behaviours. Hamilton's early papers, as well as giving a mathematical account of the selection pressure, discussed possible implications and behavioural manifestations. Hamilton considered potential roles of cue-based mechanisms mediating altruism versus 'positive powers' of kin discrimination:

{{quote|The selective advantage which makes behaviour conditional in the right sense on the discrimination of factors which correlate with the relationship of the individual concerned is therefore obvious. It may be, for instance, that in respect of a certain social action performed towards neighbours indiscriminately, an individual is only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of his neighbours who really were close relatives and could devote his beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to inclusive fitness would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind." (1996 [1964], 51)&lt;ref name="H1964"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=William D. |year=1964 |title=The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–52 |doi= 10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 |pmid=5875341}} Reprinted in. 1996. ''Narrow Roads of Gene Land. Vol. 1.'' Oxford: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These two possibilities, [[altruism]] mediated via 'passive situation' or via 'sophisticated discrimination', stimulated a generation of researchers to look for evidence of any 'sophisticated' kin discrimination. However, Hamilton later (1987) developed his thinking to consider that "an innate kin recognition adaptation" was unlikely to play a role in mediating altruistic behaviours:

{{quote|But once again, we do not expect anything describable as an innate kin recognition adaptation, used for social behaviour other than mating, for the reasons already given in the hypothetical case of the trees.(Hamilton 1987, 425)&lt;ref name="H1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |year=1987 |chapter=Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked |title=Kin recognition in animals |editor-first=D. J. C. |editor-last=Fletcher |editor2-first=C.

The implication that the [[inclusive fitness]] criterion can be met by mediating mechanisms of cooperative behaviour that are context and location-based has been clarified by recent work by West ''et al.'':

{{quote|In his original papers on inclusive fitness theory, Hamilton pointed out a sufficiently high relatedness to favour altruistic behaviours could accrue in two ways — kin discrimination or limited dispersal (Hamilton, 1964, 1971, 1972, 1975). There is a huge theoretical literature on the possible role of limited dispersal reviewed by Platt &amp; Bever (2009) and West et al. (2002a), as well as experimental evolution tests of these models (Diggle et al., 2007; Griffin et al., 2004; Kümmerli et al., 2009 ). However, despite this, it is still sometimes claimed that kin selection requires kin discrimination (Oates &amp; Wilson, 2001; Silk, 2002 ). Furthermore, a large number of authors appear to have implicitly or explicitly assumed that kin discrimination is the only mechanism by which altruistic behaviours can be directed towards relatives... [T]here is a huge industry of papers reinventing limited dispersal as an explanation for cooperation. The mistakes in these areas seem to stem from the incorrect assumption that kin selection or indirect fitness benefits require kin discrimination (misconception 5), despite the fact that Hamilton pointed out the potential role of limited dispersal in his earliest papers on inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton, 1964; Hamilton, 1971; Hamilton, 1972; Hamilton, 1975). (West et al. 2010, p. 243 and supplement)&lt;ref name="W2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=West |title=Sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans |journal=[[Evolution and Social Behaviour]] |volume=32 |year=2011 |issue=4 |pages=231–262 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.08.001 |display-authors=etal|citeseerx=10.1.1.188.3318 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

(2012) [[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship|''Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship: Compatibility between Cultural and Biological Approaches'']]. North Charleston: Createspace Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Leading [[inclusive fitness]] theorists such as Grafen have argued that the whole research program around kin recognition is somewhat misguided:

{{quote|Do animals really recognise kin in a way that is different from the way they recognise mates, neighbours, and other organisms and objects?’. Certainly animals use recognition systems to recognise their offspring, their siblings and their parents. But to the extent that they do so in the same way that they recognise their mates and their neighbours, I feel it is unhelpful to say they have a kin recognition system."
(Grafen 1991, 1095)&lt;ref name="G1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grafen |first=A. |year=1991 |title=Development, the Conveniently Forgotten Variable in True Kin Recognition - Reply |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1091–1092 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80649-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others have cast similar doubts over the enterprise:

{{quote|[T]he fact that animals benefit from engaging in spatially mediated behaviors is not evidence that these animals can recognize their kin, nor does it support the conclusion that spatially based differential behaviors represent a kin recognition mechanism (see also discussions by Blaustein, 1983; Waldman, 1987; Halpin 1991). In other words, from an evolutionary perspective it may well be advantageous for kin to aggregate and for individuals to behave preferentially towards nearby kin, whether or not this behaviour is the result of kin recognition per se" (Tang-Martinez 2001, 25)&lt;ref name="TM2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tang-Martinez |first=Z. |year=2001 |title=The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation |journal=[[Behavioural Processes]] |volume=53 |issue=1–2 |pages=21–40 |doi=10.1016/S0376-6357(00)00148-0 |pmid=11254989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Experimental evidence==
Kin recognition is a behavioral adaptation noted in many species but proximate level mechanisms are not well documented. Recent studies have shown that kin recognition can result from a multitude of sensory input. Jill Mateo notes that there are three components prominent in kin recognition. First, "production of unique phenotypic cues or labels". Second, "perception of these labels and the degree of correspondence of these labels with a 'recognition template'", and finally the recognition of the phenotypes should lead to "action taken by the animal as a function of the perceived similarity between its template and an encountered phenotype".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mateo |first=Jill M. |title=Kin Recognition in Ground Squirrels and Other Rodents |journal=[[Journal of Mammalogy]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |year=2003 |pages=1163–1181 |doi=10.1644/BLe-011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three components allow for several possible mechanisms of kin recognition. Sensory information gathered from visual, olfactory and auditory stimuli are the most prevalent. The [[belding ground squirrel]] kin produce similar odors in comparison to non-kin. Mateo notes that the squirrels spent longer investigating non-kin scents suggesting recognition of kin odor. It's also noted that belding's ground squirrels produce at least two scents arising from dorsal and oral secretions, giving two opportunities for kin recognition. Auditory distinctions have been noted among avian species. [[Long-tailed tit]]s (''Aegithalos caudatus'') are capable of discriminating kin and non-kin based on contact calls. Distinguishing calls are often learned from adults during the nestling period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sharp |first=Stuart P. |title=Learned kin recognition cues in a social bird |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue=7037 |year=2005 |pages=1127–1130 |doi=10.1038/nature03522 |display-authors=etal |pmid=15858573|bibcode=2005Natur.434.1127S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that the bald-faced hornet, ''[[Dolichovespula maculata]]'', can recognize nest mates by their cuticular hydrocarbon profile, which produces a distinct smell.&lt;ref&gt;Discrimination Between Natal and Non- Natal Nests by the Social Wasps Dolichovespula maculata and Polistes fuscatus. Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society. Deanna Ferguson, George J. Gamboa and Julia K. Jones. Departement of Biological Sciences, Oakland University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kin recognition in some species may also be mediated by immunogenetic similarity of the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Villinger |first=J. |last2=Waldman |first2=B. |year=2012 |title=Social discrimination by quantitative assessment of immunogenetic similarity |journal=Proc. R. Soc. B |volume=279 |issue=1746 |pages=4368–4374 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.1279 |pmid=22951741 |pmc=3479794 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion of the interaction of these social and biological kin recognition factors see Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lieberman |first=D. |last2=Tooby |first2=J. |last3=Cosmides |first3=L. |title=The architecture of human kin detection |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=445 |issue=7129 |pages=727–731 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/nature05510 |pmid=17301784 |pmc=3581061|bibcode=2007Natur.445..727L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that, as applied to humans, this nature-nurture interactionist perspective allows a synthesis&lt;ref name="SBNK" /&gt; between theories and evidence of social bonding and cooperation across the fields of evolutionary biology, psychology ([[attachment theory]]) and cultural anthropology ([[nurture kinship]]).

==In plants==
Kin recognition is an adaptive behavior observed in living beings to prevent inbreeding, and increase fitness of populations, individuals and genes. Kin recognition is the key to successful [[reciprocal altruism]], a behavior that increases reproductive success of both organisms involved. Reciprocal altruism as a product of kin recognition has been observed and studied in many animals, and more recently, [[plants]]. Due to the nature of plant reproduction and growth, plants are more likely than animals to live in close proximity to family members, and therefore stand to gain more from the ability to differentiate kin from strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waldman|first=B. |year=1988|title=The Ecology of Kin Recognition |journal= Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|volume=19 |pages=543–571 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.19.110188.002551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, botanists have been conducting studies to determine which plant species can recognize kin, and discover the responses of plants to neighboring kin. Murphy and Dudley (2009) shows that ''[[Impatiens pallida]]'' has the ability to recognize individuals closely related to them and those not related to them. The physiological response to this recognition is increasingly interesting. ''I. pallida'' responds to kin by increasing branchiness and stem elongation, to prevent shading relatives, and responds to strangers by increasing leaf to root allocation, as a form of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murphy|first1=G. |last2=Dudley|first2=S. |year=2009|title=Kin recognition: Competition and cooperation in Impatiens (Balsaminaceae) |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=96 |issue=11 |doi=10.3732/ajb.0900006 |pages=1990–1996 |pmid=21622319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Bhatt et al. (2010) show that ''Cakile edentula'', the American sea rocket, has the ability to allocate more energy to root growth, and competition, in response to growing next to a stranger, and allocates less energy to root growth when planted next to a sibling. This reduces competition between siblings and increases fitness of relatives growing next to each other, while still allowing competition between non-relative plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bhatt|first=M. |year=2010|title=Kin recognition, not competitive interactions, predicts root allocation in young Cakile edentula seedling pairs |journal=New Phytologist |volume=189 |issue=4 |pages=1135–1142 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03548.x |pmid=21118260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the mechanisms involved in kin recognition. They most likely vary between species as well as within species. A study by Bierdrzycki et al. (2010) shows that root secretions are necessary for ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' to recognize kin vs. strangers, but not necessary to recognize self vs. non-self roots. This study was performed using secretion inhibitors, which disabled the mechanism responsible for kin recognition in this species, and showed similar growth patterns to Bhatt et al., (2010) and Murphy and Dudley (2009) in control groups. The most interesting result of this study was that inhibiting root secretions did not reduce the ability of ''Arabidopsis'' to recognize their own roots, which implicates a separate mechanism for self/non-self recognition than that for kin/stranger recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bierdrzycki|first=M. |year=2010|title=Root exudates mediate kin recognition in plants |journal=Communicative &amp; Integrative Biology |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=28–35 |doi=10.4161/cib.3.1.10118 |pmc=2881236 |pmid=20539778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this mechanism in the roots responds to exudates and involves competition over resources like nitrogen and phosphorus, another mechanism has been recently proposed, which involves competition over light, in which kin recognition takes place in leaves. In their 2014 study, Crepy and Casal conducted multiple experiments on different accessions of ''A. thaliana''. These experiments showed that ''Arabidopsis'' accessions have distinct R:FR and blue light signatures, and that these signatures can be detected by photoreceptors, which allows the plant to recognize its neighbor as a relative or non-relative. Not much is known about the pathway that ''Arabidopsis'' uses to associate these light patterns with kin, however, researchers ascertained that photoreceptors phyB, cry 1, cry 2, phot1, and phot2 are involved in the process by performing a series of experiments with knock-out mutants. Researchers also concluded that the auxin-synthesis gene TAA1 is involved in the process, downstream of the photoreceptors, by performing a similar experiments using Sav3 knock-out mutants. This mechanism leads to altered leaf direction to prevent shading of related neighbors and to reduce competition for sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crepy|first=M. |year=2014|title=RoPhotoreceptor-mediated kin recognition in plants. |journal=New Phytologist |volume=205 |issue=1 |pages=329–38 |doi=10.1111/nph.13040 |pmid=25264216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inbreeding avoidance==
{{main|Inbreeding avoidance}}

When mice inbreed with close relatives in their natural habitat, there is a significant detrimental effect on progeny survival.&lt;ref name="pmid7939661"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiménez JA, Hughes KA, Alaks G, Graham L, Lacy RC |title=An experimental study of inbreeding depression in a natural habitat |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5183 |pages=271–3 |year=1994 |pmid=7939661 |doi= 10.1126/science.7939661|bibcode=1994Sci...266..271J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since inbreeding can be detrimental, it tends to be avoided by many species. In the [[house mouse]], the [[Major urinary proteins|major urinary protein]] (MUP) gene cluster provides a highly polymorphic scent signal of genetic identity that appears to underlie kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance.  Thus there are fewer matings between mice sharing MUP haplotypes than would be expected if there were random mating.&lt;ref name="pmid17997307"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sherborne AL, Thom MD, Paterson S, Jury F, Ollier WE, Stockley P, Beynon RJ, Hurst JL |title=The genetic basis of inbreeding avoidance in house mice |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=17 |issue=23 |pages=2061–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17997307 |pmc=2148465 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mechanism for avoiding inbreeding is evident when a female house mouse mates with multiple males. In such a case, there appears to be egg-driven sperm selection against sperm from related males.&lt;ref name="pmid26154782"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Firman RC, Simmons LW |title=Gametic interactions promote inbreeding avoidance in house mice |journal=Ecol. Lett. |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=937–43 |year=2015 |pmid=26154782 |doi=10.1111/ele.12471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[toad]]s, male advertisement vocalizations may serve as cues by which females recognize their kin and thus avoid inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waldman | first1 = B | last2 = Rice | first2 = JE | last3 = Honeycutt | first3 = RL | year = 1992 | title = Kin recognition and incest avoidance in toads| journal = Am. Zool. | volume = 32 | pages = 18–30 | doi = 10.1093/icb/32.1.18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dioecy|dioecious]] plants, the [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] may receive [[pollen]] from several different potential donors. As multiple [[pollen tube]]s from the different donors grow through the stigma to reach the [[Ovary (botany)|ovary]], the receiving maternal plant may carry out pollen selection favoring pollen from less related donor plants.&lt;ref name=Teixeira&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teixeira S, Foerster K, Bernasconi G |title=Evidence for inbreeding depression and post-pollination selection against inbreeding in the dioecious plant Silene latifolia |journal=Heredity (Edinb) |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=101–12 |year=2009 |pmid=18698334 |doi=10.1038/hdy.2008.86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, kin recognition at the level of the pollen tube apparently leads to post-pollination selection to avoid [[inbreeding depression]]. Also, seeds may be aborted selectively depending on donor–recipient relatedness.&lt;ref name=Teixeira /&gt;

      <text bytes="13036" xml:space="preserve">'''Biological thermodynamics''' is the quantitative study of the [[energy]] [[Transduction (biophysics)|transduction]]s that occur in or between [[living organism]]s, structures, and [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s and of the nature and function of the [[biochemistry|chemical]] processes underlying these transductions. Biological thermodynamics may address the question of whether the benefit associated with any particular [[phenotype|phenotypic]] trait is worth the energy [[investment]] it requires.

==History==
German-British medical doctor and biochemist [[Hans Adolf Krebs|Hans Krebs]]' 1957 book ''Energy Transformations in Living Matter'' (written with [[Hans Kornberg]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alberty R |author-link=Robert Alberty |title=A short history of the thermodynamics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions |journal=J Biol Chem |volume=279 |issue=27 |pages=27831–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15073189 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/279/27/27831 |doi=10.1074/jbc.X400003200}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first major publication on the thermodynamics of biochemical reactions. In addition, the appendix contained the first-ever published thermodynamic tables, written by [[Kenneth Burton]], to contain equilibrium constants and [[Gibbs free energy]] of formations for [[chemical specie]]s, able to calculate [[biochemical reaction]]s that had not yet occurred.

[[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] has been applied for explaining how biological organisms can develop from disorder. [[Ilya Prigogine]] developed methods for the thermodynamic treatment of such systems. He called these systems [[dissipative systems]], because they are formed and maintained by the dissipative processes that exchange energy between the system and its environment, and because they disappear if that exchange ceases. It may be said that they live in symbiosis with their environment. Energy transformations in biology are dependent primarily on [[photosynthesis]].  The total energy captured by photosynthesis in green plants from the solar radiation is about 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; joules of energy per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global Environmental Change in the Ocean and on Land|editor=M. Shiyomi|display-editors=etal|pages=343–358|chapter=Global Mapping of Terrestrial Primary Productivity and Light-Use Efficiency with a Process-Based Model|url=http://www.terrapub.co.jp/e-library/kawahata/pdf/343.pdf|author=Akihiko Ito|author2=Takehisa Oikawa|last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual energy captured by photosynthesis in green plants is about 4% of the total [[sunlight]] energy that reaches Earth. The energy transformations in biological communities surrounding [[hydrothermal vent]]s are exceptions; they oxidize [[sulfur]], obtaining their energy via [[chemosynthesis]] rather than photosynthesis.

== The focus of thermodynamics in biology==

The field of biological thermodynamics is focused on principles of [[chemical thermodynamics]] in [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]].  Principles covered include the [[first law of thermodynamics]], the [[second law of thermodynamics]], [[Gibbs free energy]], [[statistical thermodynamics]], [[reaction kinetics]], and on hypotheses of the origin of life.  Presently, biological thermodynamics concerns itself with the study of internal biochemical dynamics as: ATP hydrolysis, protein stability, DNA binding, membrane diffusion, enzyme kinetics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookEnzym.html|chapter=Reactions and Enzymes|author=M.J. Farabee|title=On-Line Biology Book|publisher=Estrella Mountain Community College|access-date=2006-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228002422/http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/biobk/biobookenzym.html|archive-date=2012-12-28|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other such essential energy controlled pathways. In terms of thermodynamics, the amount of energy capable of doing work during a chemical reaction is measured quantitatively by the change in the [[Gibbs free energy]]. The physical biologist [[Alfred Lotka]] attempted to unify the change in the Gibbs free energy with evolutionary theory.

=== Energy transformation in biological systems ===

The sun is the primary source of energy for living organisms. Some living organisms like plants need sunlight directly while other organisms like humans can acquire energy from the sun indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haynie|first=Donald T.|title=Biological Thermodynamics|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is however evidence that some bacteria can thrive in harsh environments like Antarctica as evidence by the blue-green algae beneath thick layers of ice in the lakes. No matter what the type of living species, all living organisms must capture, transduce, store, and use energy to live.

The relationship between the energy of the incoming sunlight and its wavelength {{math|λ}} or frequency {{math|ν}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = h\nu,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]] (6.63x10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt;Js) and ''c'' is the speed of light (2.998x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s). Plants trap this energy from the sunlight and undergo photosynthesis, effectively converting solar energy into chemical energy. To transfer the energy once again, animals will feed on plants and use the energy of digested plant materials to create biological macromolecules.

=== Thermodynamic Theory of Evolution ===
The biological evolution may be explained through a thermodynamic theory. The four laws of thermodynamics are used to frame the biological theory behind [[evolution]]. The [[first law of thermodynamics]] states that states that energy can not be created or destroyed. No life can create energy but must obtain it through its environment. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that energy can be transformed and that occurs everyday in lifeforms. As organisms take energy from their environment they can transform it into useful energy. This is the foundation of tropic dynamics.

The general example is that the open system can be defined as any ecosystem that moves toward maximizing the dispersal of energy. All things strive towards maximum [[entropy]] production, which in terms of evolution, occurs in changes in DNA to increase [[biodiversity]]. Thus, diversity can be linked to the second law of thermodynamics. Diversity can also be argued to be a diffusion process that diffuses toward a dynamic equilibrium to maximize entropy. Therefore, thermodynamics can explain the direction and rate of evolution along with the direction and rate of succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skene|first=Keith|date=July 31, 2015|title=Life’s a Gas: A Thermodynamic Theory of Biological Evolution|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/29af/6b1393d3cf3bf8a96c6af6d42b650fb5c8f7.pdf|journal=Entropy|volume=|pages=27|via=MDPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

=== First Law of Thermodynamics ===
The First Law of Thermodynamics is a statement of the conservation of energy; though it can be changed from one form to another, energy can be neither created nor destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Haynie, Donald T.|title=Biological Thermodynamics|publisher=Cambridge UP|year= 2001|isbn=9780521795494}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the first law, a principle called [[Hess's Law]] arises. Hess’s Law states that the heat absorbed or evolved in a given reaction must always be constant and independent of the manner in which the reaction takes place. Although some intermediate reactions may be endothermic and others may be exothermic, the total heat exchange is equal to the heat exchange had the process occurred directly. This principle is the basis for the [[calorimeter]], a device used to determine the amount of heat in a chemical reaction. Since all incoming energy enters the body as food and is ultimately oxidized, the total heat production may be estimated by measuring the heat produced by the oxidation of food in a calorimeter. This heat is expressed in [[kilocalorie]]s, which are the common unit of food energy found on nutrition labels.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy, Ralph W., David T. Williams, Ralph E. Worden, and Rex O. McMorris. Essentials of Biological and Medical Physics. New York: McGraw-Hill Book, 1955. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Law of Thermodynamics ===
The Second Law of Thermodynamics is concerned primarily with whether or not a given process is possible. The Second Law states that no natural process can occur unless it is accompanied by an increase in the entropy of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Haynie, Donald T. Biological Thermodynamics. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2001. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Stated differently, an isolated system will always tend to disorder. Living organisms are often mistakenly believed to defy the Second Law because they are able to increase their level of organization. To correct this misinterpretation, one must refer simply to the definition of [[thermodynamic system|systems]] and [[boundary (thermodynamic)|boundaries]]. A living organism is an open system, able to exchange both matter and energy with its environment. For example, a human being takes in food, breaks it down into its components, and then uses those to build up cells, tissues, ligaments, etc. This process increases order in the body, and thus decreases entropy. However, humans also 1) conduct heat to clothing and other objects they are in contact with, 2) generate convection due to differences in body temperature and the environment, 3) radiate heat into space, 4) consume energy-containing substances (i.e., food), and 5) eliminate waste (e.g., carbon dioxide, water, and other components of breath, urine, feces, sweat, etc.). When taking all these processes into account, the total entropy of the greater system (i.e., the human and her/his environment) increases. When the human ceases to live, none of these processes (1-5) take place, and any interruption in the processes (esp. 4 or 5) will quickly lead to morbidity and/or mortality.

=== Gibbs Free Energy ===
In biological systems, in general energy and entropy change together. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to define a state function that accounts for these changes simultaneously. This state function is the Gibbs Free Energy, ''G''.

:''G'' = ''H'' − ''TS''

where: 
* ''H'' is the [[enthalpy]] (SI unit: joule)
* ''T'' is the [[temperature]] (SI unit: [[kelvin]])
* ''S'' is the [[entropy]] (SI unit: joule per kelvin)
The change in Gibbs Free Energy can be used to determine whether a given chemical reaction can occur spontaneously. If ∆''G'' is negative, the reaction can occur [[spontaneous process|spontaneously]]. Likewise, if ∆''G'' is positive, the reaction is nonspontaneous.&lt;ref&gt;Bergethon, P. R. The Physical Basis of Biochemistry: The Foundations of Molecular Biophysics. New York: Springer, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical reactions can be “coupled” together if they share intermediates. In this case, the overall Gibbs Free Energy change is simply the sum of the ∆''G'' values for each reaction. Therefore, an unfavorable reaction (positive ∆''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) can be driven by a second, highly favorable reaction (negative ∆''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where the magnitude of ∆''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; magnitude of ∆''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). For example, the reaction of glucose with fructose to form sucrose has a ∆''G'' value of +5.5 kcal/mole. Therefore, this reaction will not occur spontaneously. The breakdown of ATP to form ADP and inorganic phosphate has a ∆''G'' value of -7.3 kcal/mole. These two reactions can be coupled together, so that glucose binds with ATP to form glucose-1-phosphate and ADP. The glucose-1-phosphate is then able to bond with fructose yielding sucrose and inorganic phosphate. The ∆''G'' value of the coupled reaction is -1.8 kcal/mole, indicating that the reaction will occur spontaneously. This principle of coupling reactions to alter the change in Gibbs Free Energy is the basic principle behind all enzymatic action in biological organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Alberts, Bruce. Essential Cell Biology. New York: Garland Science, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biological exponential growth''' is the exponential growth of biological organisms. When the resources availability is unlimited in the [[habitat]], the [[population]] of an [[organism]] living in the habitat grows in an [[Exponential growth|exponential]] or geometric fashion. Population growth in which the number of individuals increase by a constant multiple in each generation. The potential for population growth can be demonstrated in the laboratory under conditions that provide abundant resources and space. For example, a few fruit flies in a large culture jar containing an abundant food source may reproduce rapidly. One female fruit fly may lay more than 50 eggs. Reproductive adults develop in about 14 days, with approximately equal numbers of male and female offspring. For each female that began the population, 50 flies are expected 2 weeks later. Each female in the second generation produces 50 more flies after 2 more weeks, and so on. In other words, the population is experiencing exponential growth.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Miller and Stephen B. Harley zoology 4th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Slow exponential growth is when a population grows slowly yet exponential because the population has long live spans. While a rapid exponential growth refers to a population that grows ( and dies ) rapidly because the population has short life spans.

Resource availability is obviously essential for the unimpeded growth of a population. Ideally, when resources in the habitat are unlimited, each species has the ability to realise fully its innate potential to grow in number, as [[Charles Darwin]] observed while developing his theory of [[natural selection]].

If, in a hypothetical population of size ''N'', the birth rates (per capita) are represented as ''b'' and death rates (per capita) as ''d'', then the increase or decrease in ''N'' during a time period ''t'' will be:

&lt;math&gt;dN/dt=(b-d)N&lt;/math&gt;

(b-d) is called the 'intrinsic rate of natural increase' and is a very important parameter chosen for assessing the impacts of any biotic or [[Abiotic components|abiotic factor]] on population growth.

Any species growing exponentially under unlimited resource conditions can reach enormous [[Population density|population densities]] in a short time. Darwin showed how even a slow growing animal like the [[elephant]] could reach an enormous population if there were unlimited resources for its growth in its habitat.

'''High throughput cell biology''' is the use of automation equipment with classical [[cell biology]] techniques to address biological questions that are  otherwise unattainable using conventional methods. It may incorporate techniques from [[optics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]] or [[image analysis]] to permit rapid, highly parallel research into how cells function, interact with each other and how [[pathogen]]s exploit them in disease.&lt;ref&gt;Hsiao, A., &amp; Kuo, M. D. (2009). High-throughput Biology in the Postgenomic Era. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology, 20(7), S488–S496. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2009.04.040&lt;/ref&gt;

High throughput cell biology has many definitions, but is most commonly defined by the search for active compounds in natural materials like in medicinal plants. This is also known as high throughput screening (HTS) and is how most drug discoveries are made today, many cancer drugs, antibiotics, or viral antagonists have been discovered using HTS.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kalinina MA, Skvortsov DA, Rubtsova MP, Komarova ES, Dontsova OA. Cytotoxicity Test Based on Human Cells Labeled with Fluorescent Proteins: Fluorimetry, Photography, and Scanning for High-Throughput Assay. Molecular Imaging &amp; Biology. 2018;20(3):368-377. doi:10.1007/s11307-017-1152-0&lt;/ref&gt; The process of HTS also tests substances for potentially harmful chemicals that could be potential human health risks.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mezencev|first=Roman|last2=Subramaniam|first2=Ravi|date=October 2019|title=The use of evidence from high-throughput screening and transcriptomic data in human health risk assessments|journal=Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology|volume=380|pages=114706|doi=10.1016/j.taap.2019.114706|pmid=31400414}}&lt;/ref&gt; HTS generally involves hundreds of samples of cells with the model disease and hundreds of different compounds being tested from a specific source. Most often a computer is used to determine when a compound of interest has a desired or interesting effect on the cell samples.

Using this method has contributed to the discovery of the drug Sorafenib (Nexavar). Sorafenib is used as medication to treat multiple types of cancers, including rebel cell carcinoma (RCC, cancer in the kidneys), hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), and thyroid cancer. It helps stop cancer cells from reproducing by blocking the abnormal proteins present. In 1994, high throughput screening for this particular drug was completed. It was initially discovered by Bayer Pharmaceuticals in 2001. By using a RAF kinase biochemical assay, 200,000 compounds were screened from medicinal chemistry directed synthesis or combinatorial libraries to identify active molecules against activeRAF kinase. Following three trials of testing, it was found to have anti-angiogenic effects on the cancers, which stops the process of creating new blood vessels in the body.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hautier G. Finding the needle in the haystack: Materials discovery and design through computational ab initio high-throughput screening. Computational Materials Science. 2019;163:108-116. doi:10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.02.040&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yao|first=Yao|last2=Wang|first2=Tianqi|last3=Liu|first3=Yongjun|last4=Zhang|first4=Na|date=2019-12-04|title=Co-delivery of sorafenib and VEGF-siRNA via pH-sensitive liposomes for the synergistic treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma|journal=Artificial Cells, Nanomedicine, and Biotechnology|volume=47|issue=1|pages=1374–1383|doi=10.1080/21691401.2019.1596943|issn=2169-1401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another discovery made using HTS is Maraviroc. It is an HIV entry inhibitor, and slows the process and prevents HIV from being able to enter human cells.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Maraviroc. AHFS Consumer Medication Information. September 2019:1. http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=shib&amp;db=l0h&amp;AN=78170261&amp;site=eds-live. Accessed October 25, 2019&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to treat a variety of cancers as well, reducing or blocking the metastasis of cancer cells, which is when cancer cells spread to a completely different part of the body from where it started. High throughput screening for Maraviroc was completed in 1997, and finalized in 2005 by Pfizer global research and development team.

High-throughput biology serves as one facet of what has also been called "[[omics]] research" - the interface between large scale biology ([[genome]], [[proteome]], [[transcriptome]]), technology and researchers. High throughput cell biology has a definite focus on the cell, and methods accessing the cell such as imaging, gene expression [[microarrays]], or [[Genome-wide association study|genome wide screening]]. The basic idea is to take methods normally performed on their own and do a very large number of them without impacting their quality &lt;ref&gt;Taly, Valerie, Bernard T. Kelly, and Andrew D. Griffiths. "Droplets as microreactors for high‐throughput biology." ChemBioChem 8.3 (2007): 263-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

High throughput research can be defined as the automation of experiments such that large scale repetition becomes feasible. This is important because many of the questions faced by life science researchers now involve large numbers. For example, the Human Genome contains at least 21,000 genes,&lt;ref name="urlHow Many Genes Are There?"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/faq/genenumber.shtml | title = How Many Genes Are There? | date = 2008-09-19 | work = Human Genome Project Information | publisher = U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which can potentially contribute to cell function, or disease. To be able to capture an idea of how these genes interact with one another, which genes are involved in and where they are, methods that encompass from the cell to the genome are of interest.

== Use of robotics ==
Classical [[High throughput screening]] robotics are now being tied closer to cell biology, principally using technologies such as [[High-content screening]]. High throughput cell biology dictates methods that can take routine cell biology from low scale research to the speed and scale necessary to investigate complex systems, achieve high sample size, or efficiently screen through a collection.

== Use of microscopy and cytometry ==

High-content screening technology is mainly based on automated digital [[microscopy]] and flow [[cytometry]], in combination with IT-systems for the analysis and storage of the data.
"High-content" or visual biology technology has two purposes, first to acquire spatially or temporally resolved information on an event and second to automatically quantify it. Spatially resolved instruments are typically automated [[microscopes]], and temporal resolution still requires some form of fluorescence measurement in most cases.This means that a lot of HCS instruments are ([[fluorescence]]) microscopes that are connected to some form of image analysis package. These take care of all the steps in taking fluorescent images of cells and provide rapid, automated and unbiased assessment of experiments.

== Development of technology ==

The technology can be defined as being at the same development point as the first automated [[DNA sequencer]]s in the early 1990s. Automated [[DNA sequencing]] was a [[disruptive technology]] when it became practical and -even if early devices had shortcomings- it enabled genome scale sequencing projects and created the field of bioinformatics. The impact of a similarly disruptive and powerful technology on molecular cell biology and translational research is hard to predict but what is clear is that it will cause a profound change in the way cell biologists research and medicines are discovered.

      <text bytes="14917" xml:space="preserve">'''Potassium spatial buffering''' is a mechanism for the regulation of extracellular [[potassium]] concentration by [[astrocyte]]s. Other mechanisms for astrocytic potassium clearance are carrier-operated or channel-operated potassium chloride uptake.&lt;ref&gt;Walz W (2000): Role of astrocytes in the clearance of excess extracellular potassium. Neurochemistry International&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[repolarization]] of [[neuron]]s tends to raise potassium concentration in the extracellular fluid.  If a significant rise occurs, it will interfere with neuronal signaling by depolarizing neurons. Astrocytes have large numbers of potassium ion channels facilitating removal of potassium ions from the extracellular fluid. They are taken up at one region of the astrocyte and then distributed throughout the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell, and further to its neighbors via [[gap junction]]s. This keeps extracellular potassium at levels that prevent interference with normal propagation of an [[action potential]].

==Potassium spatial buffering==
Glial cells, once believed to have a passive role in CNS, are active regulators of numerous functions in the brain, including clearance of the neurotransmitter from the synapses, guidance during neuronal migration, control of neuronal synaptic transmission, and maintaining ideal ionic environment for active communications between neurons in central nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;Kozoriz, M. G., D. C. Bates, et al. (2006). "Passing potassium with and without gap junctions." Journal of Neuroscience 26(31): 8023-8024.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurons are surrounded by extracellular fluid rich in sodium ions and poor in potassium ions. The concentrations of these ions are reversed inside the cells. Due to the difference in concentration, there is a chemical gradient across the cell membrane, which leads to sodium influx and potassium efflux. When the action potential takes place, a considerable change in extracellular potassium concentration occurs due to the limited volume of the CNS extracellular space. The change in potassium concentration in the extracellular space impacts a variety of neuronal processes, such as maintenance of membrane potential, activation and inactivation of voltage gated channels, synaptic transmission, and electrogenic transport of neurotransmitter. Change of extracellular potassium concentration of from 3mM can affect neural activity. Therefore, there are diverse cellular mechanisms for tight control of potassium ions, the most widely accepted mechanisms being K+ spatial buffering mechanism. Orkand and his colleagues who first theorized spatial buffering stated “if a Glial cell becomes depolarized by K+ that has accumulated in the clefts, the resulting current carries K+ inward in the high [K+] region and out again, through electrically coupled Glial cells in low [K+] regions” 
In the model presented by Orkand and his colleagues, glial cells intake and traverse potassium ions from region of high concentrations to region of low concentration maintaining potassium concentration to be low in extracellular space. Glial cells are well suited for transportation of potassium ions since it has unusually high permeability to potassium ions and traverse long distance by its elongated shape or by being coupled to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, K. C. and C. Nicholson (2000). "Spatial buffering of potassium ions in brain extracellular space." Biophysical Journal 78(6): 2776-2797.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xiong, Z. Q. and F. L. Stringer (2000). "Sodium pump activity, not glial spatial buffering, clears potassium after epileptiform activity induced in the dentate gyrus." Journal of Neurophysiology 83(3): 1443-1451.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potassium regulatory mechanisms===
Potassium buffering can be broadly categorized into two categories: Potassium uptake and Potassium spatial buffering. For potassium uptake, excess potassium ions are temporarily taken into glial cells through transporters, or potassium channels. In order to preserve electroneutrality, potassium influxes into glial cells are accompanied by influx of chlorine or efflux of sodium. It is expected that when potassium accumulates within glial cells, water influx and swelling occurs. For potassium spatial buffering, functionally coupled glial cells with high potassium permeability transfer potassium ions from regions of elevated potassium concentration to regions of lower potassium concentration. The potassium current is driven by the difference in glial syncytium membrane potential and local potassium equilibrium potential. When one region of potassium concentration increases, there is a net driving force causing potassium to flow into the glial cells. The entry of potassium causes a local depolarization that propagates electrotonically through the glial cell network which causes net driving force of potassium out of the glial cells. This process causes dispersion of local potassium with little net gain of potassium ions within the glial cells, which in turn prevents swelling. Glial cell depolarization caused by neuronal activity releases potassium onto blood stream, which was once widely hypothesized to be cause of vessel relaxation, was found to have little effect on neurovascular coupling.&lt;ref&gt;Metea, M. R., P. Kofuji, et al. (2007). "Neurovascular coupling is not mediated by potassium siphoning from glial cells." Journal of Neuroscience 27(10): 2468-2471.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the efficiency of potassium spatial buffering mechanisms, in certain regions of CNS, potassium buffering seems more dependent on active uptake mechanisms rather than spatial buffering. Therefore, the exact role of glial potassium spatial buffering in the various regions of our brain still remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Kofuji, P. and E. A. Newman (2004). "Potassium buffering in the central nervous system." Neuroscience 129(4): 1045-1056. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kir channel===
The high permeability of glial cell membranes to potassium ions is a result of expression of high densities of potassium-selective channels with high open-probability at [[resting potential| resting membrane potentials]]. Kir channels, [[inward-rectifier potassium ion channel| potassium inward-rectifying channels]], allow passage of potassium ions inward much more readily than outward. They also display a variable conductance that positively correlates with extracellular potassium concentration: the higher the potassium concentration outside the cell, the higher the conductance. 

Kir channels are categorized into seven major subfamilies, Kir1 to Kir7, with a variety of gating mechanisms. Kir3 and Kir6 are primarily activated by intracellular [[G-protein]]s. Because they have a relatively low open-probability compared to the other families, they have little impact on potassium buffering. Kir1 and Kir7 are mainly expressed in [[epithelial cell]]s, such as those in kidney, choroid plexus, or retinal pigment epithelium, and have no impact on spatial buffering. Kir2, however, are expressed in brain neurons and glial cells. Kir4 and Kir5 are, along with Kir2, located in [[Muller glia]] and play important roles in potassium siphoning. There are some discrepancies among studies on expression of these channels in the stated locations.&lt;ref&gt;Kofuji, P. and N. C. Connors (2003). "Molecular substrates of potassium spatial buffering in glial cells." Molecular Neurobiology 28(2): 195-208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solessio, E., K. Rapp, et al. (2001). "Spermine mediates inward rectification in potassium channels of turtle retinal Muller cells." Journal of Neurophysiology 85(4): 1357-1367.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panglial syncytium===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Panglial Syncytium.jpg|thumbnail|right]] --&gt;
The panglial syncytium is a large network of interconnected glial cells, which are extensively linked by gap junctions. The panglial syncytium spreads through central nervous system where it provides metabolic and osmotic support, as well as ionic regulation of myelinated axons in white matter tracts. The three types of macroglial cells within network of panglial syncytium are [[astrocytes]], [[oligodendrocytes]], and ependymocytes. Originally it was believed that there was homologous gap junction between oligodendrocytes. It was later found through untrastructural analysis that gap junctions do not directly link adjacent oligodendrocytes, rather it gap junctions with adjacent astrocytes, providing secondary pathway to nearby oligodendrocytes. With direct gap junction between myelin sheaths to surrounding astrocytes, excess potassium and osmotic water directly enters astrocyte syncytium, where it downstream to astrocyte endfeet at capillaries and the [[glia limitans]].

==Potassium siphoning==

Potassium spatial buffering that occurs in the retina is called potassium siphoning, where the [[Muller cell]] is the principal glial cell type. Muller cells have important role in retinal physiology. It maintains retinal cell metabolism and are critical in maintaining potassium homeostasis in extracellular space during neuronal activity. Like cells responsible for spatial buffering, Muller cells are distinctively permeable to potassium ions through Kir channels. Like other glial cells, the high selectivity of Muller cell membranes to potassium ions is due to the high density of Kir channels. Potassium conductance is unevenly distributed in Muller cells.&lt;ref&gt;Brew, H. and D. Attwell (1985). "Is the Potassium Channel Distribution in Glial-Cells Optimal for Spatial Buffering of Potassium." Biophysical Journal 48(5): 843-847.&lt;/ref&gt; By focally increasing potassium ions along amphibian Muller cells and recording the resulting depolarization, the observed potassium conductance was concentrated in the endfoot process of 94% of the total potassium conductance localized to the small subcellular domain. The observation lead to hypothesis that excess potassium in extracellular space is “siphoned” by the Muller cells to the vitreous humor. Potassium siphoning is a specialized form of spatial buffering mechanisms where large reservoir of potassium ions is emptied into vitreous humor. Similar distribution pattern of Kir channels could be found in amphibians.&lt;ref&gt;Karwoski, C. J., H. K. Lu, et al. (1989). "Spatial Buffering of Light-Evoked Potassium Increases by Retinal Muller (Glial) Cells." Science 244(4904): 578-580.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, E. A., D. A. Frambach, et al. (1984). "Control of Extracellular Potassium Levels by Retinal Glial-Cell K+ Siphoning." Science 225(4667): 1174-1175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winter, M., W. Eberhardt, et al. (2000). "Failure of potassium siphoning by Muller cells: A new hypothesis of perfluorocarbon liquid-induced retinopathy." Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science 41(1): 256-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Existence of potassium siphoning was first reported in 1966 study by Orkand et al. In the study, optic nerve of [[Necturus]] was dissected to document the long-distance movement of potassium after the nerve stimulation. Following the low frequency stimulation of .5&amp;nbsp;Hz at the retinal end of the dissected optic nerve, depolarization 1-2mV was measured at astrocytes at the opposite end of the nerve bundle, which was up to several millimeters from the electrode. With higher frequency stimulation, higher plateau of depolarization was observed. Therefore, they hypothesized that the potassium released to extracellular compartment during axonal activity entered and depolarized nearby astrocytes, where it was transported away by unfamiliar mechanism, which caused depolarization on astrocytes distant from site of stimulation. The proposed model was actually inappropriate since at the time neither gap junctions nor syncytium among glial cells were known, and optic nerve of Necturus are unmyelinated, which means that potassium efflux occurred directly into the periaxonal extracellular space, where potassium ions in extracellular space would be directly absorbed into the abundant astrocytes around axons.&lt;ref&gt;Kofuji, P. and E. A. Newman (2004). "Potassium buffering in the central nervous system." Neuroscience 129(4): 1045-1056.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diseases==
In patients with [[Tuberous Sclerosis Complex]] (TSC), abnormalities occur in astrocyte, which leads to pathogenesis of neurological dysfunction in this disease. TSC is a multisystem genetic disease with mutation in either [[TSC1]] or [[TSC2]] gene. It results in disabling neurological symptoms such as mental retardation, autism, and seizures. Glial cells have important physiological roles of regulating neuronal excitability and preventing epilepsy. Astrocytes maintain homeostasis of excitatory substances, such as extracellular potassium, by immediate uptake through specific [[potassium channels]] and sodium potassium pumps. It is also regulated by potassium spatial buffering via astrocyte networks where astrocytes are coupled through gap junctions. Mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 gene often results in decreased expression of the astrocytic connexin protein, [[Cx43]].&lt;ref&gt;Xu, L., L. H. Zeng, et al. (2009). "Impaired astrocytic gap junction coupling and potassium buffering in a mouse model of tuberous sclerosis complex." Neurobiology of Disease 34(2): 291-299.&lt;/ref&gt; With impairment in gap junction coupling between astrocytes, myriad of abnormalities in potassium buffering occurs which results in increased extracellular potassium concentration and may predispose to neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures. According to a study done on animal model, connexin43-deficient mice showed decreased threshold for the generation of epileptiform events. The study also demonstrated role of gap junction in accelerating potassium clearance, limiting potassium accumulation during neuronal firing, and relocating potassium concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, A., R. Kohling, et al. (2006). "The impact of astrocytic gap junctional coupling on potassium buffering in the hippocampus." Journal of Neuroscience 26(20): 5438-5447.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demyelinating Diseases of the central nervous system, such as Neuromyelitis Optica, often leads to molecular components of the panglial syncytium being compromised, which leads to blocking of potassium spatial buffering. Without mechanism of potassium buffering, potassium induced osmotic swelling of myelin occurs where myelins are destroyed and axonal salutatory conduction ceases.&lt;ref&gt;Rash, J. E. (2010). "Molecular Disruptions of the Panglial Syncytium Block Potassium Siphoning and Axonal Saltatory Conduction: Pertinence to Neuromyelitis Optica and Other Demyelinating Diseases of the Central Nervous System." Neuroscience 168(4): 982-1008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radioactivity''' is generally used in life sciences for highly sensitive and direct measurements of biological phenomena, and for visualizing the location of [[biomolecule]]s [[radiolabelled]] with a [[radioisotope]].

All atoms exist as stable or unstable [[isotope]]s and the latter decay at a given [[half-life]] ranging from attoseconds to billions of years; radioisotopes useful to biological and experimental systems have half-lives ranging from minutes to months.  In the case of the hydrogen isotope [[tritium]] (half-life = 12.3 years) and [[carbon-14]] (half-life = 5,730 years), these isotopes derive their importance from all organic life containing hydrogen and carbon and therefore can be used to study countless living processes, reactions, and phenomena.  Most short lived isotopes are produced in [[cyclotron]]s, linear [[particle accelerator]]s, or [[nuclear reactor]]s and their relatively short half-lives give them high maximum theoretical specific activities which is useful for detection in biological systems.

[[File:PET-MIPS-anim.gif|thumb|Whole-body PET scan using &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG showing intestinal tumors and non-specific accumulation in bladder]]  
[[Isotopic labeling|Radiolabeling]] is a technique used to track the passage of a molecule that incorporates a radioisotope through a reaction, metabolic pathway, cell, tissue, organism, or biological system. The reactant is 'labeled' by replacing specific atoms by their isotope.  Replacing an atom with its own radioisotope is an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] label that does not alter the structure of the molecule.  Alternatively, molecules can be radiolabeled by chemical reactions that introduce an atom, [[Moiety (chemistry)|moiety]], or [[functional group]] that contains a [[radionuclide]].  For example, radio-iodination of peptides and proteins with [[Isotopes of iodine#Radioiodines I-123.2C I-124.2C I-125.2C and I-131 in medicine and biology|biologically useful iodine isotopes]] is easily done by an oxidation reaction that replaces the hydroxyl group with iodine on [[tyrosine]] and [[histadine]] residues.  Another example is to use chelators such [[DOTA (chelator)|DOTA]] that can be chemically coupled to a protein; the chelator in turn traps radiometals thus radiolabeling the protein.  This has been used for introducing Yttrium-90 onto a monoclonal antibody for therapeutic purposes and for introducing Gallium-68 onto the peptide [[Octreotide]] for diagnostic imaging by [[Positron emission tomography|PET imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Breeman | first1 = W.

Radiolabeling is not necessary for some applications.  For some purposes,  soluble ionic salts can be used directly without further modification (e.g., [[gallium-67]], [[gallium-68]], and [[radioiodine]] isotopes).  These uses rely on the chemical and biological properties of the radioisotope itself, to localize it within the organism or biological system.

[[Molecular imaging]] is the biomedical field that employs radiotracers to visualize and quantify biological processes using [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) imaging.  Again, a key feature of using radioactivity in life science applications is that it is a quantitative technique, so PET/SPECT not only reveals where a radiolabelled molecule is but how much is there.

[[Radiobiology]] (also known as radiation biology) is a field of clinical and basic medical sciences that involves the study of the action of radioactivity on biological systems.  The controlled action of deleterious radioactivity on living systems is the basis of [[radiation therapy]].

==Examples of biologically useful radionuclei==
===Hydrogen===
[[Tritium]] (Hydrogen-3) is a very low [[Beta decay|beta]] energy emitter that can be used to label [[protein]]s, [[nucleic acid]]s, drugs and almost any organic biomolecule. The maximum theoretical specific activity of tritium is 28.8 [[Curie|Ci]]/[[Mole (unit)|mmol]] (1.066 PBq/mol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voges|first1=Rolf|last2=Heys|first2=J. Richard|last3=Moenius|first3=Thomas|title=Preparation of compounds labeled with tritium and carbon-14|date=2009|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, U.K.|isbn=978-0-470-51607-2|page=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VgcIEhrwCIC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is often more than one tritium atom per molecule: for example, tritiated [[Uridine triphosphate|UTP]] is sold by most suppliers with carbons 5 and 6 each bonded to a tritium atom.

For tritium detection, liquid [[scintillation counter]]s have been classically employed, in which the energy of a tritium decay is transferred to a [[Scintillator|scintillant]] molecule in solution which in turn gives off photons whose intensity and spectrum can be measured by a [[photomultiplier]] array.  The efficiency of this process is 4–50%, depending on the scintillation cocktail used. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakonić|first1=I|last2=Nikolov|first2=J|display-authors=etal|title=Study on quench effects in liquid scintillation counting during tritium measurements|journal=Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry|date=2014|volume=302|issue=1|pages=253–259|doi=10.1007/s10967-014-3191-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scintillation Cocktails &amp; Consumables - For every liquid scintillation counting application|url=https://www.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/BRO_ScintillationCocktailsAndConsumables.pdf|website=PerkinElmer|accessdate=11 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327093930/https://www.perkinelmer.com/lab-solutions/resources/docs/BRO_ScintillationCocktailsAndConsumables.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The measurements are typically expressed in [[counts per minute]] (CPM) or disintegrations per minute (DPM).  Alternatively, a solid-state, tritium-specific [[Photostimulated luminescence|phosphor screen]] can be used together with a phosphorimager to measure and simultaneously image the radiotracer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Storage Phosphor Screen BAS-IP|url=https://www.gelifesciences.com/gehcls_images/GELS/Related%20Content/Files/1351177681492/litdoc29026296_20161015084341.pdf|website=GE Life Sciences|accessdate=11 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911190807/https://www.gelifesciences.com/gehcls_images/GELS/Related%20Content/Files/1351177681492/litdoc29026296_20161015084341.pdf|archivedate=11 September 2017|date=2012|quote=Data file 29-0262-96 AA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements/images are digital in nature and can be expressed in intensity or densitometry units within a [[region of interest]] (ROI).

===Carbon===
[[Carbon-14]] has a long half-life of 5,730±40 years. Its maximum specific activity is 0.0624 Ci/mmol (2.31 TBq/mol). It is used in applications such as [[radiometric dating]] or drug tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.aptochem.com/t-radiolabeled-test-articles.aspx | title=Radiolabeled Test Articles | accessdate= | publisher=AptoChem }}&lt;/ref&gt;  C-14 labeling is common in drug development to do [[ADME]] (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) studies in animal models and in human toxicology and clinical trials.  Since tritium exchange may occur in some radiolabeled compounds, this does not happen with C-14 and may thus be preferred.

===Sodium===
[[Sodium-22]] and [[chlorine-36]] are commonly used to study [[ion transporter]]s. However, sodium-22 is hard to screen off and chlorine-36, with a half-life of 300,000 years, has low activity.&lt;ref&gt;''Biochemic methods. Sample for medicine Students''. 2nd ed 2008, by Birgitte Lüttge. Aarhus University.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sulfur===
[[Sulfur-35]] is used to label proteins and nucleic acids. [[Cysteine]] is an [[amino acid]] containing a [[thiol group]] which can be labeled by S-35. For [[nucleotide]]s that do not contain a sulfur group, the oxygen on one of the phosphate groups can be substituted with a sulfur. This [[thiophosphate]] acts the same as a normal phosphate group, although there is a slight bias against it by most [[polymerase]]s. The maximum theoretical specific activity is 1,494 Ci/mmol (55.28 PBq/mol).

===Phosphorus===
[[Phosphorus-33]] is used to label nucleotides. It is less energetic than P-32 and does not require protection with plexi glass. A disadvantage is its higher cost compared to P-32, as most of the bombarded P-31 will have acquired only one [[neutron]], while only some will have acquired two or more. Its maximum specific activity is 5,118 Ci/mmol (189.4 PBq/mol).

[[Phosphorus-32]] is widely used for labeling nucleic acids and phosphoproteins. It has the highest emission energy (1.7 MeV) of all common research radioisotopes. This is a major advantage in experiments for which sensitivity is a primary consideration, such as titrations of very strong interactions (i.e., very low dissociation constant), footprinting experiments, and detection of low-abundance phosphorylated species. 32P is also relatively inexpensive. Because of its high energy, however, its safe use requires a number of [[engineering controls]] (e.g., [[acrylic glass]]) and [[administrative controls]].  The half-life of 32P is 14.2 days, and its maximum specific activity is 9131 Ci/mmol.

===Iodine===
[[Iodine-125]] is commonly used for labeling proteins, usually at tyrosine residues. Unbound iodine is volatile and must be handled in a fume hood.  Its maximum specific activity is 2,176 Ci/mmol (80.51 PBq/mol).

A good example of the difference in energy of the various radionuclei is the detection window ranges used to detect them, which are generally proportional to the energy of the emission, but vary from machine to machine: in a Perkin elmer TriLux Beta scintillation counter &lt;!-- Googled to see where the hell did the values come from)--&gt;, the H-3 energy range window is between channel 5–360; C-14, S-35 and P-33 are in the window of 361–660; and P-32 is in the window of 661–1024.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Detection==
[[File:Autoradiography_of_a_brain_slice_from_an_embryonal_rat_-_PMID19190758_PLoS_0004371.png|thumb|Autoradiograph of a coronal brain tissue slice, with a radiolabeled GAD67 probe.  Most intense signal is seen in subventricular zone.]]
[[File:Southern-Blot-Autoradiogramm.jpg|thumb|Autoradiograph of Southern blot membrane]]

===Quantitative===
In [[liquid scintillation counting]], a small aliquot, filter or swab is added to scintillation fluid and the plate or vial is placed in a [[scintillation counter]] to measure the radioactive emissions.  Manufacturers have incorporated solid scintillants into multi-well plates to eliminate the need for scintillation fluid and make this into a high-throughput technique.

A [[gamma counter]] is similar in format to scintillation counting but it detects gamma emissions directly and does not require a scintillant.

A [[Geiger counter]] is a quick and rough approximation of activity. Lower energy emitters such as tritium can not be detected.

===Qualitative AND Quantitative===
[[Autoradiography]]: A tissue section affixed to a microscope slide or a membrane such as a [[Northern blot]] or a hybridized [[slot blot]] can be placed against x-ray film or phosphor screens to acquire a photographic or digital image.  The density of exposure, if calibrated, can supply exacting quantitative information.

[[Phosphor storage screen]]: The slide or membrane is placed against a phosphor screen which is then scanned in a [[phosphorimager]]. This is many times faster than film/emulsion techniques and outputs data in a digital form, thus it has largely replaced film/emulsion techniques.

===Microscopy===
[[Electron microscopy]]: The sample is not exposed to a beam of electrons but detectors picks up the expelled electrons from the radionuclei.

Micro-autoradiography: A tissue section, typically cryosectioned, is placed against a phosphor screen as above.

Quantitative Whole Body Autoradiography (QWBA):  Larger than micro-autoradiography, whole animals, typically rodents, can be analyzed for biodistribution studies.

==Scientific methods==

[[Schild regression]] is a radioligand binding assay. It is used for DNA labelling (5' and 3'), leaving the nucleic acids intact.

==Radioactivity concentration==
A vial of radiolabel has a "total activity". Taking as an example γ32P [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], from the catalogues of the two major suppliers, Perkin Elmer NEG502H500UC or GE AA0068-500UCI, in this case, the total activity is 500 μCi (other typical numbers are 250 μCi or 1 mCi). This is contained in a certain volume, depending on the radioactive concentration, such as 5 to 10 mCi/mL (185 to 370 TBq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;); typical volumes include 50 or 25 μL.

Not all molecules in the solution have a P-32 on the last (i.e., gamma) phosphate: the "specific activity" gives the radioactivity concentration and depends on the radionuclei's half-life. If every molecule were labelled, the maximum theoretical specific activity is obtained that for P-32 is 9131 Ci/mmol. Due to pre-calibration and efficiency issues this number is never seen on a label; the values often found are 800, 3000 and 6000 Ci/mmol. With this number it is possible to calculate the total chemical concentration and the hot-to-cold ratio.

"Calibration date" is the date in which the vial’s activity is the same as on the label. "Pre-calibration" is when the activity is calibrated in a future date to compensate for the decay occurred during shipping.

==Comparison with fluorescence==
{{See also|Fluorescence in the life sciences}}
Prior to the widespread use of [[Fluorescence in the life sciences|fluorescence]] in the past three decades radioactivity was the most common label.

The primary advantage of fluorescence over radiotracers is that it does not require radiological controls and their associated expenses and safety measures.  The decay of radioisotopes may limit the [[shelf life]] of a reagent, requiring its replacement and thus increasing expenses.  Several fluorescent molecules can be used simultaneously (given that they do not overlap, cf. FRET), whereas with radioactivity two [[isotopes]] can be used ([[tritium]] and a low energy isotope, e.g. [[Phosphorus-33|&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;P]] due to different intensities) but require special equipment (a tritium screen and a regular phosphor-imaging screen, a specific dual channel detector, e.g.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20090105194225/http://www.biospacelab.com/html/microimager.html]).

Fluorescence is not necessary easier or more convenient to use because fluorescence requires specialized equipment of its own and because [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching]] makes absolute and/or reproducible quantification difficult.

The primary disadvantage of fluorescence versus radiotracers is a significant biological problem:  chemically tagging a molecule with a fluorescent dye radically changes the structure of the molecule, which in turn can radically change the way that molecule interacts with other molecules.  In contrast, intrinsic radiolabeling of a molecule can be done without altering its structure in any way.  For example, substituting a H-3 for a hydrogen atom or C-14 for a carbon atom does not change the conformation, structure, or any other property of the molecule, it's just switching forms of the same atom.  Thus an intrinsically radiolabeled molecule is identical to its unlabeled counterpart.

Measurement of biological phenomena by radiotracers is always direct.  In contrast, many life science fluorescence applications are indirect, consisting of a fluorescent dye increasing, decreasing, or shifting in wavelength emission upon binding to the molecule of interest.

==Safety==
If good [[health physics]] controls are maintained in a laboratory where radionuclides are used, it is unlikely that the overall radiation dose received by workers will be of much significance. Nevertheless, the effects of low doses are mostly unknown so many regulations exist to avoid unnecessary risks, such as skin or internal exposure. Due to the low penetration power and many variables involved it is hard to convert a radioactive concentration to a dose.
1 μCi of P-32 on a square centimetre of skin (through a dead layer of a thickness of 70 μm) gives 7961 [[Rad (unit)|rads]] (79.61 [[gray (unit)|grays]]) per hour . Similarly a [[mammogram]] gives an exposure of 300 [[Röntgen equivalent man|mrem]] (3 [[millisievert|mSv]]) on a larger volume (in the US, the average annual dose is 620 mrem or 6.2 mSv&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=NCRP|volume=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; ).

      <text bytes="27998" xml:space="preserve">'''Gender typing''' is the process by which a child becomes aware of their [[gender]] and thus behaves accordingly by adopting values and attributes of members of the sex that they identify as their own.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, D. R. (2009). Social and personality development (6th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt; This process is important for a child's social and personality development because it largely impacts the child's understanding of expected social behavior and influences social judgments.

==Gender identity==
Once aware of ones gender identity, the child will start to behave in gender roles normally adopted by their same-sex models. Therefore, these individual responses become internalized and function according to the appropriate gender-role standards.&lt;ref&gt;Pentony, C.G. (1980). Gender, sex typing, and gender identity. 941–942.&lt;/ref&gt; The responses that individuals receive from their social group will mold their identity – becoming more feminine or masculine – and thus affect the way they view the world. Other facets of the process can also result in atypical development. Albeit, whether a child develops shared traits, cross-gender identities, or [[androgyny]], their decision begins with the identification of a gender and the models he or she chooses to emulate. The behaviors they adopt will ultimately shape their knowledge and identity for who they are and how they should behave.

==Theories==

===Freud’s [[psychoanalytic theory]]===
[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that children go through stages of [[psychosexual development]]. In the third year of the child's life, genitals are thought to become active. As children develop a greater understanding of their own sex they also develop either a [[castration complex]] (in boys) or [[penis envy]] (in girls). For boys, during the “phallic” stage, they are at the height of childhood sexuality. During this the [[Oedipus complex]] occurs, where the boy feels erotic love for his mother ([[Electra complex]] in girls where love is directed towards the father). As time progresses and the boy matures, he is slowly able to let go of the rival feelings he has towards his father and free himself from his love for his parents. At this time, the boy learns to emulate masculine attributes from his father and subsequently to identify with him.&lt;ref name="Mullahy"&gt;Mullahy. P. (1948). ''Oedipus myth and complex: A Review of Psychoanalytic Theory''. New York, NY: Grove Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The girl's development, Freud argued, is more complicated. Generally, as with males, the first object of interest is also the mother figure and for the first four years and beyond a girl remains attached to her mother. However, when the female child learns about “[[castration]]” it sparks disappointment and she blames her mother for her lack of a penis. Because of this, the girl gives up masturbation and in turn shifts focus from her mother to her father. By abandoning [[masturbation]] the girl can no longer be active, thus displaying a passive nature. The father then assists her by smoothly transitioning her towards a more feminine path. Furthermore, the girl's affection towards her father will also influence her to emulate her mother's feminine qualities and eventually adopt more gender-typed behaviors.&lt;ref name="Mullahy"/&gt;

===Kohlberg’s cognitive-developmental theory===
The cognitive-developmental theory is also closely linked to [[Jean Piaget]]’s analysis for the age-related cognitive changes a child goes through. [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] suggested that cognition comes before action and behavior (“I am a boy so I do boy-like things”). This emphasizes the importance of a child's understanding about [[gender roles]] and their permanent placement in it. After a child can fully grasp this concept, gender-specific information will become more relevant. This idea of gender consistency, similar to Piaget's concrete-operational stage, is represented by three stages:
# gender identity: the child recognizes that they are either a boy or a girl and possesses the ability to label others.
# gender stability: the identity in which they recognizes themselves as does not change
# gender consistency: the acceptance that gender does not change regardless of changes in gender-typed appearance, activities, and traits.

When the child is able to fully grasp gender stable understanding about themselves, usually between the ages of five and seven, the motivation to master their orientation and to socialize themselves allows them to seek out same-sexed models to learn more about gender-stereotypic behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, C. L., Ruble, D. N., &amp; Szkrykablo, J. (2002). Cognitive theories of early gender development. American psychological association. 4(23), 544–557.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bussey, K. (2011). Gender identity development. ''Handbook of Identity Theory and Research.'' 603-628.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender schema theory===
A [[schema (psychology)|schema]] is a cognitively organized network of associations that is readily available to help guide an individual's perception. Gender schema acts as a guide or standard for consistent behavior in a given scenario. Labels such as “girls are weak and boys are strong,” classifies what stereotypically acceptable actions for the gender groups are. Therefore, the theory proposes the idea that once the child has developed basic knowledge on gender behaviors they will begin to construct gender schemas. This is acquired first through the basic understanding of gender-specific roles. In other words, the child learns the contents of the society, things that are related to their own and the opposite sex, and incorporates it into their gender schemas. The child then learns to apply the appropriate attributes respectively to the right gender by selectively using this knowledge to conceptualize their own actions. Hence, categorizing how they should perform in various situations by molding their capabilities to match the schematic labels.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. L. (1981) Gender schema theory: a cognitive account of sex typing. ''Psychological Review.''88(4), 354–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social-learning theory ([[Albert Bandura]])===
Social learning theorists, like Albert Bandura, suggest that adults not only provide models for children to imitate, but that they also are actively involved in influencing a child's gender-role identification. The [[Social learning theory]] proposes that gender-identities and gender-role preferences are acquired through two concepts.

# Direct tuition (differential reinforcement): The first concept is represented through direct tuition, also known as differential reinforcement. Early in a child's development, parents are already encouraging gender-appropriate activities and discouraging cross-gender activities. Adults reward children when they display gender-appropriate behavior and punish children when they display cross-gender behavior. The idea of direct tuition expresses that gender-typed behavior begins with the child adopting views they learn from their parents. Therefore, parents reinforce the developmental of gender stereotypes by providing gender-appropriate toys and activities. Adults influence a child's gender identification when they encourage gender-typed behaviors like teaching “boys how to be boys and girls how to be girls”.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. R. 2009"&gt;Shaffer, D. R. (2009). ''Social and Personality Development (6th ed.)''. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Observational learning]]: The second concept is represented through observational learning in where children imitate and follow the behaviors of individuals who are of the same sex. Children become increasingly aware of gender stereotypes in preschool and acknowledge these “same-sex models” when they begin to exercise their preferences for “gender-typed” toys or activities. These same-sex models may include any individual from teachers and older siblings to media personalities.&lt;ref name="Shaffer, D. R. 2009"/&gt;

==Social models==
There are many opportunities for a child to learn and develop their own understanding of what “[[gender]]” is. Thus as children progresses from childhood into [[adolescence]] they will already have been exposed to many factors that will influence their ideas and attitudes for normative social behaviors regarding gender roles. Social models, such as parents, siblings, and the media become extremely important during different stages of the child's development.

'''Parents:'''
Parents play a vital part in a child's early life, for they are the first group of people that a child meets and learns from. The information that surrounds a child at home becomes reinforcements for desired behaviors of a male or female. Studies have shown that as immediate as 24 hours after a child is born most parents have already engaged in gender [[Stereotype|stereotypic]] expectations of sons or daughters. Through examples such as painting a room pink or blue, encouragement to participate in shared sex-typed activities, offering gender differentiated toys, or treating the opposite sex child differently, these parent-child interactions have long lasting influence on how a child connects to certain gender-specific behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, S. D. (1997). Parental influence on children’s socialization to gender roles. ''Adolescence.'' 32(126). 253-259.&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, various evidence suggest that certain household differences affecting how a child is raised can influence how similar (or different) a child is to the opposite sex, therefore how “feminine” or “masculine” the child can potentially become. For instance, as certain research demonstrates, in the absence of a father figure boys are generally more “feminine” than those living with a father. This demonstrates the significance of father-son modeling. The same research reveals that boyhood femininity is more strongly correlated with parental reinforcement such as a father or mother's desire for a girl and/or their approval for feminine behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, C. W., Green, R. &amp; Williams, K., Goodman, M. (1987). Boyhood gender identity development: a statistical contrast of two family groups. ''Developmental Psychlology.'' 23(4), 544-557.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Siblings:'''
Apart from parents, children also seek reinforcement from their older siblings. Therefore, inconsistencies for gender behaviors can also be as a result of children emulating their siblings of opposite sex.
Sibling's influence is often most effective when the sibling is of an age that is more advanced than the child himself, therefore increasing the motivation for the child to model after their brother or sister. The impact of older siblings are power predictors for the younger sibling's gender role attitudes, sex-typed personality qualities, and masculine leisure activities. Findings suggest that girls develop less traditional attitudes than boys, thus, relative to stereotypically traditional development, older male siblings are more conscientious towards masculine activities, which are evidently modeled after by younger siblings more than feminine activities.&lt;ref name="McHale, S. M. 2001"&gt;McHale, S. M., Updegraff, K. A., Helms-Erikson, H. (2001). Sibling influences on gender development in middle childhood and early adolescence: a longitudinal study. ''Developmental Psychology.'' 37(1). 115-125.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, older brothers tend to have stronger influence over a younger sibling's sexual development. There is evidence that the relationship between older brother and younger sister can, in fact, influence the sister to become more feminine, abiding to more stereotypical gender-typed development than girls with older sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Kornreich, J. L., Hearn, K. D., Rodrigues, G. &amp; O’Sullivan, L. F. (2003). Sibling influence, gender roles, and the sexual socialization of urban early adolescent girls. ''The Journal of Sex Research.'' 40(1). 101-110.&lt;/ref&gt; Biological studies show that dizygotic twins with the opposite- sex co-twin gender show more sex-typed behaviors than same-sex twins.&lt;ref&gt;Mehta, C. M., Strough, J. (2010). Gender segregation and gender-typing in adolescence. ''Sex Role.''&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversely, this can also develop in an opposite direction in which children may try to diverge themselves from their siblings as much as possible, making their differences more salient; however, this may be more evident in first-borns possibly due to the birth order.&lt;ref name="McHale, S. M. 2001"/&gt;

'''Peers:'''
At a young age, children can already utilize their knowledge of different social categories to form stereotypes about what they understand about men and women. Interaction with peer groups will often shape people's behavior to fit normative expectations. Children often group together with other children of the same-gender. Belonging in a group that shares the same gender identity will often endorse more gender appropriate traits. An example of this is the fact that girls have more expressive traits than boys.&lt;ref&gt;Van Beijsterveldt, C. E. M., Hudziak, J. J., Boomsama, D. I. (2006). Genetic and environmental influences on cross-gender behavior to problems: a study of dutch twins at ages 7 and 10 years. ''Arch Sex. Behav.'' 648-658.&lt;/ref&gt; Research also show that children often engage in play with same-sex peers, and exclude others who are different from the norm. For example, children who want to join a group will only be allowed to engage in play if they are a same-gender peer who has had prior experience with the activity, or an opposite-gender peer who has not had prior experience.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, C. L. (1989). Children’s use of gender-related information in making social judgment. ''Developmental Psychology.'' 25(1), 80-88.&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to engage in play can influence a child to behave like to their peers. In later life, as children starts to move away from their parents, the role of friendship becomes much more influential.

'''Media:'''
Children learn about different gender categories by observing various forms of [[media (communication)|media]]. They often look for gender roles, with whom they can relate to, from books and television. Conversely, these sources of media will also stereotypically shape a child's understanding for gender acceptable behaviors. Studies examining the effects of gender stereotyping in children's literature describe that, most often than not, gender views are affiliated with stereotypes which are both culturally and individually constructed. In children's literature, male characters appear to be more central as well as less emotional and stronger. Female characters on the other hand worked out their feelings through expression, they are more dependent and usually adopt the roles of more domesticated characters.&lt;ref&gt;Turner-Bowker, D. M. (1996). Gender stereotyped descriptors in children’s picture books: does “curious Jane” exist in the literature? ''Sex Roles.'' 35(7/8), 461-488.&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, these characteristics are also seen in [[television]] programing. For example, in most prime-time television shows women receive twice as many comments about her appearance than men. Similarly, a study investigating the cartoon “[[Pokémon]]” and gender role expresses the differences in “good” and “bad” characters. Jesse and James (villains of the story) are portrayed to have adopted counter-stereotypical portrayal. While Jesse is seen as more aggressive and James as more feminine, it subtly teaches children that nontraditional or nonstereotypical gender role behaviors are bad. Furthermore, children in the story have difficulty recalling a male Pokémon revealing that there is an imbalance in which prominence is given to male characters.&lt;ref&gt;Ogletree, S. M., Martinez, C. N., Turner, T. R., Mason, B. (2004). Pokémon: exploring the role of gender. ''Sex Roles.'' 50(11/12), 851-859.&lt;/ref&gt;
These depictions of male and female character roles can potentially become unconsciously influential in the way a child constructs gender views.

==Atypical gender development and controversies==
It is expected for children to develop gender-typed behavioural cues given that children often use gender-related information to make judgments. Society often rewards shared traditional behaviours, especially for men, and thus having progressed to a cross-gender development can lead to unwanted criticisms and punishment. Therefore, when children undergo atypical gender development, due to both genetic and environmental contributors, it can drastically alter normal development from a person's sense of self-worth, self-esteem, to feelings of acceptance. When the child identifies as the opposite sex, he or she is then diagnosed with [[gender dysphoria]] (often termed ''gender identity disorder'' or GID).&lt;ref&gt;nafo, A., Iervolino, A. C., Plomin, R. (2005). Masculine girls and feminine boys: genetic and environmental contributions to atypical gender development in early childhood. ''Journal of Personality and Psychology.'' 88(2), 400-412.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genetics vs. environmental contributors:'''
The development of gender roles has been associated with both [[genetics|genetic]] and [[social]] factors.
Current biological research has suggested that [[testosterone]] differences can affect sexual orientation, gender identity, and personality. For example, girls with increased prenatal testosterone levels, due to [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH), show more male-typed behaviors than the average female. This may cause a decrease in [[empathy]] levels, which is proven to be higher in the average women than men, and an increase in physical aggression, typically higher in men than women.&lt;ref&gt;Hines, M. (2011). Gender development and the human brain. ''Annual Review of Neuroscience''.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, multiple twin studies have also shown that [[homosexual]] traits displayed greater congruence in [[Monozygotic twins|monozygotic (MZ) twins]] than [[Dizygotic twins|dizygotic (DZ) twins]] displaying genetic contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Knafo, A., Iervolino, A. C., Plomin, R. (2005). Masculine girls and feminine boys: genetic and environmental contributions to atypical gender development in early childhood. ''Journal of Personality and Psychology.'' 88(2), 400-412.&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies reveal that this is especially true for girls' gender-typed values.&lt;ref name="Knafo, A. 2011"&gt;Knafo, A., Spinath, F. M. (2011). Genetic and environmental influences on girl’s and boy’s gender-typed and gender-neutral values. ''Developmental Psychology''. 47(3), 726-731.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other studies have summarized that the prevalence of cross-gender behavior a highly heritable trait where MZ twins display the same cross-gender behaviors more so than DZ twins.&lt;ref name="Moller, B. 2009"&gt;Moller, B., Schreier, H., Li, A., Romer, G. (2009). Gender identity disorder in children and adolescents. ''Curr probl Pediatr Adolesc Health Care''. 117–143.&lt;/ref&gt;
While atypical gender role development may be heritable, this does not mean that it is independent. However, environmental effects can differ largely for different genders. Because society is more accepting of male traits (girls playing soccer) than female traits (boys doing ballet),{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} society's negativity typically forces males to try to stay within the stereotypic norms. That being said however, male influence accounted by environmental factors that lead to atypical development is also stronger for boys than girls in terms of atypical development.&lt;ref name="Knafo, A. 2011"/&gt;

'''Gender dysphoria:'''
[[Gender dysphoria]] or gender identity disorder (GID) occurs when the child identifies himself or herself as the opposite sex. GID, previously known as [[transsexualism]], occurs when a person has a strong desire to be the opposite sex because they feel uncomfortable in their own body. This may lead to cross-dressing or the desire to rid of their physical characteristic. GID is accompanied with a distress that the individual cannot change their sex and a strong rejection for sex-typical behaviors. Onset of most of these behaviors occurs as early as two to four years of age.&lt;ref name="Moller, B. 2009"/&gt; While the onset of these behaviors may occur as early as two years of age, most children that exhibit GID before puberty will not experience it once they become an  adult and will instead most likely fall under the category of gay, lesbian, or bisexual.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Jameson|first=J.

The ICD-10 is in the process of revision by the WHO, but instead of not addressing GOD in children, it will most likely be changed from "gender identity disorder of children" into "gender incongruence of childhood"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

'''Controversies about gender in [[DSM-5]]:'''
For the fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]), there has been a tremendous amount{{Clarify|date=April 2013}} of debate around whether the sexual and gender identity, which includes the GID, qualifies as a [[mental disorder]]. One of the most notable discussions for this occurred in 2003 during the annual APA meeting, where Darryl B. Hill, Ph.D., argued that the GID should not be considered a mental disorder. He explains that due to the limited amount of reliable and valid evidence, given the role of parents and therapies, for whether GID meets the conditions as a mental disorder among children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Kamens, S.R. (2011). On the proposed sexual and gender identity diagnoses for DSM-5: history and controversies. ''The Humanistic Psychologist.'' 37–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, other researchers have stated that the diagnosis does not give recognition to the individual's discomfort with their biological sex which is completely detached from their gender assignment. This leaves patients susceptible to social changes for what acceptably feminine or masculine. Lastly, it does not provide evidence for nonconformity to traditional gender behaviours which varies between cultures, life stages, genders, and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, K., Carroll, K., Denboske, K. Gender identity disorder – concerns and controversies. (2010). ''Handbook of Gender Research in Psychology''. 111-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Androgyny]]:'''
Recent studies have shown that androgynous people are able to enhance performance cross-situationally because they can alter their behaviors appropriately to becoming more “masculine” or “feminine” in the given context. According to a study, a person's activity preference in games and interests are purely based on their gender-typed stereotypes, making the person significantly more stereotyped than androgynous people. In a self-esteem test, when individuals were given opposite-sex activities, gender-typed individuals generally felt more uncomfortable, leading to decreased levels of self-esteem. However, androgynous subjects did not feel discomfort or pessimism about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Bem, S. L., Lenney, E. (1976). Sex typing and the avoidance of cross-sex behavior. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.'' 33(1), 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, gender typing can often lead to specific gender-rule stereotypes to better facilitate decision making which can adhere to certain benefits as well as limitations. Therefore, parents who foster more non-traditional views in sex role orientation tend to encourage a less discriminatory environment. The child can then freely engage in more choices that are not affected by gender limitations. Androgynous children have been found to have higher [[self-esteem]] and higher [[self-worth]].&lt;ref&gt;Witt, S. D. (1997). Parental influence on children’s socialization to gender roles. ''Adolescence.'' 253-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drawbacks'''
Recent{{When|date=April 2013}} studies have shown that gender typing is, in fact, not just related to gender-related characteristics that is congruous with the person's biological sex, but rather holds different dimensions. Several studies have also revealed the perks of androgynous individuals such as having more adaptability towards gender-specific situations as well as more flexible attitudes about sex roles. Therefore, while there appear to be many benefits for a gender-congruent identity, it can also result in limitations. Because gender typing often reinforces stereotypes, it tends to attract negative and rigid attitudes towards atypical gender characteristics, activities, and interests.&lt;ref&gt;DiDonato, M.D., Berenbaum, S.A. (2011). The benefits and drawbacks of gender typing: How different dimensions are related to psychological adjustment. ''Arch Sex Behavior.'' 40. 457-463&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforces the idea that gender-typing does result in certain limitations towards the construction of one's identity.

==Examples of atypical development==
'''Boy Raised as Girl'''
After a circumcision accident, Bruce's parents turned to Psychologist Dr. [[John Money]] who suggested they raise the boy as a girl. Money believes that [[biology]] does not determine our gender identification; our environment does. At 17 months old, Bruce was renamed "Brenda". However, at age 13, "Brenda" became unhappy, lonely, and refused to pursue anything female-typed. Brenda's parents chose to tell Brenda the truth, and from then on he named himself David. This story ended in tragedy; [[David Reimer|David]] committed suicide after his wife left him and he lost his job.&lt;ref&gt;Health Check: the boy who was raised as a girl. (2010). https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11814300&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kate:'''
Ben had never shown interest in “boy” toys, they wanted to wear girl's clothing and grow long hair. Soon they started to make their gender clear: they talked about being a girl and their identity not matching anatomy. Finally, Ben told family they would go by Kate. In the beginning, the child lived a double life. In school, she was “Ben”; at home, she was Kate. Characteristics between the two identities drastically varied. Ben was quiet, shy and withdrawn, while Kate was extroverted and happy. Her parents could see that this was taking a toll on Kate and so they changed to a school where Kate could attend as herself. As the parent learned through this experience, supporting a child's gender identity is extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;Matthiessen, C. Parent power: raising Kate: one mom’s fight for her child’s identity. http://www.greatschools.org/parenting/5085-raising-transgender-child.gs&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pop:'''
In [[Sweden]], there is a couple who raised their child, Pop, by keeping the child's gender a secret, despite a few people who changed the baby's diaper. The parents stated that they wanted the baby to grow up free and without a gender mold. Pop's wardrobe contains everything from pants to dresses. Pop's parents avoid using pronouns and just refer to their child as “Pop.”&lt;ref&gt;Parafianowicz, L. Swedish parents keep 2-year-old’s gender secret. (2009).

The flow profiles was first derived by [[John R. Womersley]] (1907–1958) in his work with blood flow in [[arteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Properties ==

=== Womersley number ===
The pulsatile flow profile changes its shape depending on the Womersley number

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = R \left( \frac{\omega \rho}{\mu} \right)^{1/2} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;\alpha \lesssim 2&lt;/math&gt;, viscous forces dominate the flow, and the pulse is considered [[Quasistatic equilibrium|quasi-static]] with a parabolic profile.
For &lt;math&gt;\alpha \gtrsim 2&lt;/math&gt;, the inertial forces are dominant in the central core, whereas viscous forces dominate near the boundary layer. Thus, the velocity profile gets flattened, and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] between the pressure and velocity waves gets shifted towards the core.

=== Function limits ===

==== Lower limit ====

The Bessel function at its lower [[Limit of a function|limit]] becomes&lt;ref name=Mestel&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\to\infty} J_0(z) = 1 - \frac{z^2}{4} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which converges to the [[Hagen-Poiseuille flow]] profile for steady flow for

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to 0} u(r, t) = - \frac{P'_0}{4 \mu}  \left(R^2 - r^2 \right) \, , &lt;/math&gt;

or to a [[Quasistatic equilibrium|quasi-static]] pulse with parabolic profile when

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\alpha \to 0} u(r, t) = Re \left\{ - \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{P'_n}{4 \mu}  (R^2 - r^2 ) \,  e^{i n \omega t} \right\} = - \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{P'_n}{4 \mu}  (R^2 - r^2 ) \, \cos(n \omega t) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the function is real, because the pressure and velocity waves are in phase.

==== Upper limit ====

The Bessel function at its upper limit it becomes&lt;ref name=Mestel/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\to\infty} J_0(z \, i) = \frac{e^z}{\sqrt{2\pi\, z}} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which converges to

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\to\infty} u(r, t) = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - e^{\alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{1/2} \left(\frac{r}{R} - 1 \right) } \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} = - \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{\, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - e^{\alpha \, n^{1/2}  \left(\frac{r}{R} - 1 \right) } \right] \sin(n\,\omega\, t) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

This is highly reminiscent of the Stokes layer on an oscillating flat plate, or the skin-depth penetration of an alternating magnetic field into an electrical conductor.
On the surface &lt;math&gt; u(r=R,t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, but the exponential term becomes negligible once &lt;math&gt;\alpha (1 - r/R)&lt;/math&gt; becomes large, the velocity profile becomes almost constant and independent of the viscosity. Thus, the flow simply oscillates as a plug profile in time according to the pressure gradient,

:&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = - \sum^N_{n=0} P'_n \,.&lt;/math&gt;

However, close to the walls, in a layer of thickness &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;, the velocity adjusts rapidly to zero. Furthermore, the phase of the time oscillation varies quickly with position across the layer. The exponential decay of the higher frequencies is faster.

== Derivation ==

For deriving the analytical solution of this non-stationary flow velocity profile, the following assumptions are taken:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*Fluid is [[homogeneous]], [[incompressible]] and [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]];
*Tube wall is [[Stiffness|rigid]] and [[Circle|circular]];
*Motion is [[Laminar flow|laminar]], [[axisymmetric]] and parallel to the tube's axis;
*[[Boundary conditions]] are: axisymmetry at the centre, and no-slip condition on the wall;
*Pressure gradient is a [[periodic function]] that drives the fluid;
*[[Gravitation]] has no effect on the fluid.

Thus, the [[Navier-Stokes equation]] and the [[continuity equation]] are simplified as

:&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =  -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\right) \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} =  0 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

respectively. The pressure gradient driving the pulsatile flow is decomposed in [[Fourier series]],

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} (t) = \sum^N_{n=0}P'_n e^{in\omega t} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary number]], &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the first [[harmonic]] (i.e., &lt;math&gt;n = 1&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;P'_n&lt;/math&gt; are the [[amplitudes]] of each harmonic &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Note that, &lt;math&gt;P'_0&lt;/math&gt; (standing for &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is the steady-state pressure gradient, whose [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] is opposed to the steady-state velocity (i.e., a negative pressure gradient yields positive flow). Similarly, the velocity profile is also decomposed in Fourier series in [[Phase (waves)|phase]] with the pressure gradient, because the fluid is incompressible,

:&lt;math&gt; u(r,t) = \sum^N_{n=0}U_n e^{in\omega t} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_n&lt;/math&gt; are the amplitudes of each harmonic of the periodic function, and the steady component (&lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is simply [[Poiseuille flow]]

:&lt;math&gt; U_0 = - \frac{P'_0}{4 \mu}  \left(R^2 - r^2 \right) \, . &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the Navier-Stokes equation for each harmonic reads as

:&lt;math&gt; i\rho n\omega U_n =  -P'_n +\mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 U_n}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial U_n}{\partial r}\right) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

With the boundary conditions satisfied, the general solution of this [[ordinary differential equation]] for the oscillatory part (&lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;  U_n(r) = A_n \, J_0 \left( \alpha \, \frac{r}{R} n^{1/2}\,i^{3/2} \right) + B_n \, Y_0 \left( \alpha \, \frac{r}{R} n^{1/2}\,i^{3/2} \right) + \frac{i\,P'_n}{\rho\, n\, \omega}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_0(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bessel function]] of first kind and order zero, &lt;math&gt;Y_0(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the Bessel function of second kind and order zero, &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = R \surd( \omega \rho / \mu )&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dimensionless]] [[Womersley number]]. The axisymetic boundary condition (&lt;math&gt;\partial U_n/ \partial r|_{r=0} = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is applied to show that &lt;math&gt;B_n = 0&lt;/math&gt; for the derivative of above equation to be valid, as the derivatives &lt;math&gt;J_0'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_0'&lt;/math&gt; approach infinity. Next, the wall non-slip boundary condition (&lt;math&gt;U_n(R) = 0&lt;/math&gt;) yields &lt;math&gt; A_n = - \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \frac{1}{ J_0 \left( \alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the amplitudes of the velocity profile of the harmonic &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; becomes

:&lt;math&gt;  U_n(r) = \frac{i\,P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{J_0(\alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2} \, \frac{r}{R})}{J_0(\alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2})} \right] = \frac{i\,P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n \, \frac{r}{R})}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_n = \alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt; is used for simplification.
The velocity profile itself is obtained by taking the [[Real number|real]] part of the [[complex function]] resulted from the [[summation]] of all harmonics of the pulse,

:&lt;math&gt; u(r, t) = \frac{P'_0}{4 \mu}  \left(R^2 - r^2 \right) + Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n \, \frac{r}{R})}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Flow rate ===
[[Discharge (hydrology)|Flow rate]] is obtained by integrating the velocity field on the cross-section. Since,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^p J_p(a\,x) \right] = a\,x^p J_{p-1} (a\, x)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ x\, J_1(a\,x) \right] = a\,x J_{0} (a\, x) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

then
 
:&lt;math&gt; Q(t) = \iint u(r, t) \, dA =  Re \left\{ \pi\,R^2 \, \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{2}{\Lambda_n}\frac{J_1(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

===Velocity profile===
[[File:Comparison of velocity profile of Womersley flow.svg|200px|thumb|Scaled velocity profiles of pulsatile flow are compared according to Womersley number.]]
To compare the shape of the velocity profile, it can be assumed that

:&lt;math&gt; 
 u(r,t) = f(r)\,\frac{Q(t)}{A} \, ,
&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to notice that this formulation ignores the inertial effects. The velocity profile approximates a parabolic profile or a plug profile, for low or high Womersley numbers, respectively.

=== Wall shear stress ===
For straight pipes, [[wall shear stress]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_w = \mu \left. \frac{\partial u}{\partial r} \right|_{r=R} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative of a Bessel function is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ x^{-p} J_{-p} (a\,x) \right] = a\,x^{-p} J_{p+1}(a\,x)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ J_0 (a\,x) \right] = -a\,J_1(a\,x) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_w = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} P'_n \frac{R}{\Lambda_n} \frac{J_1(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} e^{i n \omega t} \right\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Centre line velocity ===
If the pressure gradient &lt;math&gt;P'_n&lt;/math&gt; is not measured, it can still be obtained by measuring the velocity at the centre line. The measured velocity has only the real part of the full expression in the form of

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{u}(t) = Re(u(0, t)) \equiv \sum^N_{n=1} \tilde{U}_n \, \cos(n \, \omega \, t) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that &lt;math&gt;J_0(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the full physical expression becomes

:&lt;math&gt; u(0, t) = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n) - 1}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

at the centre line. The measured velocity is compared with the full expression by applying some properties of complex number. For any product of complex numbers (&lt;math&gt;C = AB&lt;/math&gt;), the amplitude and phase have the relations &lt;math&gt;|C| = |A||B|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_C = \phi_A + \phi_B&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Hence,

:&lt;math&gt; 
\tilde{U}_n = \left| \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n) - 1}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right| 
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
P'_n = \tilde{U}_n \left| i \, \rho \, n \, \omega \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n)}{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right|
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; 
\tilde{\phi} = 0 = \phi_{P'_n} + \phi_{U_n}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\phi_{P'_n} = \operatorname{phase} \left( \frac{i}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right) \, ,
&lt;/math&gt;

which finally yield

:&lt;math&gt; 
 \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = \sum^N_{n=1} \tilde{U}_n \left| i \, \rho \, n \, \omega \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n)}{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right| \, \cos \left\{ n\,\omega\,t + \operatorname{phase} \left( \frac{i}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right) \right\} \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

Allometric shifts will increase the overall variation in one trait relative to the other breaking their typical correlation]]
'''Allometric engineering''' is the process of experimentally shifting the [[allometry|scaling relationships]], for body size or shape, in a population of organisms. More specifically, the process of experimentally breaking the tight [[covariance]] evident among component traits of a complex [[phenotype]] by altering the [[variance]] of one [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] relative to another. Typically, body size is one of the two traits. The measurements of the two traits are plotted against each other and the scaling relationship can be represented as: &lt;math&gt; log(y) = mlog(x) + log(b) &lt;/math&gt;. Manipulations of this sort alter the scaling relationships either by shifting the intercept (''b''), slope (''m'') or both to create novel variants (see: [[Allometry]], for more details). These novel variants can then be tested for differences in performance or fitness. Through careful testing, one could sequentially test each component of a trait suite to determine how each part contributes to the function of the entire [[complex phenotype]], and ultimately the fitness of the organism. This technique allows for comparison within or among biological groups differing in size by adjusting morphology to match one another and comparing their performances.&lt;ref name=sinervo&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sinervo, B.  |author2=Huey, R. |year=1990 |title= Allometric Engineering: An Experimental Test of the Causes of Interpopulational Differences in Performance |pages= 1106–1109 |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=248 |doi= 10.1126/science.248.4959.1106 |url= http://faculty.washington.edu/hueyrb/pdfs/SinervoScience1.pdf |issue=4959 |pmid=17733374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and application==

===Lack's hypothesis===
Allometric engineering has been used to test [[David Lack]]'s hypothesis in the lizard ''[[Sceloporus occidentalis]]''.&lt;ref name=sinervo/&gt; In this study, two populations were "engineered" to fit the morphology of the other by manipulating egg yolk quantity, removing effect of size difference between groups. After manipulation, they found that speed was inversely proportional to body size.

===Nature versus nurture===
Maternal investment was "allometrically engineered" by surgically removing an ovary in cockroaches (''[[Diploptera punctata]]'').&lt;ref name=Holbrook&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Holbrook, G.  |author2=Schal, C.|year=2004|title=Maternal investment affects offspring phenotypic plasticity in a viviparous cockroach |journal=PNAS |volume=101 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0400209101 |pmc=397435| issue=15 |pages=5595–5597 | pmid=15064397}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively reduced number of progeny and increased resource allocation to each offspring. They coupled this manipulation with group effects (faster development in large groups), and found that maternal investment can overcome group effect.

===Sexual selection===
The male [[long-tailed widowbird]] (''Euplectes progne'') has exceptionally long tail feathers roughly half a meter in length.&lt;ref name=Andersson&gt;{{cite journal|author =Andersson, Malte|year=1982|title=Female choice selects for extreme tail length in a widowbird|doi=10.1038/299818a0|pages=818–820|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=299|issue=5886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Male tail feathers were cropped and glued and those with artificially enhanced tail lengths secured the most matings, demonstrating female preference.

===Natural selection===
The fly ''[[Zonosemata]] vittigera'' has a banding pattern on its wings that was found to mimic movements of a jumping spider. Greene ''et al.'' engineered novel phenotypes, breaking correlation between a behavior and morphology, by cutting and transplanting the wings of this fly with the common [[housefly]].&lt;ref name=Greene&gt;{{cite journal |author = Greene, E. |author2=Orsak, L. |author3=Whitman, D. |last-author-amp=yes |year=1987 |title=A Tephritid Fly Mimics the Territorial Displays of its Jumping Spider Predators |doi= 10.1126/science.236.4799.310 |pages= 310–312 |journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=236 |issue=4799 |pmid=17755555}} see: [[Tephritid fly]].&lt;/ref&gt; This manipulation demonstrated that it was behavior coupled with the banding pattern that deterred jumping spiders from attacking, though not other predators.

==Methods==
Current uses have involved truncation or cropping, yolk manipulation, hormonal treatments, maternal allocation, temperature manipulation, or altering the nutritional states.&lt;ref name=sinervo1&gt;{{cite journal |author = Sinervo, B. |year=1993 |title=The Effect of Offspring Size on Physiology and Life History |pages= 210–218 |volume=43 |issue=4 |jstor= 1312121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each method undoubtedly has its merits and pitfalls to consider before designing an experiment, but these techniques are opening new avenues of research in comparative and evolutionary biology.

[[File:Compensatory Growth.jpg|thumb|400px|Representation of compensatory growth]]

'''Compensatory growth''', known as '''catch-up growth''' and '''compensatory gain''', is an accelerated growth of an organism following a period of slowed development, particularly as a result of [[nutrient]] deprivation.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David E.

An organism can recover to normal weight without additional time.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; Sometimes when the nutrient restriction is severe, the growth period is extended to reach the normal weight.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; If the nutrient restriction is severe enough, the organism may have permanent [[stunted growth]] where it does not ever reach normal weight.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; Usually in animals, complete recovery from [[carbohydrate]] and [[protein]] restriction occurs.&lt;ref name="fundamentals of modern agriculture"/&gt;

==History==
In 1911, Hans Aron performed the earliest study of growth after periods of undernourishment.&lt;ref name="HenryUlijaszek1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. J. K. Henry|author2=Stanley J. Ulijaszek|title=Long-term consequences of early environment: growth, development, and the lifespan developmental perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66JbrqPjINgC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=6 June 2011|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-47108-4|pages=124–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underfed a dog and found that it still had the capacity to rapidly gain weight, though it did not reach the final weight of a dog that was fed normally.&lt;ref name="HenryUlijaszek1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aron&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aron|first=H.|year=1911 |title=Nutrition and growth|journal=Philippine Journal of Sciences, Section B (Medical Science) |volume=6|pages=1–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, Osborne and Mendel were the first to demonstrate that rats fed after growth restriction had an accelerated growth rate.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name="HenryUlijaszek1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Osborne&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Osborne|first1=T.B.|last2= Mendel |first2=L. B.|year=1915 |title=The resumption of growth after long continued failure to grow|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=23|pages=439–454}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, Brody developed the idea of “homoestasis of growth” in the book ''Bioenergetics and Growth''.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name="HenryUlijaszek1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brody"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Brody |title= Bioenergetics and Growth|year=1945|publisher= Reinhold }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Verle Bohman was the first to use the term “compensatory growth” in an article pertaining to [[beef cattle]].&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bohman&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bohman |first=V. R. |year=1955 |title= Compensatory Growth of Beef Cattle: The Effect of Hay Maturity |journal= Journal of Animal Science |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages= 249–255 |doi=10.2527/jas1955.141249x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
In animals, [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] and [[Homeorhesis|homeorhetic]] processes are involved in the abnormally high growth rates.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; Homeostatic processes usually affect compensatory growth in the short term, whereas homeorhetic processes usually have a long-term effect.&lt;ref name="LawrenceFowler2002"/&gt;

The exact biological mechanisms for compensatory growth are poorly understood, though it is clear that in some animals the [[endocrine system]] is involved in the [[metabolism]] and nutrient partitioning in the tissues.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanes2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. G. Scanes|title=Biology of growth of domestic animals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4Qau0BMeoIC&amp;pg=PA352|accessdate=6 June 2011|date=24 April 2003|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-2906-7|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;
First, during nutrient starvation, a reduction of [[Basal animal metabolic rate|basal metabolism]] takes place.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scanes2003"/&gt; The gut tissues are the first tissues to be reduced in weight and activity.&lt;ref name="Scanes2003"/&gt; Then, during the realimentation (re-feeding) phase, an increase in feeding enables more dietary protein and energy to be contributed for tissue growth instead of basal metabolism.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt; The gut tissues are the first to increase in weight, followed by muscle tissue and finally adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="Scanes2003"/&gt;

==Studies of growth in anorexic human patients==
[[Anorexia nervosa]] can have serious implications if its duration and severity are significant and if onset occurs before the completion of growth, pubertal maturation or prior to attaining peak bone mass.&lt;ref name="medical"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0968(200003)8:2&lt;170::AID-ERV338&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y|title=Medical complications of anorexia nervosa in children and young adolescents|year=2000|last1=Nicholls|first1=Dasha|last2=Stanhope|first2=Richard|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=8|issue=2|pages=170–180}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) from the pituitary gland. Suppression of gonadotropins in patients with anorexia nervosa has been frequently documented.&lt;ref name="medical"/&gt; In some cases, especially where onset is pre-pubertal, physical consequences such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually fully reversible.&lt;ref name="CG9FullGuideline"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health|year=2004 |title=Core interventions in the treatment and management of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and related eating disorders |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Height potential is normally preserved if the duration and severity of anorexia nervosa are not significant and/or if the illness is accompanied with delayed bone age (especially prior to a bone age of approximately 15 years), as hypogonadism may negate the deleterious effects of undernutrition on stature by allowing for a longer duration of growth compared to controls.&lt;ref name="pediatrics"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Factors affecting compensatory growth==
In 1960, Wilson and Osborne outlined six factors that could affect compensatory growth in a review article.&lt;ref name="LawrenceFowler2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt; The importance of each, some, or all of these factors is not well understood.&lt;ref name="fundamentals of modern agriculture"/&gt; These factors are as follows:&lt;ref name="LawrenceFowler2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fundamentals of modern agriculture"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;
*  The nature of the restricted diet
*  The degree of severity of undernutrition
*  The duration of the period of undernutrition
*  The stage of development at the commencement of undernutrition
*  The relative rate of maturity of the species
*  The pattern of re-alimenation

Animal factors that can affect compensatory growth may include the maturity level and fat proportion of the animal at the time of nutrient deprivation, the genotype, the gender, and the metabolic changes.&lt;ref name="LawrenceFowler2002"/&gt; The stage of development of the animal when the nutrient restriction occurs greatly affects its body composition.&lt;ref name="GerrardGrant2002"/&gt;

'''Biological dark matter''' is an informal term for unclassified or poorly understood genetic material. This genetic material may refer to genetic material produced by unclassified [[microorganism]]s.  By extension, biological dark matter may also refer to the un-isolated microorganism whose existence can only be inferred from the genetic material that they produce.

'''Despeciation''' is the loss of a unique species of animal due to its combining with another previously distinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Despeciation|url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=24093|work=Stedman's Medical Dictionary|accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the opposite of [[speciation]] and is much more rare.  It is similar to extinction in that there is a loss of a unique [[species]] but without the associated loss of a biological lineage. Despeciation has been noted in species of  butterflies, sunflowers, mosquitoes, fish, wolves, and even humans.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/two-become-one-raven-species-reverse-darwin-s-tree|title=Two become one: raven species reverse Darwin's tree {{!}} Cosmos|website=cosmosmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
A prime example of despeciation is convergent evolution due to the fact that it causes two species that live in same environment to become the same due to the similar functions and behaviors that it must partake in to survive in that habitat. Common examples of convergent evolution are [[Müllerian mimicry|Mullerian]] and [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian]] mimicry. Batesian mimicry is when one species that is harmless mimics a more threatening, or intimidating, species as to prevent it from being killed. Mullerian mimicry is when two organisms mimic each other as to prevent either species from being killed by predators.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zo.utexas.edu/courses/THOC/Convergence.html|title=Convergent Evolution|website=www.zo.utexas.edu|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despeciation also occurs when two diverged species begin to interact in the same region, as in the case of Holarctic and Californian ravens in North America.

== Examples ==
=== North American ravens ===
Holarctic Ravens and Californian Ravens had been two separate species for 1.5 million years until tens of thousands of years ago when their regions overlapped and they began to merge into a new species. This new raven species contains genes coming from both the Holarctic and Californian Raven. This was possible because they occupy the same area of the Western United States.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/biology/two-become-one-raven-species-reverse-darwin-s-tree|title=Two become one: raven species reverse Darwin's tree {{!}} Cosmos|website=cosmosmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Three-spined sticklebacks ===
[[Image:Gasterosteus aculeatus.jpg|thumb|left|The [[three-spined stickleback]] (''Gasterosteus aculeatus'')]]
Another possible cause for despeciation is increased gene flow and hybridization due to changes in the environment. One of these changes could include the loss of essential nourishment resources for each individual species.  For example, Taylor et al.'s genetic analysis of [[three-spined stickleback]]s across six lakes in southwestern [[British Columbia]] found two distinct species in 1977 and 1988 but only one combined species in data from 1997, 2000, and 2002. The new species is a hybrid and shows an intermediate form of the parental genotype.  They concluded that external factors had imperiled the living conditions of the two species, thus eliminating the evolutionary specializations that had kept them unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TAYLOR|first=E.

=== Humans ===
Human beings are considered to have undergone despeciation due to the genomes associated with early human remains like the Denisovans and Neanderthals, among others. These genomes show that human ancestors interbred with these other hominins.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;...... &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-despeciation.html|title=What Is Despeciation?|work=WorldAtlas|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signal-peptide-containing proteins==
These proteins contain a specific signal-peptide sequence, which is to be translated into the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], but are, however, able to reach the cell surface unconventionally. They can be packed into a COPII-coated vesicle and directly fuse with plasma membrane or can fuse with endosomal or lysosomal compartment. Alternatively, they can be packed into non-COPII-coated vesicle as well and fuse with Golgi (before reaching plasma membrane) or directly delivered to the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name="bla1"/&gt;

==Cytoplasmatic/nuclear secretory proteins==
Soluble proteins can reach the surface of the cell both by non-vesicular and vesicular mechanisms. Non-vesicular mechanisms use a carrier to get proteins into extracellular space (for example phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate). Vesicular mechanisms can  use the [[lysosome-dependent pathway]], [[microvesicle shedding]] or biogenesis of [[multivesicular bodies]].&lt;ref name="bla1"/&gt;

The 3D structures for A-RNA and B-DNA were used as a template for the design of the BNA monomers. The goal for the design was to find derivatives that possess high binding affinities with complementary RNA and/or DNA strands.

[[File:BNAH1.png|thumb|The 3D structures for A-RNA and B-DNA]]

[[File:BNAH2.png|thumb
The presence of 2’-hydroxyls in the RNA backbone favors a structure that resembles the A-form structure of DNA. The flexible five-membered [[furanose]] ring in nucleotides exists in [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] of two preferred conformations of the N- (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;’-endo, A-form) and the S-type (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;’-endo, B-form) as illustrated in the next figure.]]

An increased conformational inflexibility of the sugar moiety in [[nucleosides]] (oligonucleotides) results in a gain of high binding affinity with complementary single-stranded RNA and/or double-stranded DNA. The first 2’,4’-BNA (LNA) monomers were first synthesized by Takeshi Imanishi's group in 1997&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; followed independently by Jesper Wengel's group in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Koshkin|first1=A. A.|last2=Singh|first2=S. K.|last3=Nielsen|first3=P.|last4=Rajwanshi|first4=V. K.|last5=Kumar|first5=R.|last6=Meldgaard|first6=M.|last7=Olsen|first7=C.

[[File:BNAH6.png|thumb|Chemical structures of other BNAs that were synthesized in the past years as indicated below the structures.]]

BNA [[nucleotides]] can be incorporated into DNA or RNA [[oligonucleotides]] at any desired position. Such oligomers are synthesized chemically and are now commercially available. The bridged ribose conformation enhances base stacking and pre-organizes the backbone of the oligonucleotide significantly increasing their hybridization properties. 
 
The incorporation of BNAs into oligonucleotides allows the production of modified synthetic oligonucleotides with 
equal or higher binding affinity against an DNA or RNA complement with excellent single-mismatch discriminating power;  
better RNA selective binding; 
stronger and more sequence selective triplex-forming characters; 
pronounced higher nuclease resistance, even higher than  Sp-phosphorothioate analogues; and
good aqueous [[solubility]] of the resulting oligonucleotides when compared to regular DNA or RNA oligonucleotides.

[[File:BNAH8.png|thumb|
Chemical structures of BNAs were introduced in 2007 by Imanishi's group.&lt;ref name="AbdurRahman" /&gt; These new generation of BNAs analogues are called 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NH], 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NMe], and 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NBn].]]

New BNA analogs introduced by Imanishi's group were designed by taking the length of the bridged [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] into account. A six-membered bridged structure with a unique structural feature (N-O bond) in the sugar moiety was designed to have a nitrogen atom. This atom improves the formation of duplexes and triplexes by lowering the repulsion between the negatively charged backbone phosphates. These modifications allow to control the affinity towards complementary strands, regulate resistance against nuclease degradation and the synthesis of functional molecules designed for specific applications in genomics. The properties of these analogs were investigated and compared to those of previous 2’,4’-BNA (LNA) modified oligonucleotides by Imanishi's group. Imanishi's results show that “2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;-modified oligonucleotides with these profiles show great promise for applications in antisense and antigene technologies.”

[[File:BNAH9.png|thumb|Makoto Koizumi in 2004 reviewed the properties of BNAs with focus on ENAs as antisense and antigen oligonucleotides (AONs) and proposed an action mechanism for these compounds that may involve translation arrest, mRNA degradation mediated by RNase H and splicing arrest.]]

==Proposed mechanism of action of AONs==
Yamamoto et al. in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Koizumi|first1=M.|title=ENA oligonucleotides as therapeutics|journal=Current Opinion in Molecular Therapeutics|volume=8|issue=2|pages=144–149|year=2006|pmid=16610767 }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that BNA-based antisense therapeutics inhibited hepatic PCSK9 expression, resulting in a strong reduction of the serum LDL-C levels of mice. The findings supported the hypothesis that PCSK9 is a potential therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia and the researchers were able to show that BNA-based antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) induced cholesterol-lowering action in hypercholesterolemic mice.  A moderate increase of aspartate aminotransferase, ALT, and blood urea nitrogen levels was observed whereas the histopathological analysis revealed no severe hepatic toxicities. The same group, also in 2012, reported that the 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NMe] analog when used in antisense oligonucleotides showed significantly stronger inhibitory activities which is more pronounced in shorter (13- to 16mer) oligonucleotides. Their data led the researchers to conclude that the 2’,4’-BNA&lt;sup&gt;NC&lt;/sup&gt;[NMe] analog may be a better alternative to conventional LNAs.

==Benefits of the BNA technology==
Some of the benefits of BNAs include ideal for the detection of short RNA and DNA targets; increase the thermal stability of duplexes; capable of single nucleotide discrimination; increases the thermal stability of triplexes; resistance to exo- and enconucleases resulting in a high stability for ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro'' applications; increased target specificity; facilitate Tm normalization; strand invasion enables detection of “hard to access” samples; compatible with standard enzymatic processes.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==Application of the BNA technology==
Application of BNAs include small RNA research; design and synthesis of RNA aptamers; siRNA; antisense probes; diagnostics; isolation; microarray analysis; Northern blotting; real-time PCR; ''in situ'' hybridization; functional analysis; SNP detection and use as antigens and many others  nucleotide base applications.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The '''dorsal nexus''' is an area within the dorsal medial [[prefrontal cortex]] that serves as an intersection point for multiple [[brain]] networks. Research suggests it plays a role in the maintenance and manipulation of information, as well as supporting the control of cognitive functions such as behavior, memory, and conflict resolution. Abnormally increased connectivity between these networks through the Dorsal Nexus has been associated with certain types of depression. The activity generated by this abnormally high level of connectivity during a depressive state can be identified through [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[Positron emission tomography]] (PET).

==Anatomy and function==

The brain's intrinsic connections are divided into different networks that enable communication between the different structures: The cognitive control network, or [[Executive network]] (EN), the [[affective]] network or [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]] network, and the default mode network.&lt;ref name="Sheline"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sheline |first1=Yvette |last2=Yan |first2= Shizi |year= 2010 |title= Resting-state functional MRI in depression unmasks increased connectivity between networks via the dorsal nexus |journal= PNAS |volume= 107|issue= 24|pages= 11020–11025|doi= 10.1073/pnas.1000446107 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/05/24/1000446107 |accessdate=16 April 2013 |pmid=20534464 |pmc=2890754|bibcode=2010PNAS..10711020S }}&lt;/ref&gt; These regions are dependent on the dorsal nexus to communicate.&lt;ref name="Sheline"/&gt;

The EN is located in the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] and lateral parietal cortex, and is responsible for the maintenance and manipulation of the information in [[working memory]]. The EN also plays an important role as support of adaptive, goal-directed behaviors, which is why it is colloquially referred to as "the problem solver."&lt;ref name="Maletic, V."&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maletic |first1=Vladimir |year= 2012 |title=Role of Default Mode Network in Depression |publisher=Psych Congress Network|url=https://www.psychcongress.com/blog/role-default-mode-network-depression|accessdate=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The affective (or salience) network includes connections between the [[limbic]] area and [[subcortical]] areas, and is important during fear and vigilance states, as well as for autonomic and visceral regulation.&lt;ref name="Maletic, V."/&gt; It also generates the somatic sensations that accompany emotions.&lt;ref name=UHN&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year= |title= Depression and the Brain |journal= UHN RTMS Clinic |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |url= http://rtmsclinic.ca/?page_id=31  |accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The default mode is most active when the brain is at rest, or when a person is communicating socially. Its activity decreases during the performance of cognitively demanding tasks.&lt;ref name="Sheline"/&gt;

==Dorsal nexus and depression==
[[Neuroimaging]] studies have shown that many neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders are associated with abnormalities in the functional connectivity of [[neural networks]]. MRIs indicate that the dorsal nexus is responsible for connecting these networks, and this might explain how symptoms of depression are influenced by the state of brain networks.&lt;ref name="Sheline"/&gt; The increased connectivity can produce symptoms of decreased focus and increased vigilance, which can present as [[paranoia]], [[rumination (psychology)|rumination]] or autonomic, visceral and emotional imbalance.&lt;ref name=Lanfranco&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lanfranco |first1=Renzo|year= 2011 |title= Alteraciones de la conectividad funcional de la Default-Mode network en la depresión mayor:una breve mirada a la actividad intrínseca del cerebro |journal= Trastor|volume=7|issue=|pages=138147|doi=|url=http://neurocognitiva.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Lanfranco-R.-2011-Alteraciones-en-DMN-y-Depresión.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjects with depression were observed to have abnormal connectivity in the bilateral parahipocampal cortex, as well as an increase of hyperintensity of white matter. Increased default-mode network connectivity, mediated via a region of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, may underline the characteristics of depression. In this pathology, the dorsal nexus is strongly connected to the task-positive, task-negative and affective networks. The function of this node is to allow enhanced “cross-talk” between networks, and this may explain how the diverse symptoms seen in depression converge &lt;ref name=Norbury&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Norbury |first1=R |last2=Mannie |first2=Z |last3= Cowen|first3=PJ |year= 2011 |title=Imaging vulnerability for depression|journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=16 |issue= 4|pages=1067–1068|doi=10.1038/mp.2011.4|pmid=21423239 |pmc=4021719}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dorsal nexus can be related to two different types of depression: decreased and major depression. It is important to mention that there is a big difference between these two types: With decreased depression, the connectivity between the cingulated subgenual cortex and amygdala, pale striatum, and medial thalamus is diminished. In the case of major depression, connectivity is normal. This could explain differences in response to drugs and psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=Lanfranco/&gt;

==Diagnosis of depression involving dorsal nexus==
Neuroimaging techniques allow of imaging of the nervous system in vivo, and permit scientists to explore the structures and functions of the human brain. In [[neuropsychiatry]], neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and [[Positron Emission Tomography]] allow the identification of different networks that are implicated in various pathologies.&lt;ref name=UHN/&gt;

In the case of depression, portions of three different networks (the cognitive control network, the default mode network and the affective network) which are related with conflict resolution, making decisions, behavior, regulate memory and future planning present increased function in MRI’s. These three increased connectivity networks converged specifically on the dorsal nexus. The dorsal nexus has extremely high connectivity with large regions including dorso lateral prefrontal cortex, dorso medial prefrontal cortex, ventral medial prefrontal cortex, pregenual an subgenual cortex, posterior cingulate, and [[precuneus]]. Because these networks can be determined for each individual based on the strength of correlation to an a priori seed location, group statistical differences in networks can be evaluated on an image – wide basis.&lt;ref name="Sheline"/&gt;

==Treatment==
Treating the symptoms of depression has the purpose of reduce and control the dysfunction that patients could have in any areas of their life. The choice of treatment is based on the needs of the patient and can include drugs, therapy and other similar treatments. Regardless of the chosen treatment, it is necessary to consider possible side effects .&lt;ref name="Erowid Ketamine Vault: Dosage"&gt;[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/ketamine_dose.shtml Erowid Ketamine Vault: Dosage]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the case of depression associated with dorsal nexus and other associated structures, reducing the increased connectivity might play a critical role reducing depression [[symptomatology]] and thus represent a potential therapy target for affective disorders &lt;ref name=Sheidegger&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scheidegger |first1=Milan |last2=Walter |first3=Martin |last3= Lehmann|year= 2012 |title=Ketamine decreases resting state functional connectivity between networks via the dorsal nexus: implications for major depression |journal=Reson |volume=20 |issue= |pages=124|doi=|url=http://www.mr.ethz.ch/abstracts/files/ismrm12_0124.pdf |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[glutamate]] is the most abundant and major excitatory [[neurotransmitter]] in the brain, [[pathophysiological]] changes in glutamatergic signaling are likely to affect neurobehavioral plasticity, information processing and large-scales changes in functional brain connectivity.&lt;ref name=Sheidegger/&gt;[[Ketamine]], a fast-acting general [[anesthetic]] derived from [[phencyclidine]] and use as a pediatric inductor, plays a non-well known role in the [[neural network]] dynamics at the healthy brain . The administration of ketamine in abnormal brain has the potential of reduce the increased function of the networks that are seen in depression. The therapeutic potential of ketamine may be explained by reversing disturbances in the glutamatergic system and restoring parts of a disrupted neurobehavioral [[homeostasis]] where several structural, metabolic, and functional abnormalities have taken place.&lt;ref name=Sheidegger/&gt; Long term ketamine treatments lead to [[cognitive impairment]] including problems of short-term memory, visual and verbal memory. On the other hand, short term treatments are generally well tolerated and any damage may be reversible.&lt;ref name="Erowid Ketamine Vault: Dosage"/&gt;

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) significantly reduces functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Dorsal nexus) and the anterior cingulate cortex, the medial prefrontal cortex, and other areas implicated in major depression.&lt;ref name=Valero&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valero|first1=Tom|year=2012|title=FMRI Data Offer Clues about the Brain Mechanism Behind ECT for Severe Depression|journal=American Academy of Neurology|volume=|issue=|pages=|doi=|url=http://www.aan.com/elibrary/neurologytoday/?event=home.showArticle&amp;id=ovid.com:/bib/ovftdb/00132985-201205030-00003|accessdate=17 April 2013}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although electroconvulsive therapy has been used as a treatment for depression since 1930, it has several side effects as loss of memory, confusion and difficulties in forming new memories. Because of this reasons, this kind of treatment is limited to severely damaged patients.&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Norton |first1= Elizabeth |date=19 March 2012 |title= Insight Into a Shocking Therapy for Depression |journal= Science Now|volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |url= http://news.sciencemag.org/2012/03/insight-shocking-therapy-depression |accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sci. Technol. | volume = 36 | issue = 20 | pages = 4201–17 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12387389 | doi =  10.1021/es015848h}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modes of toxic action are important, widely used tools in [[ecotoxicology]] and [[aquatic toxicology]] because they classify [[toxicant]]s or [[pollution|pollutants]] according to their type of toxic action. There are two major types of modes of toxic action: non-specific acting toxicants and specific acting toxicants. Non-specific acting toxicants are those that produce [[narcotic|narcosis]], while specific acting toxicants are those that are non-narcotic and that produce a specific action at a specific target site.

== Types ==

=== Non-specific ===

[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Non-specific acting modes of toxic action]] result in [[narcotic|narcosis]]; therefore, narcosis is a mode of toxic action. Narcosis is defined as a generalized depression in [[biological activity]] due to the presence of [[toxicant]] [[molecules]] in the organism.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; The target site and mechanism of toxic action through which narcosis affects organisms are still unclear, but there are [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that support that it occurs through alterations in the [[cell membranes]] at specific sites of the membranes, such as the [[lipid bilayer|lipid layers]] or the [[proteins]] bound to the membranes. Even though continuous exposure to a [[narcotic]] toxicant can produce [[death]], if the exposure to the toxicant is stopped, narcosis can be reversible.

=== Specific ===

[[Toxicant]]s that at low [[concentrations]] modify or inhibit some biological process by binding at a specific site or [[molecule]] have a specific acting mode of toxic action.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; However, at high enough concentrations, toxicants with specific acting modes of toxic actions can produce [[narcotic|narcosis]] that may or may not be reversible. Nevertheless, the specific action of the toxicant is always shown first because it requires lower concentrations.

There are several specific acting modes of toxic action:
*'''''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation]]'''''. Involves toxicants that uncouple the two processes that occur in [[oxidative phosphorylation]]: [[electron transfer]] and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) production.
* '''''Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors'''''. [[Acetylcholinesterase|AChE]] is an [[enzyme]] associated with [[nerve]] [[synapses]] that it’s designed to regulate nerve impulses by breaking down the [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] (ACh). When toxicants bind to AChE, they inhibit the breakdown of ACh. This results in continued nerve impulses across the synapses, which eventually cause nerve system damage. Examples of AChE inhibitors are [[organophosphates]] and [[carbamates]], which are components found in [[pesticides]] (see [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors]]).
* '''''Irritants'''''. These are chemicals that cause an [[inflammation|inflammatory]] effect on living tissue by chemical action at the site of contact. The resulting effect of [[Irritation|irritants]] is an increase in the [[volume]] of cells due to a change in size ([[hypertrophy]]) or an increase in the number of cells ([[hyperplasia]]). Examples of irritants are [[benzaldehyde]], [[acrolein]], [[zinc sulphate]] and [[chlorine]].
* '''''Central nervous system (CNS) seizure agents'''''. [[Central nervous system|CNS]] seizure agents inhibit [[cellular signaling]] by acting as [[receptor antagonists]]. They result in the inhibition of biological responses. Examples of CNS seizure agents are [[organochlorine]] [[pesticides]].
* '''''Respiratory blockers'''''. These are toxicants that affect [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] by interfering with the [[electron transport chain]] in the [[mitochondria]]. Examples of respiratory blockers are [[rotenone]] and [[cyanide]].

== Determination ==

The pioneer work of identifying the major categories of modes of toxic action (see description above) was conducted by investigators from the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) at the Duluth Laboratory using fish,&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty93"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=McCarty LS, McCarty D | title = Enhancing ecotoxicological modeling and assessment: body residues and modes of toxic action|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology | year = 1993 | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 1719–1728 | doi=10.1021/es00046a001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="escher10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Escher BI, Ashauer R, Dyer S, Hermens JL, Lee JH, Leslie HA, Mayer P, Meador JP, Warne MS | title = Crucial role of mechanisms and modes of toxic action for understanding tissue residue toxicity and internal effect concentrations of organic chemicals | journal = Integr Environ Assess Manag | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–49 |date=January 2011 | pmid = 21184568 | doi = 10.1002/ieam.100  | url = https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1258&amp;context=usdeptcommercepub }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McKim JM, Schmieder PK, Carlson RW, Hunt EP | title = Use of respiratory-cardiovascular responses of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) in identifying acute toxicity syndromes in fish: Part 1. Pentachlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, tricaine methanesulfonate and 1-octanol | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1987 | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 295–312 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620060407}}&lt;/ref&gt; reason why they named the categories as ''[[Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes (FATS)|Fish Acute Toxicity Syndromes]]'' (FATS). They proposed the FATS by assessing the [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses of the fish when subjected to [[toxicity test]]s, such as [[locomotive]] activities, body [[color]], [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]] patterns, [[cough]] [[rate function|rate]], [[heart rate]], and others.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt;

It has been proposed that modes of toxic action could be estimated by developing a data set of critical body residues (CBR).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The CBR is the whole-body [[concentration]] of a chemical that is associated with a given adverse biological response&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; and it is estimated using a [[partition coefficient]] and a [[bioconcentration]] factor. The whole-body residues are reasonable first [[approximations]] of the amount of chemical present at the toxic action site(s).&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; Because different modes of toxic action generally appear to be associated with different ranges of body residues,&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; modes of toxic action can then be separated into categories. However, it is unlikely that every chemical has the same mode of toxic action in every organism, so this [[Heart rate variability|variability]] should be considered.&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; The effects of [[mixture]] toxicity should be considered as well, even though mixture toxicity it's generally [[additive map|additive]],&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; chemicals with more than one mode of toxic action may contribute to toxicity.&lt;ref name="escher10" /&gt;

[[Scientific modeling|Modeling]] has become a common used tool to predict modes of toxic action in the last decade. The [[mathematical model|models]] are based in [[Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship]]s (QSARs), which are [[mathematical models]] that relate the [[biological activity]] of molecules to their [[chemical structure]]s and corresponding chemical and [[Physical chemistry|physicochemical]] properties.&lt;ref name="rand" /&gt; QSARs can then predict modes of toxic action of unknown compounds by comparing its characteristic toxicity profile and chemical structure to reference compounds with known toxicity profiles and chemical structures.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Russom and colleagues&lt;ref name="russom"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Russom CL, Bradbury SP, Broderius SJ, Hammermeister DE, Drummond RA | title = Predicting modes of toxic action from chemical structure: acute toxicity in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | year = 1997 | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 948–967 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620160514}}&lt;/ref&gt; were one of the first group of researchers being able to classify modes of toxic action with the use of QSARs; they classified 600 chemicals as narcotics. Even though QSARs are a useful tool for predicting modes of toxic action, chemicals having multiple modes of toxic action can obscure QSAR analyses. Therefore, these models are continuously being developed.

== Applications ==

=== Environmental risk assessment ===

The objective of environmental [[risk assessment]] is to protect the environment from adverse effects.&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; Researchers are further developing QSAR models with the ultimate goal providing a clear insight about a mode of toxic action, but also about what the actual target site is, the concentration of the chemical at this target site, and the interaction occurring at the target site,&lt;ref name="escher02" /&gt; as well as to predict the modes of toxic action in [[mixtures]]. Information on the mode of toxic action is crucial not only in understanding joint toxic effects and potential interactions between chemicals in mixtures, but also for developing assays for the evaluation of complex mixtures in the field.

=== Regulation ===

The combination of [[behavioral]] and [[physiological]] responses, CBR estimates, and chemical fate and [[bioaccumulation]] QSAR models can be a powerful regulatory tool&lt;ref name="mccarty93" /&gt; to address [[pollution]] and toxicity in areas where [[effluents]] are discharged.

== Background of Polymer Biomaterials ==

=== Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) ===

[[polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] is a hydrophobic polymer composed of a carbon chain saturated with fluorine atoms. The fluorine-carbon bond is largely ionic, producing a strong dipole. The dipole prevents Teflon from being susceptible to [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals forces]], so other materials will not stick to the surface.&lt;ref name=teflon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/articles/material-matters/fluorinated-hyperbranched.html |title= Fluorinated Hyperbranched Polymers |last1= Mueller |first1= Anja |year= 2006 |work= Sigma Aldrich |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teflon is commonly used to reduce friction in biomaterial applications such as in arterial grafts, catheters, and guide wire coatings.

== Plasma modification of biomaterials ==

Plasma modification is one way to alter the surface of biomaterials to enhance their properties. During plasma modification techniques, the surface is subjected to high levels of excited gases that alter the surface of the material. Plasma's are generally generated with a [[Radio frequency|radio frequency (RF)]] field. Additional methods include applying a large (~1KV) DC voltage across electrodes engulfed in a gas. The plasma is then used to expose the biomaterial surface, which can break or form chemical bonds. This is the result of physical collisions or chemical reactions of the excited gas molecules with the surface. This changes the surface chemistry and therefore surface energy of the material which affects the adhesion, biocompatibility, chemical inertness, lubricity, and sterilization of the material. The table below shows several biomaterial applications of plasma treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Loh |first=Ih-Houng |work=AST Technical Journal |title=Plasma Surface Modification In Biomedical Applications |url=http://www.astp.com/PDFs/PSBiomed.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514091530/http://www.astp.com/PDFs/PSBiomed.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface Energy ===

The [[surface energy]] is equal to the sum of disrupted molecular bonds that occur at the interface between two different phases. Surface energy can be estimated by [[contact angle]] measurements using a version of the [[Young–Laplace equation]]:

&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{SV} - \gamma_{SL}= \gamma_{LV} cos\theta &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=CA&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1021/ba-1964-0043.ch001 |chapter=Relation of the Equilibrium Contact Angle to Liquid and Solid Constitution |title=Contact Angle, Wettability, and Adhesion |series=Advances in Chemistry |year=1964 |last1=Zisman |first1=W. A. |isbn=978-0-8412-0044-9 |volume=43 |pages=1–51 |editor1-first=Frederick M. |editor1-last=Fowkes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{SV}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension at the interface of solid and vapor, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{SL}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension at the interface of solid and liquid, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{LV}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension at the interface of liquid and vapor. Plasma modification techniques alter the surface of the material, and subsequently the surface energy. Changes in surface energy then alter the surface properties of the material.

=== Surface Functionalization ===

[[Surface modification]] techniques have been extensively researched for the application of adsorbing biological molecules. Surface functionalization can be performed by exposing surfaces to RF plasma. Many gases can be excited and used to functionalize surfaces for a wide variety of applications. Common techniques include using air plasma, oxygen plasma, and ammonia plasma as well as other exotic gases. Each gas can have varying effects on a substrate. These effects decay with time as reactions with molecules in air and contamination occur.

==== Plasma Treatment to Reduce Thrombogenesis ====

Ammonia plasma treatment can be used to attach amine functional groups.  These functional groups lock on to anticoagulants like Heparin decreasing thrombogenicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jbm.820270614 |title=Immobilization of high-affinity heparin oligosaccharides to radiofrequency plasma-modified polyethylene |year=1993 |last1=Yuan |first1=Shengmei |last2=Szakalas-Gratzl |first2=Gyongyi |last3=Ziats |first3=Nicholas P. |last4=Jacobsen |first4=Donald W. |last5=Kottke-Marchant |first5=Kandice |last6=Marchant |first6=Roger E. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=811–9 |pmid=8408111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Covalent Immobilization by Gas Plasma RF Glow Discharge ====

[[Polysaccharide]]s have been used as [[thin film]] coatings for biomaterial surfaces. Polysaccharides are extremely hydrophilic and will have small [[contact angle]]s. They can be used for a wide range of applications due to their wide range of compositions. They can be used to reduce the [[adsorption]] of proteins to biomaterial surfaces. Additionally, they can be used as receptor sites, targeting specific biomolecules. This can be used to activate specific biological responses.

Covalent attachment to a substrate is necessary to immobilize polysaccharides, otherwise they will rapidly desorb in a biological environment. This can be a challenge due to the fact that the majority of biomaterials do not possess the surface properties to covalently attach polysaccharides. This can be achieved by the introduction of [[amine|amine groups]] by RF glow discharge plasma.  Gases used to form amine groups, including ammonia or n-heptylamine vapor, can be used to deposit a thin film coating containing surface amines. Polysaccharides must also be activated by oxidation of anhydroglucopyranoside subunits. This can be completed with sodium metaperiodate (NaIO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). This reaction converts anhydroglucopyranoside subunits to cyclic hemiacetal structures, which can be reacted with amine groups to form a Schiff base linkage (a carbon-nitrogen double bond). These linkages are unstable and will easily [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]]. Sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN) can be used as a stabilizer by reducing the linkages back to an amine.&lt;ref name=immobilization&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9918(200001)29:1&lt;46::AID-SIA692&gt;3.0.CO;2-6 |title=Biomedical coatings by the covalent immobilization of polysaccharides onto gas-plasma-activated polymer surfaces |year=2000 |last1=Dai |first1=Liming |last2=Stjohn |first2=Heather A.

=== Surface Cleaning ===

There are many examples of contamination of biomaterials that are specific to the preparation or manufacturing process. Additionally, nearly all surfaces are prone to contamination of organic impurities in the air. Contamination layers are usually limited to a monolayer or less of atoms and are thus only detectable by surface analysis techniques, such as XPS. It is unknown whether this sort of contamination is harmful, yet it is still regarded as contamination and will most certainly affect surface properties.

Glow discharge plasma treatment is a technique that is used for cleaning contamination from biomaterial surfaces. Plasma treatment has been used for various biological evaluation studies to increase the surface energy of biomaterial surfaces, as well as cleaning.&lt;ref name=RFGD&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jbm.820290411|title=Effect of parallel surface microgrooves and surface energy on cell growth |year=1995 |last1=den Braber |first1=E.T. |last2=de Ruijter |first2=J.E. |last3=Smits |first3=H.T.J |last4=Ginsel |first4=L.A. |last5=von Recum |first5=A.F. |last6=Jamsen |first6=J.A. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research |volume=29 |pages=511–518 |pmid=7622536 |issue=1|hdl=2066/21896 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma treatment has also been proposed for [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] of biomaterials for potential implants.&lt;ref name=glow&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4636(199704)35:1&lt;49::AID-JBM6&gt;3.0.CO;2-M |title=Glow discharge plasma treatment for surface cleaning and modification of metallic biomaterials |year=1997 |last1=Aronsson |first1=B.-O. |last2=Lausmaa |first2=J. |last3=Kasemo |first3=B. |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=49–73 |pmid=9104698}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Glow Plasma Discharge Schematic Polymer Chemistry.png|framed|center|Schematic of cleaning of a polymer surface using glow plasma discharge. Note the removal of adsorbed molecules and presence of dangling bonds.]]

== Modification of Biomaterials with Polymer Coatings ==

Another method of altering surface properties of biomaterials is to coat the surface. Coatings are used in many applications to improve biocompatibility and alter properties such as adsorption, lubricity, thrombogenicity, degradation, and corrosion.

=== Adhesion of Coatings ===

In general, the lower the surface tension of a liquid coating, the easier it will be to form a satisfactory wet film from it. The difference between the surface tension of a coating and the surface energy of a solid substrate to which a coating is applied affects how the liquid coating flows out over the substrate. It also affects the strength of the adhesive bond between the substrate and the dry film. If for instance, the surface tension of the coating is higher than the surface tension of the substrate, then the coating will not spread out and form a film. As the surface tension of the substrate is increased, it will reach a point to where the coating will successfully wet the substrate but have poor adhesion. Continuous increase in the coating surface tension will result in better wetting in film formation and better dry film adhesion.&lt;ref name=SurfaceTension&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pra-world.com/technical_services/laboratory/testing/surface-tension |title= Surface Tension, Surface Energy, Contact Angle and Adhesion |year= 2013 |work= Paint Research Association |accessdate= 22 May 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130109105050/http://www.pra-world.com/technical_services/laboratory/testing/surface-tension |archivedate= 9 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically whether a liquid coating will spread across a solid substrate can be determined from the surface energies of the involved materials by using the following equation:

&lt;math&gt; S =  \gamma_{SA} + (\gamma_{CA} - \gamma_{SC}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=teflonse /&gt;

Where S is the coefficient of spreading,  &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{SA} &lt;/math&gt; is the surface energy of the substrate in air, &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{CA} &lt;/math&gt; is the surface energy of the liquid coating in air and &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{SC} &lt;/math&gt; is the interfacial energy between the coating and the substrate. If S is positive the liquid will cover the surface and the coating will adhere well. If S is negative the coating will not completely cover the surface, producing poor adhesion.

==== Corrosion Protection ====

Organic coatings are a common way to protect a metallic substrate from [[corrosion]]. Up until ~1950 it was thought that coatings act as a physical barrier which disallows moisture and oxygen to contact the metallic substrate and form a corrosion cell. This cannot be the case because the [[Permeation|permeability]] of paint films is very high. It has since been discovered that corrosion protection of steel depends greatly upon the adhesion of a noncorrosive coating when in the presence of water. With low adhesion, osmotic cells form underneath the coating with high enough pressures to form blisters, which expose more unprotected steel. Additional non-osmotic mechanisms have also been proposed. In either case, sufficient adhesion to resist displacement forces is required for corrosion protection.&lt;ref name=CoatingsBook&gt;{{cite book|author1=Z.W. Wicks |author2=Frank N. Jones |author3=S Peter Pappas |author4=Douglas A. Wicks | title = Organic Coatings Science and Technology | edition = 2nd expanded | location = New Jersey | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]] }}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guide Wires ===

Guide wires are an example of an application for biomedical coatings. Guide wires are used in [[percutaneous coronary intervention|coronary angioplasty]] to correct the effects of [[coronary artery disease]], a disease that allows plaque build up on the walls of the arteries. The guide wire is threaded up through the femoral artery to the obstruction. The guide wire guides the balloon catheter to the obstruction where the catheter is inflated to press the plaque against the arterial walls.&lt;ref name=angioplasty&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/anatomyvideos/000096.htm |title= Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) |last1= Gandelman |first1= Glenn |date= March 22, 2013 |work= Medline Plus |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guide wires are commonly made from stainless steel or [[Nickel Titanium|Nitinol]] and require polymer coatings as a surface modification to reduce friction in the arteries. The coating of the guide wire can affect the trackability, or the ability of the wire to move through the artery without kinking, the tactile feel, or the ability of the doctor to feel the guide wire's movements, and the thrombogenicity of the wire.

==== Hydrophilic Coatings ====

Hydrophilic coatings can reduce friction in the arteries by up to 83% when compared to bare wires due to their high surface energy.&lt;ref name=friction&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8485751 |year=1993 |last1=Schröder |first1=J |title=The mechanical properties of guidewires. Part III: Sliding friction |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=93–7 |journal=Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology |doi=10.1007/BF02602986}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the hydrophilic coatings come into contact with bodily fluids they form a waxy surface texture that allows the wire to slide easily through the arteries. Guide wires with hydrophilic coatings have increased trackability and are not very thrombogenic; however the low coefficient of friction increases the risk of the wire slipping and perforating the artery.&lt;ref name=techniques&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Andrejs |last1=Erglis |first2=Inga |last2=Narbute |first3=Dace |last3=Sondore |first4=Alona |last4=Grave |first5=Sanda |last5=Jegere |title=Tools &amp; Techniques: coronary guidewires  |journal=EuroIntervention |url=http://www.pcronline.com/eurointervention/tools-and-techniques/coronary-guidewires/download_pdf.php |pmid=20542813 |year=2010 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=168–9 |doi=10.4244/eijv6i1a24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hydrophobic Coatings ====

Teflon and [[Silicone]] are commonly used [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] coatings for coronary guide wires. Hydrophobic coatings have a lower surface energy and reduce friction in the arteries by up to 48%.&lt;ref name=friction/&gt;  Hydrophobic coatings do not need to be in contact with fluids to form a slippery texture. Hydrophobic coatings maintain tactile sensation in the artery, giving doctors full control of the wire at all times and reducing the risk of perforation; though, the coatings are more thrombogenic than hydrophilic coatings.&lt;ref name=techniques/&gt; The thrombogenicity is due to the proteins in the blood adapting to the hydrophobic environment when they adhere to the coating. This causes an irreversible change for the protein, and the protein remains stuck to the coating allowing for a blood clot to form.&lt;ref name=thrombo&gt;{{cite journal |first=Denis |last=Labarre |title=Improving blood compatibility of polymeric surfaces |journal=Trends in Biomaterials &amp; Artificial Organs |year=2001 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–3 |url=http://www.biomaterials.org.in/ojs/index.php/tibao/article/view/5 |access-date=2013-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064255/http://www.biomaterials.org.in/ojs/index.php/tibao/article/view/5 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Magnetic Resonance Compatible Guide Wires ====

Using an [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]] to image the guide wire during use would have an advantage over using x-rays because the surrounding tissue can be examined while the guide wire is advanced. Because most guide wires' core materials are stainless steel they are not capable of being imaged with an MRI. Nitinol wires are not magnetic and could potentially be imaged, but in practice the conductive nitinol heats up under the magnetic radiation which would damage surrounding tissues. An alternative that is being examined is to replace contemporary guide wires with PEEK cores, coated with iron particle embedded synthetic polymers.&lt;ref name=MRI&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jmri.20486 |title=A polymer-based MR-compatible guidewire: A study to explore new prospects for interventional peripheral magnetic resonance angiography (ipMRA) |year=2006 |last1=Mekle |first1=Ralf |last2=Hofmann |first2=Eugen |last3=Scheffler |first3=Klaus |last4=Bilecen |first4=Deniz |journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=145–55 |pmid=16374877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="6370" xml:space="preserve">'''Phytogeomorphology''' is the study of how [[terrain]] features affect plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J.A., Mitchell, C.W., 1985. Phytogeomorphology. ''Wiley''.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the subject of a [[treatise]] by Howard and Mitchell in 1985, who were considering the growth and varietal temporal and spatial variability found in forests, but recognized that their work also had application to [[agriculture|farming]], and the relatively new science (at that time) of [[precision agriculture]].  The premise of Howard and Mitchell is that [[landform]]s, or features of the land's 3D [[topography]] significantly affect how and where plants (or trees in their case) grow.  Since that time, the ability to map and classify landform shapes and features has increased greatly.  The advent of [[GPS]] has made it possible to map almost any variable one might wish to measure.  Thus, a very increased awareness of the spatial variability of the environment that plants grow in has arisen.  The development of technology like airborne [[LiDAR]] has enabled the detailed measurement of landform features to better than sub-meter, and when combined with [[RTK-GPS]] (accuracies to 1mm) enables the creation of very accurate maps of where these features are.  Comparison of these landform maps with mapping of variables related to crop or plant growth show a strong correlation (see below for examples and references for precision agriculture).

==Phytogeomorphology and Precision Agriculture==
While phytogeomorphology studies the relationship between plants and terrain attributes in general (see Howard et al., (1985)), it can also apply to [[precision agriculture]] by studying crop growth temporal and spatial variability within farm fields.  There is already a volume of work, although they don't use the term phytogeomorphology specifically, that considers farm field terrain attributes as affecting crop yield and growth, Moore et al. (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Moore, I.D., Grayson, R.B., Ladson, A.R., 1991. Digital Terrain Modelling: A review of hydrological, geomorphological, and biological applications. ''Hydrological Processes'', Vol. 5, 3-30&lt;/ref&gt; provide an early overview of the application of terrain features to precision agriculture, but one of the earliest references to this phenomenon in farming is that of Whittaker in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, R.H. 1967. Gradient analysis of vegetation, ''Biological Reviews'', 42, 207-264&lt;/ref&gt; More recent work includes a six-year study of temporal and spatial yield stability over 11 years (Kaspar et al., (2003), and references therein),&lt;ref&gt;Kaspar, T.C, Colvin, T.S., Jaynes, B., Karlen, D.L., James, D.E, Meek, D.W., 2003. Relationship between six years of corn yields and terrain attributes. ''Precision Agriculture'', 4, 87-101.&lt;/ref&gt; and a detailed study of the same on a small patch farm in Portugal (and references therein).&lt;ref&gt;Marquas da Silva, J.R., and Silva, L.L., 2008. Evaluation of the relationship between maize yield spatial and temporal variability and different topographic attributes. ''Biosystems Engineering'', 101, 183-190.&lt;/ref&gt;  This variability can be exploited to produce higher yields and reduce the environmental impact of farming - consequently returning a higher profit to the farmer in terms of higher overall yields and lesser amounts of inputs.  The new science of Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, T. et al., 2013. Sustainable Intensification in Agriculture: Premise and Policies. ''Science'', Vol. 341, 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; which is addressing the need for higher yields from existing fields can be fulfilled by some of the practical applications of phytogeomorphology applied to precision agriculture.

Work in this area has been happening for some years (see Reuter et al., (2005),&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, H.I., Giebel, A., Wendroth, O., 2005. Can Landform Stratification Improve Our Understanding of Crop Yield Variability. ''Precision Agriculture'', 6, 521-537.&lt;/ref&gt; Marquas de Silva et al., (2008), and especially Moore et al., (1991)), but it is slow and sometimes tedious work that necessarily involves multiple years of data, very specialized software tools, and long compute times to produce the resulting maps.

==Phytogeomorphologically defined Management Zones==
Typically, the objective of precision agriculture is to divide the farm field into distinct [[management zones]] based on [[Crop yield|yield]] performance at each point in the field. 'Variable rate technology' is a relatively new term in farming technology that refers to [[Broadcast spreader|spreader]]s, [[seeder]]s, [[sprayer]]s, etc. that are able to adjust their rates of flow on the fly.  The idea is to create a 'recipe map' for variable rate farm machinery to deliver the exact quantity of amendments required at that location (within that zone of the field).  The literature is divided on how to properly define management zones.

In the geomorphological approach to defining management zones it is found that topography aids in at least partially defining how much yield comes from which part of the field.  This is true in fields where there are permanently limiting characteristics to parts of the field, but not true in fields where the growth potential is the same all over the field (Blackmore et al., (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, S., Godwin, R.J., Fountas, S., 2003. The Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Trends in Yield Map Data over Six Years. ''Biosystems Engineering'', 84(4), 455-466&lt;/ref&gt;). It can be shown that an index map of yield (shows areas of consistent over-performance of yield and areas of consistent under-performance) correlates well with a landform classification map (personal communication, Aspinall (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Aspinall, D., 2011. Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food (OMAF).&lt;/ref&gt;).  Landforms can be classified a number of ways, but the simplest to use software tool is [[LandMapR]] (MacMillan (2003)&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan, R.A., VanDeusen, A.A., 2003. The LandMapR User's Guide. Self-Published&lt;/ref&gt;).  An early version of the LandMapR software is available through the [[Opengeomorphometry project]] hosted under the [[Google Code project]].

'''Trabecular cartilages''' ('''trabeculae cranii''', sometimes simply '''trabeculae''', '''prechordal cartilages''') are paired, rod-shaped cartilages, which develop in the [[head]] of the [[vertebrate]] [[embryo]]. They are the primordia of the anterior part of the [[Base of skull|cranial base]], and are derived from the [[cranial neural crest|cranial neural crest cells]].

==Structure==
[[File:Shark Lacerta deBeer1937.jpg|thumb|330px|Morphogenesis of neurocranium (shark and lizard).]]
The trabecular cartilages generally appear as a paired, rod-shaped cartilages at the ventral side of the [[forebrain]] and lateral side of the [[adenohypophysis]] in the vertebrate embryo. During development, their anterior ends fuse and form the ''trabecula communis''. Their posterior ends fuse with the caudal-most [[parachordal cartilages]].

===Development===
Most [[skeletons]] are of [[mesodermal]] origin in vertebrates. Especially axial skeletal elements, such as the vertebrae, are derived from the paraxial mesoderm (e.g., [[somites]]), which is regulated by molecular signals from the [[notochord]]. Trabecular cartilages, however, originate from the neural crest, and since they are located anterior to the rostral tip of the notochord,&lt;ref&gt;their derivatives are called the ''prechordal cranium'' (Couly et al., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; they cannot receive signals from the notochord. Due to these specialisations, and their essential role in cranial development, many comparative morphologists and embryologists have argued their developmental or evolutionary origins. The general theory is that the trabecular cartilage is derived from the neural crest mesenchyme which fills anterior to the mandibular arch (premandibular domain).

==Other animals==
===Lamprey===
As clearly seen in the [[lamprey]], [[Cyclostome]] also has a pair of cartilaginous rods in the embryonic head which is similar to the trabecular cartilages in jawed vertebrates.
However, in 1916, [[Alexej Nikolajevich Sewertzoff]] pointed out that the cranial base of the lamprey is exclusively originated from the paraxial mesoderm. Then in 1948, [[:de:Alf Johnels|Alf Johnels]] reported the detail of the skeletogenesis of the lamprey, and showed that the “trabecular cartilages” in lamprey appear just beside the notochord, in a similar position to the parachordal cartilages in jawed vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Johnels AG (1948) On the development and morphology of the skeleton of the head of Petromyzon. Acta Zool 29: 139-279&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experimental studies also showed that the cartilages are derived from the head mesoderm.&lt;ref&gt;Kuratani S ''et al''., (2004) Developmental fate of the mandibular mesoderm in the lamprey, Lethenteron japonicum: comparative morphology and development of the gnathostome jaw with special reference to the nature of trabecula cranii. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.). 302B, 458-468&lt;/ref&gt; The “trabecular cartilages” in the Cyclostome is no longer considered to be the homologue of the trabecular in the jawed vertebrates: the (true) trabecular cartilages were firstly acquired in the Gnathostome lineage.

==History==
{{refimprove-section|date=August 2017}}
The trabecular cartilages were first described in the [[grass snake]] by [[:de:Martin Heinrich Rathke|Martin Heinrich Rathke]] at 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Entwicklungsgeschichte der Natter. Konigsberg (1839)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] suggested that the trabecular cartilages are a modified part of the [[splanchnocranium]]: they arose as the serial homologues of the [[pharyngeal arches]].{{fact|date=August 2017}}

The vertebrate [[jaw]] is generally thought to be the modification of the [[mandibular arch]] (1st pharyngeal arch). Since the trabecular cartilages appear anterior to the mandibular arch, if the trabecular cartilages are serial homologues of the pharyngeal arches, ancestral vertebrates should possess more than one pharyngeal arch (so-called "premandibular arches") anterior to the mandibular arch. The existence of premandibular arch(es) has been accepted by many comparative embryologists and morphologists (e.g., [[Edwin Stephen Goodrich]], [[Gavin de Beer]]). Moreover, [[:de: Erik Stensio|Erik Stensio]] reported premandibular arches and the corresponding branchiomeric nerves by the reconstruction of the [[Osteostraci|Osteostracans]] (e.g., ''[[Cephalaspis]]''; recently this arch was reinterpreted as the mandibular arch)

However, the existence of the premandibular arch(es) has been rejected, and the trabecular cartilages are no longer assumed to be one of the pharyngeal arches.

'''Endogenous''' substances and processes are those that originate from within a system such as an [[organism]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], or [[Cell (biology)|cell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=endogenous |title=Endogenous &amp;#124; Define Endogenous at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is chiefly used in biology but also in other fields.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The term has also been applied to sociological concepts. See (Vasey 2002 p. 8). &lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous substances and processes contrast with [[exogenous]] ones, such as [[Drug|drugs]], which originate from outside of the organism. 

== Endogenous substances ==
[[Cell signaling|Cell signalling]] systems such as [[hormone]] and [[neurotransmitter]] systems use endogenous substances. Endogenous substances can regulate sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rT7clpjUwaEC|title=Biology of Sleep Substances|last=Inoue|first=Shojiro|date=1989-03-31|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780849348228|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|1}} Examples of endogenous substances, and systems that use them, include

* The [[Endocannabinoid system|endogenous cannabinoid system]], from which the term "endocannabinoid" derives.

Endogenous [[transcription factor]]s are those manufactured by the cell, as distinguished from cloned transcription factors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Endogenous substances typically have some physiological utility. However substances can also be pathologically endogenous. For example, in [[auto-brewery syndrome]], ethanol is endogenously produced within the digestive system through endogenous fermentation of sugars.

Endogeneity can, in some [[biology|biological]] systems, particularly with [[Virus|viruses]] and [[prokaryote]]s, pertain to [[DNA]] incorporated (endogenized) into the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clément Gilbert|last2=Feschotte|first2=Cédric|date=2012|title=Endogenous viruses: insights into viral evolution and impact on host biology|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=283–296|doi=10.1038/nrg3199|pmid=22421730|issn=1471-0064|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00679842/file/Feschotte_2012_endegenousvirusesNRG.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of [[homeostasis]]{{Why|date=June 2019|reason=Why does homeostasis change this?}}, discerning between internal and external influences is often difficult.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} [[Endogenous viral element]]s, which are [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequences]] derived from [[virus]]es that are ancestrally inserted into the [[genome]]s of [[germ cell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} These sequences, which may be fragments of viruses or entire viral genomes ([[provirus|proviruses]]), can persist in the [[germline]], being passed on from one generation to the next as host [[allele]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} [[Endogenous retrovirus|Endogenous retroviruses]] are a type of endogenous viral element.

== Endogenous processes ==
Endogenous effects can modulate and regulate systems, in conjunction with environmental influences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XcrrGBbT9eEC|title=An Ecological History of Agriculture 10,000 B.C.-A.D. 10,000|last=Vasey|first=Daniel E.|publisher=Purdue University Press|year=2002|isbn=9781557532725|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|8}}

Endogeny can refer to changes that originate from within a system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|8}} Endogenous changes can occur in social systems and can be modelled by Marxian dialectics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|8}}

Orthogenesis is a similar concept to endogeny but refers to changes within separate systems that results in their evolution along similar paths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|8}} The concept of orthogenesis has never been widely favored in evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|8}}

Examples of endogenous processes include:

* [[Senescence]] (biological aging)
* The [[menstrual cycle]]
* The self-sustained [[circadian rhythm]]s of plants and animals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}
* [[Endogenous regeneration]], which refers to the ability of cells to engage in the repair and [[Regeneration (biology)#Humans|regeneration]] process.
* Endogenous [[Chronobiology|biological clocks]] and biological rhythms originating from endogenous mechanisms allow forms of biochronometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PaqgQ_QddoUC|title=An Introduction to Biological Rhythms|last=Palmer|first=John|date=2012-12-02|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780323152426|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|281-282}}

Endogenous processes can also be pathological. For example, [[endogenous depression]] is an atypical type of depression caused by internal effects, such as cognitive and biological stressors.

{{more citations needed section|date=June 2019}}

=== Geography ===
All processes that take place inside [[Earth]] (and other [[Planet|planets]]) are considered endogenous. They make the [[continents]] migrate, push the [[mountains]] up, and trigger [[earthquakes]] and [[volcanism]]. Endogenous processes are driven by the warmth that is produced in the core of Earth by [[radioactivity]] and [[gravity]].

=== Psychology ===
An [[emotion]] or [[behavior]] is endogenous if it is spontaneously generated from an individual's internal state.

=== Economics and finance ===
{{Main|Endogeneity (economics)}}
A variable is called '''endogenous''' if it is explained within the model in which it appears. For example, in a supply and demand model of an agricultural market, the [[price]] and quantity of trade would be the endogenous variables explained by the model; changes in the weather or in consumer tastes would be exogenous variables that might shift the supply and demand curves.

=== Political science ===
In [[political science]], something is endogenous if it is actually the result of the action for which it is generally labeled the cause{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.  For example, ethnic violence is generally thought to be caused by ethnic division.  However, endogeny would say that ethnic divisions are a result of [[ethnic violence]].

These properties play an important role in genome instability&lt;ref name=Voineagu /&gt; and contribute not only to [[cellular evolution]] and [[genetic diversity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lin|first=CT|author2=Lin, WH |author3=Lyu, YL |author4= Whang-Peng, J |title=Inverted repeats as genetic elements for promoting DNA inverted duplication: implications in gene amplification|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Sep 1, 2001|volume=29|issue=17|pages=3529–38|pmid=11522822|doi=10.1093/nar/29.17.3529|pmc=55881}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also to [[mutation]] and [[disease]].&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;  In order to study these effects in detail, a number of programs and databases have been developed to assist in discovery and annotation of inverted repeats in various genomes.

==Understanding inverted repeats==

===Example of an inverted repeat===
[[File:Inverted-Repeat.gif|thumb|500px|left|The 5 base-pair sequence on the left is "repeated" and "inverted" to form sequence on the right.]]

Beginning with this initial sequence:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{color|blue|5'-TTACG-3'}}

The complement created by base pairing is:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{color|green|3'-AATGC-5'}}

The reverse complement is:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{color|green|5'-CGTAA-3'}}

And, the inverted repeat sequence is:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; {{color|blue|5'---TTACGnnnnnn}}{{color|green|CGTAA---3'}}

"nnnnnn" represents any number of intervening nucleotides.
{{Clear}}
&lt;!--
===Direct repeat vs. inverted repeat===
A well-defined direct repeat is that which has a duplicated sequence as follows:&lt;ref name=Bissler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bissler|first=JJ|title=DNA inverted repeats and human disease.|journal=Frontiers in Bioscience|date=Mar 27, 1998|volume=3|pages=d408-18|pmid=9516381|doi=10.2741/a284}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:::{{color|blue|5´ '''ACATACA'''ACATACA 3´}}
:::{{color|green|3´ '''TGTATGT'''TGTATGT 5´}}
The nucleotide sequence written in bold characters signifies the repeated sequence.&lt;ref name=Bissler&gt;{{cite journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically, a typical direct repeat is comparable to saying "bye-bye".&lt;ref name=Bissler&gt;{{cite journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is similarity between direct and inverted repeat, or else a palindrome, with the exception of the second half of the inverted repeat positioned in the complementary strand as follows:&lt;ref name=Bissler&gt;{{cite journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:::{{color|blue|5´ '''ACATACG'''CGTATGT 3´}}
:::{{color|green|3´ TGTATGC'''GCATACA''' 5´}}
The last repeats suggest that palindromes can be related linguistically to a string of characters that reads the same in both directions, such as "level". In all, repeated sequence without the [[complementarity (molecular biology)|reverse complement]] and without inversion, is a [[direct repeat]].&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt; Based on the same initial sequence discussed above in the section titled "understanding inverted repeats", a direct repeat would be: {{color|blue|5' TTACGnnnnnnTTACG 3'}}
--&gt;

===Vs. direct repeat===
A direct repeat occurs when a sequence is repeated with the same pattern downstream.&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt;  There is no inversion and no reverse complement associated with a direct repeat. The nucleotide sequence written in bold characters signifies the repeated sequence. It may or may not have intervening nucleotides.
:::{{color|blue |5´ '''TTACG'''nnnnnnTTACG 3´}}
:::{{color|green|3´ '''AATGC'''nnnnnnAATGC 5´}}
Linguistically, a typical direct repeat is comparable to saying "bye-bye".&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt;

===Vs. palindrome===
An inverted repeat sequence with ''no'' intervening nucleotides between the initial sequence and its downstream [[complementarity (molecular biology)|reverse complement]] is a [[palindromic sequence|palindrome]].&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; EXAMPLE:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Step 1: start with an inverted repeat: {{color|blue|5' TTACGnnnnnnCGTAA 3'}}&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Step 2: remove intervening nucleotides: {{color|blue|5' TTACGCGTAA 3'}}&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This resulting sequence is palindromic because it is the reverse complement of itself.&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt;
:::{{color|blue|5' TTACGCGTAA 3'}} &amp;nbsp; test sequence (from Step 2 with intervening nucleotides removed)
:::{{color|green|3' AATGCGCATT 5'}} &amp;nbsp; complement of test sequence
:::{{color|blue|5' TTACGCGTAA 3'}} &amp;nbsp; reverse complement &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This is the same as the test sequence above, and thus, it is a palindrome.

===Conditions that favor synthesis===
The diverse genome-wide repeats are derived from [[transposable element]]s, which are now understood to "jump" about different genomic locations, without transferring their original copies.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite book|last=School|first=James D. Watson, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Tania A. Baker, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stephen P.

===Most common biological functions using Inverted Repeats===
:This section is "under construction" and will be completed by mid-December.
--&gt;

===Regions where presence is obligatory===
Terminal inverted repeats have been observed in the DNA of various eukaryotic transposons, even though their source remains unknown.&lt;ref name=Zhang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=HH|author2=Xu, HE |author3=Shen, YH |author4=Han, MJ |author5= Zhang, Z |title=The Origin and Evolution of Six Miniature Inverted-Repeat Transposable Elements in Bombyx mori and Rhodnius prolixus|journal=Genome Biology and Evolution|date=January 2013|volume=5|issue=11|pages=2020–31|pmid=24115603|doi=10.1093/gbe/evt153 |pmc=3845634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inverted repeats are principally found at the origins of replication of cell organism and organelles that range from phage plasmids, mitochondria, and eukaryotic viruses to mammalian cells.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=CE|author2=Zorbas, H |author3=Price, GB |author4= Zannis-Hadjopoulos, M |title=Inverted repeats, stem-loops, and cruciforms: significance for initiation of DNA replication|journal=Journal of Cellular Biochemistry|date=October 1996|volume=63|issue=1|pages=1–22|pmid=8891900|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-4644(199610)63:1&lt;1::AID-JCB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-3|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cfcd248e8bdf589b422478244855dcb6dcec62a3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replication origins of the phage G4 and other related phages comprise a segment of nearly 139 nucleotide bases that include three inverted repeats that are essential for replication priming.&lt;ref name=Pearson /&gt;

===In the genome===
To a large extent, portions of nucleotide repeats are quite often observed as part of rare DNA combinations.&lt;ref name=Heringa /&gt; The three main repeats which are largely found in particular DNA constructs include the closely precise homopurine-homopyrimidine inverted repeats, which is otherwise referred to as H palindromes, a common occurrence in triple helical H conformations that may comprise either the TAT or CGC nucleotide triads. The others could be described as long inverted repeats having the tendency to produce hairpins and cruciform, and finally direct tandem repeats, which commonly exist in structures described as slipped-loop, cruciform and left-handed Z-DNA.&lt;ref name=Heringa /&gt;

===Common in different organisms===
Past studies suggest that repeats are a common feature of [[eukaryotes]] unlike the [[prokaryotes]] and [[archaea]].&lt;ref name=Heringa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heringa|first=J|title=Detection of internal repeats: how common are they?|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|date=June 1998|volume=8|issue=3|pages=338–45|pmid=9666330|doi=10.1016/S0959-440X(98)80068-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports suggest that irrespective of the comparative shortage of repeat elements in prokaryotic genomes, they nevertheless contain hundreds or even thousands of large repeats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Treangen|first=TJ|author2=Abraham, AL |author3=Touchon, M |author4= Rocha, EP |title=Genesis, effects and fates of repeats in prokaryotic genomes|journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews|date=May 2009|volume=33|issue=3|pages=539–71|pmid=19396957|doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2009.00169.x|url=https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article-pdf/33/3/539/18141891/33-3-539.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Current genomic analysis seem to suggest the existence of a large excess of perfect inverted repeats in many prokaryotic genomes as compared to eukaryotic genomes.&lt;ref name=Ladoukakis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ladoukakis|first=ED|author2=Eyre-Walker, A|title=The excess of small inverted repeats in prokaryotes|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution|date=September 2008|volume=67|issue=3|pages=291–300|pmid=18696026|doi=10.1007/s00239-008-9151-z|url=http://www.lifesci.susx.ac.uk/home/Adam_Eyre-Walker/Website/Publications_files/LadoukakisJME08.pdf|bibcode=2008JMolE..67..291L|citeseerx=10.1.1.578.7466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For quantification and comparison of inverted repeats between several species, namely on archaea, see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hosseini|first=M|author2=Pratas, D |author3=Pinho, AJ |title=On the Role of Inverted Repeats in DNA Sequence Similarity|journal=11th International Conference on Practical Applications of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics.

===Inverted repeats in pseudoknots===
[[Pseudoknot]]s are common structural motifs found in RNA.  They are formed by two nested [[stem-loop]]s such that the stem of one structure is formed from the loop of the other.  There are multiple folding [[topology|topologies]] among pseudoknots and great variation in loop lengths, making them a structurally diverse group.&lt;ref name=Staple&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staple|first=DW|author2=Butcher, SE|title=Pseudoknots: RNA structures with diverse functions.|journal=PLoS Biology|date=June 2005|volume=3|issue=6|pages=e213|pmid=15941360|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030213|pmc=1149493}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inverted repeats are a key component of pseudoknots as can be seen in the illustration of a naturally occurring pseudoknot found in the human [[telomerase RNA component]].&lt;ref name=chen-greider&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=JL|author2=Greider, CW|title=Functional analysis of the pseudoknot structure in human telomerase RNA.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Jun 7, 2005|volume=102|issue=23|pages=8080–5; discussion 8077–9|pmid=15849264|doi=10.1073/pnas.0502259102|pmc=1149427|bibcode=2005PNAS..102.8080C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four different sets of inverted repeats are involved in this structure.  Sets 1 and 2 are the stem of stem-loop A and are part of the loop for stem-loop B.  Similarly, sets 3 and 4 are the stem for stem-loop B and are part of the loop for stem-loop A.

Pseudoknots play a number of different roles in biology.  The telomerase pseudoknot in the illustration is critical to that enzyme's activity.&lt;ref name=chen-greider /&gt;  The [[ribozyme]] for the [[Hepatitis D|''hepatitis delta virus (HDV)'']] folds into a double-pseudoknot structure and self-cleaves its circular genome to produce a single-genome-length RNA.  Pseudoknots also play a role in programmed [[ribosomal frameshift]]ing found in some viruses and required in the replication of [[retroviruses]].&lt;ref name=Staple /&gt;{{Clear}}

===In riboswitches===
Inverted repeats play an important role in [[riboswitch]]es, which are RNA regulatory elements that control the expression of genes that produce the mRNA, of which they are part.&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt;  A simplified example of the [[flavin mononucleotide]] (FMN) riboswitch is shown in the illustration. This riboswitch exists in the [[mRNA]] transcript and has several [[stem-loop]] structures upstream from the [[coding region]].  However, only the key stem-loops are shown in the illustration, which has been greatly simplified to help show the role of the inverted repeats.  There are multiple inverted repeats in this riboswitch as indicated in green (yellow background) and blue (orange background). [[File:Ribo100r.gif|thumb|800 px|left]]
{{Clear}}
In the absence of FMN, the Anti-termination structure is the preferred [[Conformation activity relationship|conformation]] for the mRNA transcript. It is created by base-pairing of the inverted repeat region circled in red.  When FMN is present, it may bind to the loop and prevent formation of the Anti-termination structure.  This allows two different sets of inverted repeats to base-pair and form the Termination structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winkler|first=WC|author2=Cohen-Chalamish, S |author3=Breaker, RR |title=An mRNA structure that controls gene expression by binding FMN.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Dec 10, 2002|volume=99|issue=25|pages=15908–13|pmid=12456892|doi=10.1073/pnas.212628899|pmc=138538|bibcode=2002PNAS...9915908W}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stem-loop on the 3' end is a [[Terminator (genetics)|transcriptional terminator]] because the sequence immediately following it is a string of uracils (U).  If this stem-loop forms (due to the presence of FMN) as the growing RNA strand emerges from the [[RNA polymerase]] complex, it will create enough structural tension to cause the RNA strand to dissociate and thus terminate transcription.  The dissociation occurs easily because the base-pairing between the U's in the RNA and the A's in the template strand are the weakest of all base-pairings.&lt;ref name=Watson /&gt;  Thus, at higher concentration levels, FMN down-regulates its own transcription by increasing the formation of the termination structure.

==Mutations and disease==
Inverted repeats are often described as "hotspots" of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomic instability.&lt;ref name=Voineagu&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirkin|first=I|author2=Narayanan, V |author3=Lobachev, KS |author4= Mirkin, SM |title=Replication stalling at unstable inverted repeats: interplay between DNA hairpins and fork stabilizing proteins|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Jul 22, 2008|volume=105|issue=29|pages=9936–41|pmid=18632578|bibcode=2008PNAS..105.9936V|doi=10.1073/pnas.0804510105|pmc=2481305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long inverted repeats are deemed to greatly influence the stability of the genome of various organisms.&lt;ref name=Zhao&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stormo|first=G|author2=Chang, KY |author3=Varley, K |author4= Stormo, GD |title=Evidence for active maintenance of inverted repeat structures identified by a comparative genomic approach|journal=PLoS ONE|date=Feb 28, 2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=e262|pmid=17327921|bibcode=2007PLoSO...2..262Z|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000262|pmc=1803023|editor1-last=Hall|editor1-first=Neil}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is exemplified in ''E. coli'', where genomic sequences with long inverted repeats are seldom replicated, but rather deleted with rapidity.&lt;ref name=Zhao /&gt; Again, the long inverted repeats observed in yeast greatly favor recombination within the same and adjacent chromosomes, resulting in an equally very high rate of deletion.&lt;ref name=Zhao /&gt; Finally, a very high rate of deletion and recombination were also observed in mammalian chromosomes regions with inverted repeats.&lt;ref name=Zhao /&gt; Reported differences in the stability of genomes of interrelated organisms are always an indication of a disparity in inverted repeats.&lt;ref name=Achaz /&gt; The instability results from the tendency of inverted repeats to fold into hairpin- or cruciform-like DNA structures. These special structures can hinder or confuse DNA replication and other genomic activities.&lt;ref name=Voineagu /&gt; Thus, inverted repeats lead to special configurations in both [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] that can ultimately cause [[mutation]]s and [[disease]].&lt;ref name=bissler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bissler|first=JJ|title=DNA inverted repeats and human disease|journal=Frontiers in Bioscience|date=Mar 27, 1998|volume=3|issue=4|pages=d408–18|pmid=9516381|doi=10.2741/a284|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b2dec34e8282e46e9285e5f3f09bc9313cb0d804}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:DNA palindrome.svg|thumb|600 px|left|Inverted repeat changing to/from an extruded cruciform. &amp;nbsp; A: Inverted Repeat Sequences; &amp;nbsp; B: Loop; &amp;nbsp; C: Stem with base pairing of the inverted repeat sequences]]
The illustration shows an inverted repeat undergoing cruciform extrusion. DNA in the region of the inverted repeat unwinds and then recombines, forming a four-way junction with two [[stem-loop]] structures. The cruciform structure occurs because the inverted repeat sequences self-pair to each other on their own strand.&lt;ref name=ramreddy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramreddy|first=T|author2=Sachidanandam, R |author3=Strick, TR |title=Real-time detection of cruciform extrusion by single-molecule DNA nanomanipulation|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=May 2011|volume=39|issue=10|pages=4275–83|pmid=21266478|doi=10.1093/nar/gkr008|pmc=3105387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extruded cruciforms can lead to [[frameshift mutation]]s when a DNA sequence has inverted repeats in the form of a [[palindromic sequence|palindrome]] combined with regions of [[direct repeat]]s on either side. During [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]], slippage and partial dissociation of the polymerase from the template strand can lead to both [[deletion (genetics)|deletion]] and [[insertion (genetics)|insertion]] mutations.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;  Deletion occurs when a portion of the unwound [[template strand]] forms a stem-loop that gets "skipped" by the transcription machinery. Insertion occurs when a stem-loop forms in a dissociated portion of the nascent (newly synthesized) strand causing a portion of the template strand to be transcribed twice.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;

=== Antithrombin deficiency from a point mutation ===
Imperfect inverted repeats can lead to [[mutation]]s through intrastrand and interstrand switching.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;  The [[antithrombin]] III gene's coding region is an example of an imperfect inverted repeat as shown in the figure on the right.
The [[stem-loop]] structure forms with a bump at the bottom because the G and T do not pair up. A strand switch event could result in the G (in the bump) being replaced by an A which removes the "imperfection" in the inverted repeat and provides a stronger stem-loop structure. However, the replacement also creates a [[point mutation]] converting the GCA codon to ACA. If the strand switch event is followed by a second round of [[DNA replication]], the mutation may become fixed in the [[genome]] and lead to disease. Specifically, the [[missense mutation]] would lead to a defective gene and a deficiency in antithrombin which could result in the development of [[venous thromboembolism]] (blood clots within a vein).&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;

=== Osteogenesis imperfecta from a frameshift mutation ===
Mutations in the [[collagen]] gene can lead to the disease [[Osteogenesis Imperfecta]], which is characterized by brittle bones.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt; In the illustration, a stem-loop formed from an imperfect inverted repeat is mutated with a thymine (T) nucleotide insertion as a result of an inter- or intrastrand switch. The addition of the T creates a [[base-pairing]] "match up" with the adenine (A) that was previously a "bump" on the left side of the stem. While this addition makes the stem stronger and perfects the inverted repeat, it also creates a [[frameshift mutation]] in the nucleotide sequence which alters the [[reading frame]] and will result in an incorrect expression of the gene.&lt;ref name=bissler /&gt;

'''Parabiosis''', meaning "living beside", is a technical term in various contexts in fields of study related to [[ecology]] and [[physiology]]. It accordingly has been defined independently in at least three disciplines, namely experimental or medical physiology, the ecology of inactive physiological states, and the ecology of certain classes of social species that share nests.

==Etymology==
Parabiosis derives most directly from [[new Latin]],&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parabiosis?show=0&amp;t=1386697129]&lt;/ref&gt; but the Latin in turn derives from two classical Greek roots. The first is ''παρά'' (''para'') for "beside" or "next to". In modern etymology, this root appears in various senses, such as "close to", "outside of", and "different".

* In the physiological sense of "parabiosis", "para" apparently was intended to mean "next to".
* In describing transiently inactive physiological states, "para" apparently meant "outside of".
* In ecological usage, the word was coined by the entomologist [[Auguste-Henri Forel]] as an analogue to "[[symbiosis]]", also in the sense of "next to". However, in this case, the emphasis was in contrast to "together" ("sym-").

The second classical Greek root from which the Latin derives is ''βίος'' (''bios''), meaning "life".

==Parabiotic experiments==
[[File:The Biological bulletin (19755290053).jpg|thumb|Left: A headless [[Cecropia Moth]] joined with a pupa of the [[polyphemus moth|Polyphemus silkworm]]. Right: The abdomen of a Cecropia moth joined with a Cecropia pupa]]
In the field of experimental physiology, parabiosis is a class of techniques in which two living organisms are joined together surgically and develop single, shared physiological systems, such as a shared circulatory system.&lt;ref&gt;Biju Parekkadan &amp; Martin L. Yarmush (eds). Stem Cell Bioengineering. Chapter 10: "Parabiosis in aging research and regenerative medicine" Artech House 2009 {{ISBN|978-1596934023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zarrow, M. X.  Experimental Endocrinology: A Sourcebook of Basic Techniques Academic Press 1964 {{ISBN|978-0124143609}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through surgically connecting two animals, researchers can prove that the feedback system in one animal is circulated and affects the second animal via blood and plasma exchange. Total blood volume is exchanged approximately ten times per day in rat experiments using parabiosis. One limitation of the experiments is that [[outbreed|outbred]] rats cannot be used because it can lead to a significant loss of pairs due to intoxication of the blood supply from a dissimilar rat.&lt;ref name="Harris, R. B. S. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = R. B. S. | year = 2013 | title = Is Leptin the Parabiotic "Satiety" Factor ? Past and Present Interpretations | url = | journal = Appetite | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 111–118 | doi = 10.1016/j.appet.2012.08.006 | pmc = 3749919 | pmid=22889986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1800s, parabiotic experiments were pioneered by [[Paul Bert]]. He postulated that surgically connected animals could share a circulatory system. Bert was awarded the Prize of Experimental Physiology of the French Academy of Science in 1866 for his discoveries. Parabiotic experiments were scarcely revisited until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Eggel, A. 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eggel | first1 = A. | last2 = Wyss-Coray | first2 = T. | year = 2014 | title = Parabiosis for the study of age-related chronic disease | url = | journal = Swiss Medical Weekly | volume = 144 | issue = | page = 13914 | doi = 10.4414/smw.2014.13914|pmid=24496774|pmc=4082987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the parabiotic experiments since 1950 involve research regarding metabolism. One of these experiments was published in 1959 by G. R. Hervey in the ''[[The Journal of Physiology|Journal of Physiology]]''. This experiment was to support the theory that damage to the [[hypothalamus]], particularly the ventromedial hypothalamus, leads to obesity caused by the overconsumption of food. This results from the ventromedial hypothalamus failing to respond to physiological signals that suppress appetite. The result is attributed to the feedback control system in the brain. Rats in the study were from the same litter, which had been a closed colony for multiple years. The two rats in each pair had no more than 3% difference in weight. Rats were paired at four weeks old. Unpaired rats were used as controls. The rats were conjoined in three ways. In early experiments, the peritoneal cavities were opened and connected between the two rats. In later experiments, to avoid the risk of tangling the two rats’ intestines together, smaller cuts were made. After further refinement of the experimental procedure, the abdominal cavities were not opened and the rats were conjoined at the hip bone with minimal cutting. In order to prove that the two animals were sharing blood, researchers injected dye into the veins of one rat and the pigment would show up in the conjoined rat. The scientists refined the lesion placement by practicing the procedure on other rats. The rats were killed with ether and weighed at the conclusion of the experiment and the amount of fat in each animal was quantified.

Many of the parabiotic pairs died throughout the experiment before its conclusion. In each pair, one rat became obese and exhibited hyperphagia. The weight of the rat with the surgical lesion rose rapidly for a few months, then reached a plateau as a direct result of the surgical procedure. After the procedure, the rat with the impaired hypothalamus voraciously ate and the paired rat decreased their appetite. The paired rat became obviously thin throughout the experiment, even rejecting food when it was offered. Some of the paired rats starved to death. Lesions subsequently made in the hypothalamus of two paired rats resulted in hyperphagia and obesity. That result verifies that the paired rat decreased its eating in a direct response to the signals in the blood from the rat with the lesion. If its brain was similarly altered, it also ate voraciously and became obese. The control rats who were given surgical lesions in the hypothalamus became similarly obese to the parabiotic counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hervey | first1 = G. R. | year = 1959 | title = The effects of lesions in the hypothalamus in parabiotic rats | url = | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 145 | issue = 2| pages = 336–352 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1959.sp006145| pmc = 1356830 | pmid=13642304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later studies linked the effects of the previous parabiotic experiments about metabolism to the discovery of [[leptin]]. Many hormones and metabolites were proven to not be the satiety factor that caused one rat to starve in the experiments. Leptin seemed like a viable candidate. Starting in 1977, Ruth B.S. Harris, a graduate student under Hervey, repeated previous studies about parabiosis in rats and mice. Due to the discovery of leptin, she analyzed leptin concentrations of the mice in the parabiotic experiments. After injecting leptin into the obese mouse of each pair, she found that leptin circulated between the conjoined animals, but the circulation of leptin took some time to reach equilibrium. As a result of the injections, almost immediate weight loss resulted in the parabiotic pairs due to increased inhibition. Approximately 50–70% of fat was lost in the pairs. The obese mouse lost only fat. The lean mouse lost muscle mass and fat. Harris concluded that leptin levels are increased in the obese animal, but other factors could also affect the animals. Also, leptin was determined to decrease fat storage in both the obese and thin animals.&lt;ref name="Harris, R. B. S. 2013"/&gt;

Parabiotic experiments have also been used to study diabetes. Douglas Coleman did further parabiotic experiments to determine diabetic chromosomal relationships. A major gene that causes obesity in mice was identified on chromosome 6. The obese gene (ob/ob) was determined from one mutant mouse, discovered in 1950. Coleman and researchers further identified a gene on chromosome 4 that led to hyperphagia and obesity in mice. The gene also correlated to the severe onset of diabetes (db/db gene). The experimenters used parabiosis to conjoin a db/db mouse to a normal mouse, and the normal mouse would starve to death after one week. The db/db mouse would still have a high blood sugar and food in its system. The db/db mouse was determined to have a satiety factor so potent that the other mouse would starve to death. A db/db mouse was conjoined with an ob/ob mouse and the result was the same as the first experiment. The obese mouse starved in 20–30 days, similar to the thin counterpart in the first experiment. The db/db mutant mouse overproduced a satiety factor but could not respond to it, perhaps due to a defective receptor, whereas the ob/ob mutant recognized and responded to the factor but could not reproduce it. Further studies with db/db mice with lesions in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus suggested that the receptor for the satiety factor was found in these brain receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coleman | first1 = D | year = 2010 | title = A historical perspective on leptin | url = | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 10| pages = 1097–1099 | doi=10.1038/nm1010-1097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early parabiotic experiments also included cancer research. One study, published in 1966 by Friedell, studied the effects of radiation with X-rays on ovarian tumors. To study the tumors, two adult female rats were conjoined. The left rat was shielded and the right rat was exposed to high levels of radiation. The rats were given a controlled amount of food and water for the remainder of their natural lives. After death, the rats were autopsied and 149 of 328 pairs showed the presence of possible ovarian tumors in one or both of the two animals. This result matched previous studies of single rats. Since Friedell’s experiment, other parabiotic experiments have been useful in researching many types of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friedell | first1 = G. H. | last2 = Sommers | first2 = S. C. | last3 = Chute | first3 = R. N. | last4 = Warren | first4 = S. | year = 1966 | title = Ovarian tumorigenesis in irradiated parabiotic rats | url = | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 427–434 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic diseases of age have been saluted as prime candidates for parabiotic research because of the potential to conjoin an older animal with a younger animal. This process could be used to research cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and Alzheimer’s disease. As animals age, their [[oligodendrocyte]]s reduce in efficiency, resulting in decreased myelination, causing negative effects on the [[central nervous system]] (CNS). Julia Ruckh and fellow researchers have used parabiosis to study [[remyelination]] from adult stem cells to see if conjoining young with older mice could reverse or delay this process. In the experiment, the two mice were conjoined and demyelination was induced via injection into the older mice. The experiment determined that factors from the younger mice reversed CNS demyelination in older mice by revitalizing the oligodendrocytes. The [[monocyte]]s from the younger mice also enhanced the ability of the older mice to clear myelin debris because the young monocytes can clear lipids from myelin sheaths more effectively than older monocytes. The conjoining of the two animals reversed the effects of age on the myelination cells. The ability of the young mouse’s cells was unaffected. Enhanced immunity from the younger mouse also promoted the general health of the older mouse in each pair. The results of this experiment could lead to therapy processes for people with demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruckh | first1 = Julia M. | last2 = Zhao | first2 = Jing-Wei | last3 = Shadrach | first3 = Jennifer L. | last4 = Peter | last5 = Nageswara Rao | first5 = Tata | last6 = Wagers | first6 = Amy J. | last7 = Franklin | first7 = Robin J.M. | year = 2012 | title = Rejuvenation of Regeneration in the Aging Central Nervous System | url = | journal = Cell Stem Cell | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 96–103 | doi=10.1016/j.stem.2011.11.019| pmc = 3714794 | pmid=22226359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parabiotic research can be controversial. Due to accusations of animal cruelty, the practice is now shunned in many countries. Compared to other research techniques, there are relatively few parabiotic experiments. Some scientists argue for the benefits of parabiotic research. Eggel and Wyss-Coray argue that conjoining animals mimics naturally occurring parabiosis in nature due to the shared blood supply of conjoined twins. The experiments give insight into the way that bodily systems circulate, which has led to many advances in the study of a variety of diseases. Parabiotic experiments have been used to study obesity, chronic diseases of age, stem cell research, tissue regeneration, diabetes, transplants, tumor biology, and endocrinology.&lt;ref name="Eggel, A. 2014"/&gt; Wyss-Coray has also conducted research into [[young blood transfusion]], the donation of blood from a young donor to an older recipient.

==Parabiosis in physiology==
Other than in experimental physiology, the term also is applicable to spontaneously occurring conditions such as in conjoined twins.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

Logically the word parabiosis would be equally applicable to various forms of parasitism such as the [[obligate]] parasitic reproduction of [[Anglerfish]] of the family [[Ceratiidae]], in which the circulatory systems of the males and females unite completely. Without the attachment of males to a female, the endocrine functions cannot mature, the individuals fail to develop properly and die young and without reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, Klaus. Marine Parasitology. CSIRO Publishing 2005. {{ISBN|978-0643090255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in plants growing closely together roots or stems in intimate contact sometimes form natural grafts. More commonly, in parasitic plants such as [[mistletoe]] and [[dodder]] the [[haustorium|haustoria]] unite the circulatory systems of the host and the parasite so intimately that parasitic twiners such as ''[[Cassytha#Reproduction and ecology|Cassytha]]'' may act as vectors carrying disease organisms from one host plant to another.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, Alan R., Coile, Nancy C., Schubert. Timothy S.; "Comparison of Two Parasitic Vines: Dodder (Cuscuta) and Woe Vine (Cassytha)". Botany Circular No. 30. Fla. Dept Agric. &amp; Consumer Services January/February 1996. Division of Plant Industry&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inactive physiological states==
Parabiosis as a term also applies to the states assumed by many organisms in various [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of life, such as some bacteria, the bear animalcules ([[Tardigrade|Tardigrada]]), and [[Rotifer]]a. At least some members of all these [[Taxon|taxa]] can survive drying out, often for decades or longer. Some bacteria, such as those causing [[anthrax]], produce inactive, resistant spores that survive underground for many years. The eggs of some animals, such as [[Anostraca]], the brine shrimps and their close relatives, have resistant shells and can survive in seasonally dried-out pools. In such a state the organisms show no sign of life until suitable conditions return. In this sense the ''para'' root apparently refers to the state as being "outside" of life.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

==Ecology of social organisms sharing nests==
[[File:Shattuck 53813, Crematogaster modiglianii and Camponotus rufifemur parabiosis, Danum Valley, Sabah-web (5042353719) (2).jpg|thumb|''[[Crematogaster]] modiglianii'' and ''[[Camponotus]] rufifemur'' ants sharing a nest]]
In the late 19th century the first examples were discovered, of colonies of ants that more or less routinely shared their nests with essentially unrelated species of ants. They did not obviously share anything beyond the upkeep of the nests, even segregating their brood, so these were very surprising observations; most ants are radically intolerant of intruders, usually including even intruders of their own species.

In the early 20th century [[Auguste-Henri Forel]] coined the term "parabiosis" for such associations, and it was adopted by the likes of [[William Morton Wheeler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wheeler | first1 = William Morton | year = 1921 | title = A New Case of Parabiosis and the "Ant Gardens" of British Guiana | journal = Ecology | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 89–103 | jstor=1928921 | doi=10.2307/1928921| url = https://zenodo.org/record/25181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has remained in currency, for example: "Parabiosis is defined as a special symbiosis, so far known only from a few Neotropical ant species, in which two or more species occupy the same nest site and forage together while keeping brood separate".&lt;ref name=Swain&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swain | first1 = R. B. | year = 1980 | title = Trophic competition among parabiotic ants | url = | journal = Insectes Sociaux | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 377–390 | doi = 10.1007/BF02223730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is to be expected in matters concerning [[ethology]] and [[ecology]] however, such a class of behaviour patterns cannot be distinguished puristically from every other; there are exceptions and differences of kind and degree. Parabiosis ranges from the sharing of common trails to sharing common nests, and from effectively tolerating another species in general, to toleration only of the single colony of that species that shares the same nest. Furthermore, there is evidence for the partitioning of functions and unequal sharing of work between the two species in the nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Menzel | first1 = Florian | last2 = Linsenmair | first2 = Karl Eduard | last3 = Blüthgen | first3 = Nico | year = 2008 | title = Selective interspecific tolerance in tropical Crematogaster–Camponotus associations | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 75 | issue = 3| pages = 837–846 | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.07.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early reports that parabiotic ant colonies forage and feed together peacefully also have been qualified by observations that revealed ants of one species in such an association aggressively displacing members of the other species from artificially provided food, while also profiting by following their recruitment trails to new food sources.&lt;ref name=Swain/&gt;

In practice parabiosis hardly could be a purely neutral interaction. There can be consequent benefits from shared nest defence and maintenance even when there is neither direct cooperation nor inimical interaction between the two associated populations in a nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Menzel | first1 = F. | last2 = Blüthgen | first2 = N. | year = 2010 | title = Parabiotic associations between tropical ants: equal partnership or parasitic exploitation? | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 79 | issue = 1| pages = 71–81 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2656.2009.01628.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FSCV in combination with [[Carbon (fiber)|carbon-fiber]] microelectrodes became a very popular method for detection of [[neurotransmitters]], [[hormones]] and [[metabolites]] in biological systems.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wightman |first=R. M. |year=2006 |title=Probing Cellular Chemistry in Biological Systems with Microelectrodes |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=311 |issue=5767 |pages=1570–1574 |doi=10.1126/science.1120027 |pmid=16543451 |bibcode=2006Sci...311.1570W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, FSCV was successfully used for detection of electrochemically active [[biogenic amines]] release in [[chromaffin cells]] ([[adrenaline]] and [[noradrenaline]]), [[Slice preparation|brain slices]] ([[Serotonin|5-HT]], [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]]) and [[in vivo]] in [[anesthetized]] or awake and behaving animals ([[dopamine]]). Further refinements of the method have enabled detection of [[5-HT]], [[norepinephrine]], [[adenosine]], [[oxygen]], [[pH]] changes [[in vivo]] in [[rat]]s and [[Mouse|mice]] as well as measurement of dopamine and serotonin concentration in [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]].

== Principles of FSCV ==
In fast-scan cyclic [[voltammetry]] (FSCV), a small [[Carbon fibers|carbon fiber]] [[electrode]] (micrometer scale) is inserted into living cells, tissue, or [[Extracellular|extracellular space]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Robinson DL, Venton BJ, Heien ML, Wightman RM. Detecting subsecond dopamine release with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in vivo. Clin Chem. 2003 Oct;49(10):1763-73. Review. {{PMID|14500617}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The electrode is then used to quickly raise and lower the voltage in a triangular wave fashion.  When the voltage is in the correct range (typically ±1 Volt) the compound of interest will be repeatedly oxidized and reduced.  This will result in a movement of electrons in solution that will ultimately create a small alternating current (nano amps scale).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wassum KM, Phillips PE. Probing the neurochemical correlates of motivation and decision making. ACS Chem Neurosci. 2015 Jan 21;6(1):11-3. {{doi|10.1021/cn500322y}}. Epub 2014 Dec 19. Review. {{PMID|25526380}}; {{PMC|4304500}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  By subtracting the background current created by the probe from the resulting current, it is possible to generate a voltage vs. current plot that is unique to each compound.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David O. |last1=Wipf |first2=Eric W. |last2=Kristensen |first3=Mark R. |last3=Deakin |first4=R. Mark |last4=Wightman |title=Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry as a method to measure rapid heterogeneous electron-transfer kinetics |journal=Analytical Chemistry |date=1988 |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=306–310 |doi=10.1021/ac00155a006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the time scale of the voltage oscillations is known, this can then be used to calculate a plot of the current in solution as a function of time.  The relative concentrations of the compound may be calculated as long as the number of electrons transferred in each oxidation and reduction reaction is known.

Advantages such as chemical specificity, high resolution, and noninvasive probes make FSCV a powerful technique for detecting changing chemical concentrations in vivo.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The chemical specificity of FSCV is derived from [[reduction potential]]s.  Every compound has a unique reduction potential, and so the alternating voltage can be set to select for a particular compound.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  As a result, FSCV can be used to measure a variety of electrically active biological compounds such as catacholamines, [[indolamines]], and  [[neurotransmitter]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Concentration changes regarding [[ascorbic acid]], [[oxygen]], [[nitric oxide]], and hydrogen ions ([[pH]]) can also be detected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It can even be used to measure multiple compounds at the same time, as long as one has a positive and the other has a negative [[Reduction potential|redox potential]].   High resolution is achieved by changing the voltage at very high speeds, referred to as a fast scan rate.  Scan rates for FSCV are on the sub-second scale, oxidizing and reducing compounds in microseconds.  Another advantage of FSCV is its ability to be used in vivo.  Typical electrodes consist of small carbon fiber needles that are micrometers in diameter and able to be noninvasively inserted into live tissues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The size of the electrode also permits it to probe very specific brain regions.  Thus, FSCV has proved to be effective in measuring chemical fluctuations of living organisms and has been used in conjunction with several behavioral studies.

Acceptable voltage and current ranges are common limitations of FSCV.  To start, the electric potential must stay within the voltage range of the [[electrolysis of water]] (Eo = ± 1.23).  Additionally, the resulting current must remain low in order to avoid [[Lysis|cell lysis]] as well as cell [[depolarization]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Fast scan cyclic voltammetry is also limited in that it only makes differential measurements; the currents it measures are only relative to the background, so they cannot be used to quantify resting concentrations.  This is partially due to the fact that the basal current levels are largely affected by factors such as pH, so over longer periods of time these values tend to drift.  The age of the electrode is also important, and probes tend to be less accurate the longer they are used.

This technique is also limited to quantifying the concentrations of electrically active compounds, and can only be used with select molecules in biological systems.  In spite of this, there have been methods developed to measure levels of non-electric [[enzyme]]s that have an electroactive [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  However, in this scenario, the electrode probes are also a limiting factor in the data resolution.  When measuring an electroactive substrate, the probe is often coated with its corresponding enzyme.  In order to avoid the enzyme interacting with different substrates, the electrode is also coated with a [[polymer]] that acts as a selective filter against particular types of ions.  However, when this polymer is added it lowers the speed at which the voltage scans can be made and effectively lowers the data resolution.

== Applications ==

=== Measurement of dopamine in vivo ===
FSCV is used to monitor changes in concentration of dopamine in mammalian brain in real time with sensitivity down to 1 nM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=DL |last2=Venton |first2=BJ |last3=Heien |first3=ML |last4=Wightman |first4=RM |title=Detecting subsecond dopamine release with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in vivo. |journal=Clinical Chemistry |date=October 2003 |volume=49 |issue=10 |pages=1763–73 |doi=10.1373/49.10.1763 |pmid=14500617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an acquisition rate of 10&amp;nbsp;Hz is fast enough to sample dynamics of neurotransmitter release and clearance. Pharmacological action of dopaminergic drugs such as [[Dopamine receptor D1|D1]] and [[Dopamine receptor D2|D2]] receptors [[Dopamine agonist|agonists]] and [[Dopamine receptor antagonist|antagonist]] ([[raclopride]], [[haloperidol]]), [[dopamine transporter]] [[Dopamine reuptake inhibitor|blockers]] ([[cocaine]], [[nomifensine]], [[GBR 12909]]) could be evaluated with FSCV. The fast acquisition rate also allows the study of dopamine dynamics during behavior.

The effects of [[psychostimulants]] (cocaine, [[amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]]), [[opioids]] ([[morphine]] and [[heroin]]), [[cannabinoids]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[nicotine]] on [[dopaminergic]] neurotransmission and development of drug addiction was studied with FSCV.

Dopamine is a primary neurotransmitter mediating learning, goal-directing behavior and decision making. Monitoring of dopamine concentration in vivo in behaving animals with FSCV reveals dopamine coding of the brain's decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Measurement of other monoamine neurotransmitters ===
FSCV is used to study dynamics of [[exocytosis]] of noradrenaline and adrenaline from chromaffin cells; release of [[serotonin]] from [[mast cells]]; release of 5-HT in brain slices; release of 5-HT in brain of anesthetized rodents and fruit flies; release of norepinephrine in brain of anesthetized and freely moving rodents.

      <text bytes="2549" xml:space="preserve">The '''universality–diversity paradigm''' is the analysis of biological materials based on the universality and diversity of its fundamental structural elements and functional mechanisms. The analysis of biological systems based on this classification has been a cornerstone of modern [[biology]].

For example, [[protein]]s constitute the elementary building blocks of a vast variety of biological materials such as cells, spider silk or bone, where they create extremely robust, multi-functional materials by self-organization of structures over many length- and time scales, from nano to macro. Some of the structural features are commonly found in many different tissues, that is, they are highly conserved. Examples of such universal building blocks include alpha-helices, beta-sheets or tropocollagen molecules. In contrast, other features are highly specific to tissue types, such as particular
filament assemblies, beta-sheet nanocrystals in spider silk or tendon fascicles. This coexistence of universality and diversity—referred to as the universality–diversity paradigm (UDP)—is an overarching feature in biological materials and a crucial component of [[materiomics]]. It might provide guidelines for bioinspired and biomimetic material development, where this concept is translated into the use of inorganic or hybrid organic-inorganic building blocks.

'''Biology''' is the [[natural science]] that studies [[life]] and living [[organism]]s, including their [[anatomy|physical structure]], [[Biochemistry|chemical processes]], [[Molecular biology|molecular interactions]], [[Physiology|physiological mechanisms]], [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=aquarenagloss&gt;Based on definition from: {{cite web |url=http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608113114/http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |archivedate=2004-06-08 |title=Aquarena Wetlands Project glossary of terms |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |publisher=Texas State University at San Marcos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the complexity of the science, there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it into a single, coherent field.

==Etymology==
Biology derives from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] words of βίος; [[romanized]] bíos meaning "life" and -λογία; romanized logía (-logy) meaning "branch of study" or "to speak". Those combined make the Greek word βιολογία; romanized biología meaning biology. Despite this, the term βιολογία as a whole didn't exist in Ancient Greek. The first to borrow it was the English and French (''biologie''). Since the advent of the scientific era, [[surface analysis|reanalyzable]] as a compound using the combining forms bio + logy. {{Clarification needed|reason=|date=October 2019}}

[[File:Tree of life by Haeckel.jpg|thumb|alt=Ernst Haeckel's pedigree of Man family tree from Evolution of Man|[[Ernst Haeckel]]'s Tree of Life (1879)]]

The term ''[[wikt:biology|biology]]'' is derived from the [[Greek Language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|[[wikt:βίος|βίος]]}}, ''vios'', "[[life]]" and the suffix {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''-logia'', "study of."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://topics.info.com/Who-coined-the-term-biology_716 |title=Who coined the term biology? |work=Info.com |accessdate=2012-06-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509211839/http://topics.info.com/Who-coined-the-term-biology_716 |archivedate=2013-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OnlineEtDict&gt;{{cite web | title=biology | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=biology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307163258/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=biology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 | archivedate=2013-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin-language form of the term first appeared in 1736 when Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] (Carl von Linné) used ''biologi'' in his ''[[Bibliotheca Botanica]]''. It was used again in 1766 in a work entitled ''Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae: tomus III, continens geologian, biologian, phytologian generalis'', by [[Michael Christoph Hanow|Michael Christoph Hanov]], a disciple of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. The first German use, ''Biologie'', was in a 1771 translation of Linnaeus' work. In 1797, Theodor Georg August Roose used the term in the preface of a book, ''Grundzüge der Lehre van der Lebenskraft''. [[Karl Friedrich Burdach]] used the term in 1800 in a more restricted sense of the study of human beings from a morphological, physiological and psychological perspective (''Propädeutik zum Studien der gesammten Heilkunst''). The term came into its modern usage with the six-volume treatise ''Biologie, oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur'' (1802–22) by [[Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus]], who announced:&lt;ref name=Richards&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Robert J. |title=The Romantic Conception of Life: Science and Philosophy in the Age of Goethe|year=2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press | isbn= 978-0-226-71210-9 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=X7N4_i7vrTUC&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The objects of our research will be the different forms and manifestations of life, the conditions and laws under which these phenomena occur, and the causes through which they have been effected. The science that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name biology [Biologie] or the doctrine of life [Lebenslehre].

Although modern biology is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. [[Natural philosophy]] was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], and [[China]]. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Magner|first=Lois N.|title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC|year=2002|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-91100-6|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324125937/http://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC|archivedate=2015-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Anthony | last=Serafini |title=The Epic History of Biology |date=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z3oECAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;q=biology%20egypt|accessdate=14 July 2015| isbn=978-1-4899-6327-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the formal study of [[medicine]] dates back to [[Pharaonic Egypt]], it was [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his ''[[History of Animals]]'' and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the [[Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote a series of books on [[botany]] that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Theophrastus|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars of the [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|medieval Islamic world]] who wrote on biology included [[al-Jahiz]] (781–869), [[Al-Dīnawarī]] (828–896), who wrote on botany,&lt;ref name="Fahd-815"&gt;{{cite book | last=Fahd | first=Toufic |contribution=Botany and agriculture|page=815|ref=harv|editor-last1=Morelon |editor-first1=Régis |editor-last2=Rashed |editor-first2=Roshdi |year=1996 |title=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science |volume=3 |publisher=[[Routledge]] | isbn=978-0-415-12410-2| title-link=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi|Rhazes]] (865–925) who wrote on [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. [[Medicine]] was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life.

Biology began to quickly develop and grow with [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]]'s dramatic improvement of the [[microscope]]. It was then that scholars discovered [[spermatozoa]], [[bacteria]], [[infusoria]] and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by [[Jan Swammerdam]] led to new interest in [[entomology]] and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic [[dissection]] and [[staining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Magner |first=Lois N. |title=A History of the Life Sciences, Revised and Expanded |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-203-91100-6 |pages=133–44 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324125937/http://books.google.com/books?id=YKJ6gVYbrGwC |archivedate=2015-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[microscopy]] also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the [[cell (biology)|cell]]. Then, in 1838, [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden|Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann|Schwann]] began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of [[life]], although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of [[Robert Remak]] and [[Rudolf Virchow]], however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as [[cell theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jan | last=Sapp | authorlink=Jan Sapp | year=2003 | title=Genesis: The Evolution of Biology | chapter=7 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York. | isbn=978-0-19-515618-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Coleman | first=William  | year=1977 | title=Biology in the Nineteenth Century: Problems of Form, Function, and Transformation | chapter=| publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=New York | isbn=978-0-521-29293-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. [[Carl Linnaeus]] published a basic [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]], treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of [[common descent]]. Although he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the [[history of evolutionary thought]]; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both [[Lamarck]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], who was the first to present a coherent theory of evolution.&lt;ref name="Gould 2002 187"&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould|Gould, Stephen Jay]]. ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory''. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press: Cambridge, 2002. {{ISBN|0-674-00613-5}}. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; He posited that evolution was the result of environmental stress on properties of animals, meaning that the more frequently and rigorously an organ was used, the more complex and efficient it would become, thus adapting the animal to its environment. Lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then be passed on to the animal's offspring, who would further develop and perfect them.&lt;ref name=Lam1914&gt;[[#Lamarck1914|Lamarck (1914)]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the British naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], combining the biogeographical approach of [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]], the uniformitarian geology of [[Charles Lyell|Lyell]], [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus's]] writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, who forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on [[natural selection]]; similar reasoning and evidence led [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] to independently reach the same conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst. ''The Growth of Biological Thought'', chapter 10: "Darwin's evidence for evolution and common descent"; and chapter 11: "The causation of evolution: natural selection"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward J. |title=Evolution: The Remarkable History of a Scientific Theory |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzLRvxlJhzkC |year=2006 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-58836-538-5 |chapter=Ch. 3 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324124009/http://books.google.com/books?id=xzLRvxlJhzkC |archivedate=2015-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was the subject of [[Creation–evolution controversy|controversy]] (which continues to this day), Darwin's theory quickly spread through the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology.

The discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and [[population genetics]]. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to [[DNA]] as the component of [[chromosomes]] that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as [[genes]]. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as [[viruses]] and [[bacteria]], along with the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of [[molecular genetics]]. From the 1950s to the present times, biology has been vastly extended in the [[Molecular Biology|molecular]] domain. The [[genetic code]] was cracked by [[Har Gobind Khorana]], [[Robert W. Holley]] and [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg]] after DNA was understood to contain [[codons]]. Finally, the [[Human Genome Project]] was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human [[genome]]. This project was essentially completed in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2940601.stm | title=Human genome finally complete | accessdate=2006-07-22 | date=2003-04-14 | work=BBC News | first=Ivan | last=Noble | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614141605/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2940601.stm | archivedate=2006-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.

==Foundations of modern biology==

===Cell theory===

{{Main|Cell theory}}

Cell theory states that the [[cell (biology)|cell]] is the fundamental unit of [[life]], that all living things are composed of one or more cells, and that all cells arise from pre-existing cells through [[cell division]]. In [[multicellular organisms]], every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a [[zygote|single cell]] in a fertilized [[egg (biology)|egg]]. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Mazzarello, P | title=A unifying concept: the history of cell theory | journal=Nature Cell Biology | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=E13–15 | date=May 1999 | pmid=10559875 | doi=10.1038/8964}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the phenomenon of [[energy transfer|energy flow]] occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as [[metabolism]]. Finally, cells contain hereditary information ([[DNA]]), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, [[abiogenesis]], amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.

===Evolution===
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|alt=diagram showing Natural selection favoring predominance of surviving mutation|[[Natural selection]] of a population for dark coloration.]]
{{Main|Evolution}}
A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, and that all life-forms known have a [[Common descent|common origin]]. The theory of evolution postulates that all [[organism]]s on the [[Earth]], both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral [[gene pool]]. This [[last universal common ancestor of all organisms|universal common ancestor of all organisms]] is believed to have appeared about [[Timeline of evolution|3.5 billion years ago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Life Evolving: Molecules, Mind, and Meaning | last=De Duve | first=Christian | location=New York | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2002| page=44 | isbn=978-0-19-515605-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists regard the ubiquity of the [[genetic code]] as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukaryote]]s (see: [[origin of life]]).&lt;ref name="Futuyma"&gt;{{cite book |author=Futuyma, DJ |title=Evolution |year=2005 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0-87893-187-3 |oclc=57311264 |url=https://archive.org/details/evolution0000futu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "evolution" was introduced into the scientific lexicon by [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck]] in 1809,&lt;ref name="p15"&gt;{{cite book |last=Packard |first=Alpheus Spring |title= Lamarck, the founder of Evolution: his life and work with translations of his writings on organic evolution|url=https://archive.org/details/lamarckfoundere05packgoog |year= 1901 |publisher= Longmans, Green. |location=New York | isbn=978-0-405-12562-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fifty years later [[Charles Darwin]] posited a scientific model of natural selection as evolution's driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html | title=The Complete Works of Darwin Online – Biography | publisher=darwin-online.org.uk | access-date=2006-12-15 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107165048/http://darwin-online.org.uk/biography.html | archivedate=2007-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobzhansky |first1=T. |year=1973 |title=Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution |journal=The American Biology Teacher |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=125–29 |doi= 10.2307/4444260|jstor=4444260 |url=|citeseerx=10.1.1.525.3586}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection | editor-last=Carroll | editor-first=Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=Broadview |location= Peterborough, Ontario | isbn=978-1-55111-337-1 | page=15 | quote=As Darwinian scholar Joseph Carroll of the University of Missouri–St. Louis puts it in his introduction to a modern reprint of Darwin's work: "''The Origin of Species'' has special claims on our attention. It is one of the two or three most significant works of all time—one of those works that fundamentally and permanently alter our vision of the world ... It is argued with a singularly rigorous consistency but it is also eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and rhetorically compelling."  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Alfred Russel Wallace]] is recognized as the co-discoverer of this concept as he helped research and experiment with the concept of evolution.)&lt;ref&gt;Shermer p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life found on Earth.

Darwin theorized that species flourish or die when subjected to the processes of [[natural selection]] or [[selective breeding]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin|Darwin, Charles]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic drift]] was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the theory.&lt;ref name=GGS&gt;{{Cite book | last=Simpson | first=George Gaylord | author-link=George Gaylord Simpson | year=1967 | title=The Meaning of Evolution | publisher=Yale University Press | edition=Second | isbn=978-0-300-00952-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary history of the [[species]]—which describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descended—together with its genealogical relationship to every other species is known as its [[phylogeny]]. Widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny. These include the comparisons of [[DNA sequence]]s, a product of [[molecular biology]] (more particularly [[genomics]]), and comparisons of [[fossil]]s or other records of ancient organisms, a product of [[paleontology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/q-more/biology-definition/phylogeny/ |title=Phylogeny |publisher=Bio-medicine.org |date=2007-11-11 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224700/http://www.bio-medicine.org/q-more/biology-definition/phylogeny/ |archivedate=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods, including [[phylogenetics]], [[phenetics]], and [[cladistics]]. (For a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists, see [[evolutionary timeline]].)

Evolution is relevant to the understanding of the natural history of life forms and to the understanding of the organization of current life forms. But, those organizations can only be understood in light of how they came to be by way of the process of evolution. Consequently, evolution is central to all fields of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Montévil, M |author2=Mossio, M |author3=Pocheville, A |author4=Longo, G  | title=Theoretical principles for biology: Variation | journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume=122 | issue=1 | pages=36–50 | date=October 2016 | pmid=27530930 | doi=10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2016.08.005 | url=https://www.academia.edu/27942089 | series=From the Century of the Genome to the Century of the Organism: New Theoretical Approaches | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320150224/http://www.academia.edu/27942089/Theoretical_principles_for_biology_Variation | archivedate=2018-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Genetics}}
[[Gene]]s are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms. A gene is a unit of [[heredity]] and corresponds to a region of [[DNA]] that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into [[protein]]s. Cells [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribe]] a DNA gene into an [[RNA]] version of the gene, and a [[ribosome]] then [[Translation (biology)|translates]] the RNA into a sequence of [[amino acid]]s known as a protein. The [[genetic code|translation code]] from RNA codon to amino acid is the same for most organisms. For example, a sequence of DNA that codes for [[insulin]] in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants.&lt;ref&gt;Marcial, Gene G. (August 13, 2007) [http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-08-12/from-sembiosys-a-new-kind-of-insulin From SemBiosys, A New Kind Of Insulin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029034450/http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-08-12/from-sembiosys-a-new-kind-of-insulin |date=2014-10-29 }}. businessweek.com&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA is found as linear [[chromosome]]s in [[eukaryote]]s, and circular chromosomes in [[prokaryote]]s. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of [[DNA]] and [[histone]]s. The set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], or other locations is collectively known as a cell's [[genome]]. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the [[cell nucleus]], or with small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Thanbichler, M |author2=Wang, SC |author3=Shapiro, L  | title=The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal=Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume=96 | issue=3 | pages=506–21 | date=October 2005 | pmid=15988757 | doi=10.1002/jcb.20519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8472 |title=Genotype definition – Medical Dictionary definitions |publisher=Medterms.com |date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054803/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8472 |archivedate=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homeostasis===
{{Main|Homeostasis}}
[[File:ACTH Negative Feedback.svg|right|thumb|alt=diagram showing feedback loop of hormones|The [[hypothalamus]] secretes [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone|CRH]], which directs the [[pituitary gland]] to secrete [[ACTH]]. In turn, ACTH directs the adrenal cortex to secrete [[glucocorticoid]]s, such as [[cortisol]]. The GCs then reduce the rate of secretion by the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland once a sufficient amount of GCs has been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Raven, PH | author2=Johnson, GB | year=1999 | title=Biology | edition=Fifth | location=Boston | publisher=Hill Companies | page=[https://archive.org/details/biologyjohn00rave/page/1058 1058] | isbn=978-0-697-35353-5 | url=https://archive.org/details/biologyjohn00rave/page/1058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Homeostasis is the ability of an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple [[dynamic equilibrium]] adjustments that are controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms. All living [[organism]]s, whether [[Single celled|unicellular]] or [[multicellular]], exhibit homeostasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rodolfo | first=Kelvin | date=January 2000 | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-homeostasis/ | title=What is homeostasis? | journal=Scientific American | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020456/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-homeostasis | archivedate=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions, a system must detect and respond to perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through [[negative feedback]] that stabilize conditions by reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of [[glucagon]] when sugar levels are too low.

[[File:Energy and life.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|alt=diagram showing human energy process from food input to heat and waste output|Basic overview of [[Bioenergetics|energy and human life]].]]

===Energy===
The survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of [[energy]]. Chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract [[Chemistry#Energy|energy]] from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, [[molecule]]s of [[chemical substance]]s that constitute [[food]] play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, [[chemical reaction]]s; second, food can be transformed into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.

The organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or [[autotroph]]s. Nearly all such organisms originally draw their energy from the sun.&lt;ref name=bryantfrigaard&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bryant, DA |author2=Frigaard, NU  | title=Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated | journal=Trends in Microbiology | volume=14 | issue=11 | pages=488–96 | date=November 2006 | pmid=16997562 | doi=10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants and other [[phototroph]]s use solar energy via a process known as [[photosynthesis]] to convert raw materials into organic molecules, such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], whose bonds can be broken to release energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Smith, AL |title=Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=1997 |page=508 | isbn=978-0-19-854768-6 | quote=Photosynthesis – the synthesis by organisms of organic chemical compounds, esp. carbohydrates, from carbon dioxide using energy obtained from light rather than the oxidation of chemical compounds.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few [[ecosystems]], however, depend entirely on energy extracted by [[chemotroph]]s from [[methane]], [[sulfides]], or other non-[[Solar energy|luminal]] energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Edwards | first=Katrina | title=Microbiology of a Sediment Pond and the Underlying Young, Cold, Hydrologically Active Ridge Flank | journal=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the energy thus captured produces [[biomass]] and energy that is available for growth and development of other [[life]] forms. The majority of the rest of this biomass and energy are lost as waste molecules and heat. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are [[metabolism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Neil A. |last2=Reece |first2=Jane B. |title=Biology |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |year=2001 |chapter=6 |isbn=978-0-8053-6624-2 |oclc=47521441 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/biologyc00camp |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/biologyc00camp }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cellular respiration]].&lt;ref name="Colvard, 2009"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bartsch | first1=John | last2=Colvard | first2=Mary P. | year=2009 | title=The Living Environment | location=New York State | publisher=Prentice Hall | isbn=978-0-13-361202-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is done on both the [[microscope|microscopic]] and [[molecule|molecular]] levels, for unicellular organisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]], as well as the specialized cells of multicellular organisms such as [[human]]s. Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences.

===Physiological===
{{Main|Physiology}}

Physiology is the study of the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into [[plant physiology]] and [[animal physiology]], but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular [[organism]] is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of [[yeast]] cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of [[human physiology]] to non-human species. Plant physiology borrows techniques from both research fields.

Physiology is the study the interaction of how, for example, the [[nervous system|nervous]], [[immune system|immune]], [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[respiratory system|respiratory]], and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with such [[medicine|medically]] oriented disciplines as [[neurology]] and [[immunology]].

===Evolutionary===
[[Current research in evolutionary biology|Evolutionary research]] is concerned with the origin and descent of [[species]], and their change over time. It employs scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines, for example, those with special training in particular [[organism]]s such as [[mammalogy]], [[ornithology]], [[botany]], or [[herpetology]], but are of use in answering more general questions about evolution.

Evolutionary biology is partly based on [[paleontology]], which uses the [[fossil]] record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution,&lt;ref name=Jablonski&gt;{{cite journal | author=Jablonski D | title=The future of the fossil record | journal=Science | volume=284 | issue=5423 | pages=2114–16 | date=June 1999 | pmid=10381868 | doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and partly on the developments in areas such as [[population genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gillespie | first=John H. | authorlink=John H. Gillespie | year=1998 | title=Population Genetics: A Concise Guide | publisher=Johns Hopkins Press | isbn=978-0-8018-5755-3 | url=https://archive.org/details/populationgeneti00john }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, [[developmental biology]] re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] through the study of [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Vassiliki Betta | last=Smocovitis | year=1996 | title=Unifying Biology: the evolutionary synthesis and evolutionary biology | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=978-0-691-03343-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phylogenetics]], [[systematics]], and [[alpha taxonomy|taxonomy]] are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology.

===Systematic===
{{PhylomapB|caption=A [[phylogenetic tree]] of all living things, based on [[rRNA]] [[gene]] data, showing the separation of the three domains [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[archaea]], and [[eukaryote]]s as described initially by [[Carl Woese]]. Trees constructed with other genes are generally similar, although they may place some early-branching groups very differently, presumably owing to rapid rRNA evolution. The exact relationships of the three domains are still being debated.}}

rankings are not shown. This diagram uses a 3 [[Domain (biology)|Domains]] / 6 [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdoms]] format]]
{{Main|Systematics}}

Multiple [[speciation]] events create a tree structured system of relationships between species. The role of [[systematics]] is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Neill | first=Campbell | title=Biology; Fourth edition | publisher=The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company | year=1996 | isbn=978-0-8053-1940-8 | page=G-21 (Glossary) }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, systematics was an active field of research long before evolutionary thinking was common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Douglas | first=Futuyma |authorlink=Douglas Futuyma | title=Evolutionary Biology; Third edition | publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-87893-189-7 | page=88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, living things have been divided into five kingdoms: [[Monera]]; [[Protist]]a; [[Fungus|Fungi]]; [[Plant]]ae; [[Animal]]ia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Margulis, Lynn |author2=Schwartz, KV  |author-link1= Lynn Margulis |title=Five Kingdoms: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth |url=https://archive.org/details/fivekingdomsillu00marg_0 |url-access=registration |edition=3rd |publisher= WH Freeman &amp; Co|year=1997 |isbn=978-0-7167-3183-2 |oclc=223623098}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many scientists now consider this five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the [[three-domain system]]: [[Archaea]] (originally Archaebacteria); [[Bacteria]] (originally Eubacteria) and [[Eukaryote|Eukaryota]] (including [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[plants]], and [[animal]]s).&lt;ref name="domain"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Woese, CR |author2=Kandler, O |author3=Wheelis, ML  | title=Towards a natural system of organisms: proposal for the domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=87 | issue=12 | pages=4576–79 | date=June 1990 | pmid=2112744 | pmc=54159 | doi=10.1073/pnas.87.12.4576 | bibcode=1990PNAS...87.4576W }}&lt;/ref&gt; These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of key biomolecules such as [[ribosome]]s.&lt;ref name="domain"/&gt;

Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is:
[[Domain (biology)|Domain]]; [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]; [[Phylum]]; [[Class (biology)|Class]]; [[Order (biology)|Order]]; [[Family (biology)|Family]]; [[Genus]]; [[Species]].

Outside of these categories, there are obligate intracellular [[parasite]]s that are "on the edge of life"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rybicki, EP | year=1990 | title=The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics | journal=S Afr J Sci | volume=86 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603479 | pages=182–86 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718162450/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230603479_The_classification_of_organisms_at_the_edge_of_life_or_problems_with_virus_systematics | archivedate=2017-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in terms of [[metabolism|metabolic]] activity, meaning that many scientists do not actually classify such structures as alive, due to their lack of at least one or more of the fundamental functions or characteristics that define life. They are classified as [[virus (biology)|viruses]], [[viroid]]s, [[prion]]s, or [[Satellite (biology)|satellites]].

The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''Homo'' is the genus, and ''sapiens'' the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J|author2=Barrie, FR|author3=Buck, WR|author4=Demoulin, V|author5=Greuter, W|author6=Hawksworth, DL|author7=Herendeen, PS|author8=Knapp, S|author9=Marhold, K|author10=Prado, J|author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, WF|author12=Smith, GF|author13=Wiersema, JH|author14=Turland, NJ |display-authors=6 |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

The dominant classification system is called the [[Linnaean taxonomy]]. It includes ranks and [[binomial nomenclature]]. How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN), and the [[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]] (ICNB). The classification of [[viruses]], [[viroids]], [[prions]], and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) and is known as the International Code of Viral Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp |title=ICTV Virus Taxonomy 2009 |publisher=Ictvonline.org |accessdate=2013-10-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225742/http://www.ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp |archivedate=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ictvdbpopsi&gt;&lt;!--citation specified in source--&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090813214826/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/fs_pospi.htm Index of Viruses – Pospiviroidae]'' (2006).

A merging draft, BioCode, was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=The BioCode: Integrated biological nomenclature for the 21st century? | booktitle=Proceedings of a Mini-Symposium on Biological Nomenclature in the 21st Century | last=McNeill | first=John | date=November 1996 | url=http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal/pbio/nomcl/mcne.html | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140104161223/http://www.plantsystematics.org/reveal/pbio/nomcl/mcne.html | archivedate=2014-01-04 | conference= | access-date=2014-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed.

{{Main|Ecology|Ethology|Behavior|Biogeography}}

[[Ecology]] is the study of the distribution and abundance of [[life|living organisms]], the interaction between them and their [[natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Begon, M |author2=Townsend, CR |author3=Harper, JL  | title=Ecology: From individuals to ecosystems |edition=4th |year=2006 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-1117-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and [[biotic factors]] as well as local [[abiotic factors]] (non-living) such as [[climate]] and [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="habitats_of_the_world"&gt;{{cite book | title=Habitats of the world | year=2004 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=U-_mlcy8rGgC&amp;pg=PA238 | publisher=Marshall Cavendish | location=New York | isbn=978-0-7614-7523-1 | page=238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic [[bacterium]] responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African [[savanna]]. For any species, [[behavior]]s can be [[co-operation|co-operative]], [[Competition (biology)|competitive]], [[parasite|parasitic]], or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]]. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an [[ecosystem]].

Ecological systems are studied at several different levels, from the scale of the ecology of individual organisms, to those of [[population]]s, to the [[ecosystem]]s and finally the [[biosphere]]. The term [[population biology]] is often used interchangeably with [[population ecology]], although ''population biology'' is more frequently used in the case of [[diseases]], [[viruses]], and [[microbes]], while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.

[[Ethology]] is the study of animal [[behavior]] (particularly that of social animals such as [[primate]]s and [[canidae|canids]]), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the [[evolution]] of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of [[natural selection]]. In one sense, the first modern ethologist was [[Charles Darwin]], whose book, ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]],'' influenced many ethologists to come.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Black, J | title=Darwin in the world of emotions | journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume=95 | issue=6 | pages=311–13 | date=June 2002 | pmid=12042386 | pmc=1279921 | doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.6.311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biogeography]] studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the [[Earth]], focusing on such topics as [[plate tectonics]], [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] and [[Animal migration|migration]], and [[cladistics]].

==Basic unresolved problems in biology==
{{Main|List of unsolved problems in biology}}
Despite the profound advances made over recent decades in our understanding of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. Some examples are

'''[[Abiogenesis|Origin of life]]'''. While there is very good evidence for the abiotic origin of biological compounds such as [[amino acids]], [[Nucleotide|nucleotides]] and [[Lipid|lipids]], it is largely unclear how these molecules came together to form the first [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Related is the question of [[Extraterrestrial life|extra-terrestrial life]]. If we understand how life originated on earth, we can predict more reliably which conditions are required to generate life on other planets. 

'''Aging'''. At present, there is no consensus view on the underlying cause of aging. Various competing theories are outlined in [[Ageing#Theories|Ageing Theories]].

'''Pattern formation'''. We have a good understanding of [[pattern formation]] in some systems, such as the early [[insect]] [[embryo]], but the generation of many patterns in nature cannot be explained easily, e.g. the stripes in [[Zebra|zebras]] or many [[Snake|snakes]], such as [[Coral snake|coral snakes]]. While we know that the patterns are generated by selective [[Regulation of gene expression|activation or repression of genes]], many of these genes and their regulatory mechanisms remain unknown.

==Branches and career options==
Biology is an area of science with numerous subdisciplines that are concerned with all aspects of life, in fact all aspects of modern human life. That said, there are countless career options, ranging from basic science to industrial or agriculatural applications. These are the main branches of biology:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Branches_of_biology |title=Branches of Biology |publisher=Biology-online.org |accessdate=2013-10-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727104032/http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Branches_of_biology |archivedate=2013-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art28786.asp |title=Biology on |publisher=Bellaonline.com |accessdate=2013-10-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005010344/http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art28786.asp |archivedate=2013-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|For a more detailed list, see ''[[Outline of biology]]''.}}

'''Tokogeny''' or '''tocogeny''' is the biological relationship between parent and offspring, or more generally between ancestors and descendants.  In contradistinction to [[phylogeny]] it applies to individual [[organism]]s as opposed to [[species]].

In the tokogentic system shared characteristics are called ''traits''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Species Concepts and Phylogenetic Theory: A Debate|others=Editors: Quentin Wheeler, Rudolf Meier|publisher=Columbia University Press, 2000|chapter=5: The Phylogenetic Concept (''[[sensu]]'' Wheeler and Platnick)|author=Quentin R.

'''Pinch-induced behavioural inhibition''' ('''PIBI'''), also called '''dorsal immobility''', '''transport immobility''' or '''clipnosis''', is a partially inert state which results from a gentle squeeze of the skin behind the [[neck]].  It is mostly observed among [[Felidae|cats]] and allows a female cat to carry her kitten easily with her jaws. It can be used to restrain most cats effectively in a domestic or veterinary context. The phenomenon also occurs in other animals, such as [[squirrel]]s and [[mice]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-one-myth-about-cats-thats-actually-true-1469745000 ''The one myth about cats that's actually true''] by Robbie Gonzalez.

In [[biology]] and [[botany]], '''indeterminate growth''' is growth that is not terminated in contrast to '''determinate growth''' that stops once a genetically pre-determined structure has completely formed. Thus, a plant that grows and produces [[flower]]s and [[fruit]] until killed by frost or some other external factor is called indeterminate. For example, the term is applied to [[tomato]] varieties that grow in a rather gangly fashion, producing fruit throughout the growing season, and in contrast to a determinate tomato plant, which grows in a more bushy shape and is most productive for a single, larger harvest, then either tapers off with minimal new growth or fruit, or dies.

==Inflorescences==
In reference to an [[inflorescence]] (a shoot specialised for bearing flowers, and bearing no leaves other than [[bract]]s), an indeterminate type (such as a [[raceme]]) is one in which the first flowers to develop and open are from the buds at the base, followed progressively by buds nearer to the growing tip. The growth of the shoot is not impeded by the opening of the early flowers or development of fruits and its appearance is of growing, producing, and maturing flowers and fruit indefinitely. In practice the continued growth of the terminal end necessarily peters out sooner or later, though without producing any definite terminal flower, and in some species it may stop growing before any of the buds have opened. 

Not all plants produce indeterminate inflorescences however; some produce a definite terminal flower that terminates the development of new buds towards the tip of that inflorescence. In most species that produce a '''determinate'' inflorescence in this way, all of the flower buds are formed before the first ones begin to open, and all open more or less at the same time. In some species with determinate inflorescences however, the [[Inflorescence#Terminal flower|terminal flower]] blooms first, which stops the elongation of the main axis, but side buds develop lower down. One type of example is [[Dianthus]] another type is exemplified by [[Allium]] and yet others by [[Daucus]].

==Animals==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
In zoology, indeterminate growth refers to the condition where animals grow rapidly when young, and continue to grow after reaching adulthood although at a slower pace.&lt;ref name="pmid11675785"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = West GB, Brown JH, Enquist BJ | title = A general model for ontogenetic growth | journal = Nature | volume = 413 | issue = 6856 | pages = 628–31 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11675785 | doi = 10.1038/35098076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common in fish, amphibians, reptiles, and many molluscs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Optimal allocation of resources explains interspecific life-history patterns in animals with indeterminate growth | author=Jan Kozłowski | journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B | year=1996 | volume=263 | pages=559–566 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0084}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also refers to the pattern of hair growth sometimes seen in humans and a few domestic breeds, where hair continues to grow in length until it is cut.

==Mushrooms==

Some mushrooms&amp;nbsp;– notably ''[[Cantharellus californicus]]''&amp;nbsp;– also exhibit indeterminate growth.&lt;ref name=BAMS&gt;{{citation |last=Viess |first=Debbie |url=http://www.bayareamushrooms.org/mushroommonth/chanterelle.html |title=Cantharellus californicus: California's Giant, Oak-Loving Golden Chanterelle |publisher=Bay Area Mycological Society |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="7718" xml:space="preserve">'''Feminist biology''' is an approach to [[biology]] that is concerned with the influence of gender values, the removal of gender bias, and the understanding of the overall role of social values in biological research and practices.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{Cite SEP|url-id=feminist-philosophy-biology|title=Feminist Philosophy of Biology|first=Carla|last=Fehr|date=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist Biology, was founded by, among others, Dr. Ruth Bleier of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (who authored the 1984 work “Science and Gender: A Critique of Biology and Its Theories on Women” and inspired the university’s endowed fellowship for feminist biology),&lt;ref&gt;David, Tenembaum. "First in the Nation: UW-Madison Establishes Post-doc in Feminist Biology." University of Wisconsin-Madison News. University of Wisconsin-Madison, 17 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; it aims to enhance biology by incorporating feminist critique in matters varying from the mechanisms of cell biology and sex selection to the [[sex and gender distinction|assessment of the meaning of words such as “gender” and “sex.”]]
Overall, the field is broadly defined and pertains itself to philosophies behind both biological and feminist practice. These considerations make feminist biology debatable and conflictive with itself, particularly when concerning matters of [[biological determinism]], whereby descriptive sex terms of male and female are intrinsically confining, or extreme post-modernism, whereby the body is viewed more as a social construct.&lt;ref&gt;Dominguez, Johnna. "A Fine Line: Feminism and Biology." Club Antro: UA Anthropology Blog Network. University of Alabama, 27 Aug. 2012. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opinions ranging from determinist to postmodernist, however, biologists, feminists, and feminist biologists of varying labels alike have made claims to the utility of applying feminist ideology to biological practice and procedure.
{{Feminism sidebar}}
==Contributions==
[[Donna J. Haraway]], a biologist and primatologist hailing from the University of California, put forth male bias criticisms in 1989 concerning the study of human evolution and culture via primatology by denoting a prominent lack of focus in female primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haraway |first=Donna |date=1989 |title=Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science |publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haraway contributed to a large discovery of behaviors in primate groups regarding mate selection, and female-female interactions derived from observing female primates, citing feminist influences as she studied the female primates in their own merit.

Similarly, feminist cell biologists of The Biology and Gender Study Group have criticized androcentrism in the study of behavior between sexes and “come to look at feminist critique as [they] would any experimental control.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Biology and Gender Study Group | title=The Importance of Feminist Critique for Contemporary Cell Biology | journal=Hypatia | volume=3 | issue=1 | year=1988 | doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1988.tb00056.x | pages=61–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cite a general trend of “active” biological description associated with the sperm gamete and “passive” description to the ovum, comparing such description to an archetypal hero facing many challenges before it finding its static, female home. The group criticized the diction employed by biological readings and textbooks, stating that the more active and risk-associated traits of the ovum (such as its own survival from the whittling of 2&amp;nbsp;million oocytes) are dismissed for the sake of a patterned narrative.

[[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], a professor of Biology and Gender Studies at Brown University, assesses the complexity of defining sex through a [[dichotomy|dichotomous]] lens in a variety of her works such as Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality as well as in an article piece she wrote titled “The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough.” She addresses the existence of intersex individuals and the lack of acknowledgment of their state of being in the context of a dichotomously defined world of sexes – even, if not especially, by medical professionals and surgeons who understand intersex anatomy to a point to where they can surgically alter it to one of the sexes. She states: “Ironically, a more sophisticated knowledge of the complexity of sexual systems has led to the repression of such intricacy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fausto-Sterling | first=Anne | title=The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough | journal=The Sciences | volume=33 | issue=2 | date=1993 | doi=10.1002/j.2326-1951.1993.tb03081.x | pages=20–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fausto-Sterling continues by advocating the reevaluation of what is considered urgent medical intervention in light of the influence she believes social stigma has had on standard medical procedure – which in turn could help open up the possible directions that science could take.

==Motivation==
The motivations of advocating feminist biology are diverse. One of the most common motivations is to challenge the gender biases originated from science, by discerning a more objective, scientific truth from culturally influenced practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schiebinger |first=Londa |date=1999 |title=Has Feminism Changed Science? |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals argue the emergence and development of modern science involved the domination of a female world and the exclusion of women. [[Reductionism]], for instance, is a view that all matters in the universe are arranged hierarchically, and that causation only occurs at the lower levels of this hierarchy&lt;ref name="Fehr"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fehr |first1=Carla |date=2004 |title=Feminism and Science: Mechanism Without Reductionism |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/168388 |journal=NWSA Journal |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=136–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A tight link exists between reductive mechanistic science and [[biological determinism]], contributing to the argument that biological causes are the only causes, or the most important cause, of 'feminine' behavior. This link is due to the reductive assumption that causation acts in an upward direction from lower levels of organization to higher levels of organization&lt;ref name="Fehr"/&gt;. Many feminist biologists focus on dispelling such stigmatic prejudices that influential figures have accepted as scientifically true. 

==Controversy==
There is an ongoing debate on whether a feminist critique should be incorporated in the sciences, especially biology. Some argue that feminist biology is a form of politicization of science, calling to question the legitimacy of feminist biology altogether. On another level, there is debate even within the feminist community on how to deal with biological sex differences. Some account on the importance of accepting biological sex differences to reach gender equality, while others contend that sex differences are overly emphasized in society, contributing to gender stereotypes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schiebinger | first=Londa | title=Introduction: Feminism Inside the Sciences | journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume=28 | issue=3 | year=2003 | doi=10.1086/345319 | pages=859–866}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Individuals such as [[Carla Fehr]] offer constructive criticism for the future of feminist philosophy in the field of biology; she proposes feminist biologists to consider novel questions pertaining to subjects such as the research of genomics in relation to gender.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

[[FMRFamide]], a neuropeptide involved in cardiac activity regulation, is found in ''[[Biomphalaria glabrata]]'', a species of a [[freshwater snail]] best known for its role as the intermediate host for the human-infecting [[trematode]] parasite ''[[Schistosoma mansoni]]''.

This freshwater snail species is used as a [[model organism]], in other words, a [[non-human]] [[species]] which is extensively studied to understand a [[biology|biological]] phenomenon, with the expectation that discoveries made in the model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fields S, Johnston M | title=Cell biology. Whither model organism research? | journal=Science | volume=307 | issue=5717 | pages=1885–6 | date=Mar 2005 | pmid=15790833 | doi=10.1126/science.1108872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Model organisms are [[in vivo]] models and are widely used to research human [[disease]] when [[human experimentation]] would be unfeasible or [[bioethics|unethical]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, E.

==Relevance==
This snail has been studied in relation to human pathology and the [[epidemiology]] of [[schistosomiasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Santama N, Benjamin PR |title=Gene expression and function of FMRFamide-related neuropeptides in the snail ''Lymnaea'' |journal=Microscopy Research Technology |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=547–556 |date=June 2000 |doi= 10.1002/1097-0029(20000615)49:6&lt;547::aid-jemt5&gt;3.3.co;2-p |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''S. masoni'' is known to change its host’s (''B. glabrata'''s) behavior via the upregulation/downregulation of [[neuropeptide]]s such as [[schistosomin]] and NPY, and some studies have reported that FMRFamide is [[aminergic]], and may be implicated in the secretion of molecules to respond to infection with [[parasite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weinlander E, Humphries J |title=5-HT and FMRFamide in the embryonic central nervous system of Biomphalaria glabrata |journal=Lawrence University Honors Projects |date=May 2012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ganglionic [[central nervous system]] (CNS) of ''B. glabrata'' consists of paired cerebral, pedal, pleural, parietal, and buccal ganglia, and one unpaired visceral ganglion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Darnell, J. E. |author2=Lodish, H. F. |author3= Baltimore, D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Molecular cell biology. |journal=Scientific American Books |pages=302–312 |date=1990|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; FMRFamide is concentrated in the concentrated in the cerebral and visceral ganglia, although evidence from current research suggests that FMRFamide moves downward of the head-foot region of the snail as embryonic development proceeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kempf SC, Page LR, Pires A |title=Development of serotonin-like immunoreactivity in the embryos and larvae of nudibranch mollusks with emphasis on the structure and possible function of the apical sensory organ |journal=The Journal of Comparative Neurology |volume=386 |issue=3 |pages=507–528 |date=September 1997 |url= |doi=10.1002/(sici)1096-9861(19970929)386:3&lt;507::aid-cne12&gt;3.0.co;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact role of FMRFamide during early development of the embryonic central nervous system is not well studied. Detection of this neuropeptide is important because its expression lays down the foundation of the CNS in the early stages of development in invertebrates. In recent years, neuromodulatory actions of FMRFamide in invertebrates have become more apparent. This is in part due to the extensive studies done on the Planorbidae and [[Lymnaeidae]] families of pond snails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bulloch AG, Price DA, Murphy AD, Lee TD, Bowes HN |title=FMRFamide peptides in Helisoma: identification and physiological actions at a peripheral synapse |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=3459–69 |date=September 1988 |pmid=3171684|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.08-09-03459.1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FMRFamide expression in ''B. glabrata'' can be detected as early 72 hours, post-cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weinlander E, Humphries J |title=5-HT and FMRFamide in the embryonic central nervous system of Biomphalaria glabrata |journal=Lawrence University Honors Projects |date=May 2012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown its expression pattern in the posterior of the ganglionic nervous system, as the first FMRFamide immunoreactive cell appears at 25-28% of development and is located at the extreme posterior of the embryo. The cell sends a single process on each side and each process follows the body curvature.

As these processes elongate, two lateral FMRFamide-expressing cells are apparent on either side of the body wall. Some studies have suggested that FMRFamide these structures may innervate muscles that originate in trochopore larvae and expand during development. This neuromodulator helps to regulate cardiac activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=López-Vera E, Aguilar MB, Heimer de la Cotera EP | date = Feb 2008 | title = FMRFamide and related peptides in the phylum mollusca | url = | journal = Peptides | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 310–7 | doi=10.1016/j.peptides.2007.09.025| pmid = 18241957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several FMRFamid related peptides are known, regulating various cellular functions and possessing pharmacological actions, such as anti-opiate effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rőszer T, Bánfalvi G | year = 2011 | title = FMRFamide-related peptides: Anti-opiate transmitters acting in apoptosis | url = | journal = Peptides | volume =  34| issue = 1| pages =  177–85| doi = 10.1016/j.peptides.2011.04.011 | pmid = 21524675 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FMRFamide may also play a role in osmoregulation and developmental patterning. This neuropeoptide has multiple functions and controls many processes that allow the embryo to mature into an adult snail.

==Immunocytochemistry of FMRFamide in ''B. glabrata'' embryos==

FMRFamide patterning over the course of embryonic life has been recorded through [[immunofluorescence]]. Embryos at 0 to 144 hours (6 days) post cleavage were extracted from the egg mass and fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hrs at room temperature.  Embryos older than 4 days were pre-treated with 0.5% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution in PBS for 5 minutes to improve primary antibody penetration, and then fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hours at room temperature. Embryos were then washed overnight in 4% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated in blocking solution, 1% normal goal serum in PBS, overnight at 4&amp;nbsp;°C.

After blocking overnight, embryos were treated with a primary antibody solution at 1:2000 (in NGS/PBS). Secondary antibody tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (polyclonal) was incubated at 1:20, overnight at 4&amp;nbsp;°C. Embryos were then mounted on a slide and viewed with fluorescent microscopy.

{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Sociobiology''' is a field of [[biology]] that aims to examine and explain [[social behavior]] in terms of [[evolution]]. It draws from disciplines including [[psychology]], [[ethology]], [[anthropology]], [[evolution]], [[zoology]], [[archaeology]], and [[population genetics]]. Within the study of human [[society|societies]], sociobiology is closely allied to [[Darwinian anthropology]], [[human behavioral ecology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].

Sociobiology investigates social behaviors such as [[mating system | mating patterns]], [[territoriality|territorial fights]], [[pack hunter|pack hunting]], and the hive society of [[social insect]]s. It argues that just as selection pressure led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting with the natural environment, so also it led to the genetic evolution of advantageous social behavior.

While the term "sociobiology" originated at least as early as the 1940s, the concept did not gain major recognition until the publication of [[E. O. Wilson]]'s book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' in 1975. The new field quickly became the subject of [[scientific controversy|controversy]].  Critics, led by [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], argued that genes played a role in human behavior, but that traits such as [[aggressiveness]]  could be explained by social environment rather than by biology. Sociobiologists responded by pointing to the complex relationship between [[nature and nurture]].

==Definition==

E. O. Wilson defined sociobiology as "the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilson, E. O. |authorlink=E. O. Wilson |year=1978 |title=On Human Nature |url=https://archive.org/details/onhumannature00wils |url-access=registration |page=x |publisher=Harvard |isbn=978-0674016385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociobiology is based on the premise that some behaviors (social and individual) are at least partly inherited and can be affected by [[natural selection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mohammed |first1=Sulma I. |last2=Alfarouk |first2=Khalid O. |last3=Elhassan |first3=Ahmed M. |last4=Hamad |first4=Kamal |last5=Ibrahim |first5=Muntaser E. |title=Sociobiological Transition and Cancer |date=2019 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/genetics-of-african-populations-in-health-and-disease/sociobiological-transition-and-cancer/E4FE8995823F33510961E6FDF1293F38 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It begins with the idea that behaviors have evolved over time, similar to the way that physical traits are thought to have evolved. It predicts that animals will act in ways that have proven to be evolutionarily successful over time. This can, among other things, result in the formation of complex social processes conducive to evolutionary fitness.

The discipline seeks to explain behavior as a product of natural selection. Behavior is therefore seen as an effort to preserve one's genes in the population. Inherent in sociobiological reasoning is the idea that certain genes or gene combinations that influence particular behavioral traits can be [[Heredity|inherited]] from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking The Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology | author1=Wilson, David Sloan Wilson |author2=Wilson, Edward O. |author2link=E. O. Wilson | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | year=2007 | volume=82 | issue=4 | pages=327–348 | doi=10.1086/522809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire. This [[adaptive behavior |behavior is adaptive]] because killing the cubs eliminates [[competition (biology)|competition]] for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into heat faster, thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population. Sociobiologists would view this instinctual cub-killing behavior as being inherited through the genes of successfully reproducing male lions, whereas non-killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Packer |first1=Craig |last2=Pusey |first2=Anne E. |title=Adaptations of Female Lions to Infanticide by Incoming Males |journal=Am. Nat.|date=1983 |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=716–728 |url=https://www.cbs.umn.edu/sites/cbs.umn.edu/files/public/downloads/Adaptations_of_female_lions_to_infanticide.pdf |doi=10.1086/284097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|upright|thumb|[[E. O. Wilson]], a central figure in the history of sociobiology, from the publication in 1975 of his book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'']]

The philosopher of biology [[Daniel Dennett]] suggested that the political philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] was the first sociobiologist, arguing that in his 1651 book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' Hobbes had explained the origins of morals in human society from an amoral sociobiological perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea |url=https://archive.org/details/darwinsdangerous0000denn |url-access=registration |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/darwinsdangerous0000denn/page/453 453–454] |isbn=978-0140167344}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The geneticist of animal behavior [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]] coined the word ''sociobiology'' at a 1948 conference on genetics and social behaviour which called for a conjoint development of field and laboratory studies in animal behavior research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Life of J.P. Scott |url=https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/neuroscience/john-paul-scott/the-life-of-jp-scott.html |publisher=Bowling Green State University |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levallois |first1=Clement |title=The Development of Sociobiology in Relation to Animal Behavior Studies, 1946–1975 |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2018 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=419–444 |doi=10.1007/s10739-017-9491-x|pmid=28986758 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. With John Paul Scott's organizational efforts, a  "Section of Animal Behavior and Sociobiology" of the ESA (acronym stands for?) was created in 1956, which became a Division of Animal Behavior of the American Society of Zoology in 1958. In 1956, [[E. O. Wilson]] came in contact this emerging sociobiology through his PhD student Stuart A. Altmann, who had been in close relation with the participants to the 1948 conference. Altmann developed his own brand of sociobiology to study the social behavior of rhesus macaques, using statistics, and was hired as a "sociobiologist" at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in 1965.&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilson's sociobiology is different from [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]]'s or Altmann's, insofar as he drew on mathematical models of social behavior centered on the maximisation of the genetic fitness by [[W. D. Hamilton]], [[Robert Trivers]], [[John Maynard Smith]], and [[George R. Price]]. The three sociobiologies by Scott, Altmann and Wilson have in common to place naturalist studies at the core of the research on animal social behavior and by drawing alliances with emerging research methodologies, at a time when "biology in the field" was threatened to be made old-fashioned by "modern" practices of science (laboratory studies, mathematical biology, molecular biology).&lt;ref name=Dobzhansky1966&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobzhansky |first1=Theodosius |title=Are Naturalists Old-Fashioned? |journal=The American Naturalist |date=September 1966 |volume=100 |issue=915 |pages=541–550 |doi=10.1086/282448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"/&gt;

Once a specialist term, "sociobiology" became widely known in 1975 when Wilson published his book ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis'', which sparked an intense controversy. Since then "sociobiology" has largely been equated with Wilson's vision. The book pioneered and popularized the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviors such as [[altruism]], [[aggression]], and nurturance, primarily in ants (Wilson's own research specialty) and other [[Hymenoptera]], but also in other animals. However, the influence of evolution on behavior has been of interest to biologists and philosophers since soon after the discovery of evolution itself. [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', written in the early 1890s, is a popular example. The final chapter of the book is devoted to sociobiological explanations of human behavior, and Wilson later wrote a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning book, ''[[On Human Nature]]'', that addressed human behavior specifically.&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Walsh, Bryan | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/30/all-time-100-best-nonfiction-books/slide/on-human-nature-by-edward-o-wilson/ | title=All-TIME 100 Nonfiction Books |date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward H. Hagen writes in ''The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology'' that sociobiology is, despite the public controversy regarding the applications to humans, "one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century." "Sociobiology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all biology departments, and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field biologists" Sociobiological research on nonhuman organisms has increased dramatically and continuously in the world's top scientific journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. The more general term [[behavioral ecology]] is commonly substituted for the term sociobiology in order to avoid the public controversy.&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Psychology 2005"&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005. Chapter 5 by Edward H. Hagen &lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Sociobiologists maintain that [[Human nature|human behavior]], as well as nonhuman animal behavior, can be partly explained as the outcome of natural selection. They contend that in order to fully understand behavior, it must be analyzed in terms of evolutionary considerations.

[[Natural selection]] is fundamental to evolutionary theory. Variants of hereditary traits which increase an organism's ability to survive and reproduce will be more greatly represented in subsequent generations, i.e., they will be "selected for". Thus, inherited behavioral mechanisms that allowed an [[organism]] a greater chance of surviving and/or reproducing in the past are more likely to survive in present organisms. That inherited adaptive behaviors are present in nonhuman [[Species|animal species]] has been multiply demonstrated by biologists, and it has become a foundation of [[evolutionary biology]]. However, there is continued resistance by some researchers over the application of evolutionary models to humans, particularly from within the social sciences, where culture has long been assumed to be the predominant driver of behavior.

[[File:Nikolaas Tinbergen 1978.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], whose work influenced sociobiology]]

Sociobiology is based upon two fundamental premises:
* Certain behavioral traits are inherited,
* Inherited behavioral traits have been honed by natural selection. Therefore, these traits were probably "adaptive" in the environment in which the species evolved.

Sociobiology uses [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]]'s [[Tinbergen's four questions|four categories of questions]] and explanations of animal behavior. Two categories are at the species level; two, at the individual level. The species-level categories (often called "ultimate explanations") are
* the function (i.e., [[adaptation]]) that a behavior serves and
* the evolutionary process (i.e., [[phylogeny]]) that resulted in this functionality.
The individual-level categories (often called "proximate explanations") are
* the development of the individual (i.e., [[ontogeny]]) and
* the proximate mechanism (e.g., [[brain anatomy]] and [[hormone]]s).

Sociobiologists are interested in how behavior can be explained logically as a result of selective pressures in the history of a species. Thus, they are often interested in [[instinct]]ive, or [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] behavior, and in explaining the similarities, rather than the differences, between cultures. For example, mothers within many species of [[mammals]] – including humans – are very protective of their [[offspring]]. Sociobiologists reason that this protective behavior likely evolved over time because it helped the offspring of the individuals which had the characteristic to survive. This parental protection would increase in frequency in the population. The social behavior is believed to have evolved in a fashion similar to other types of nonbehavioral [[adaptation]]s, such as a coat of fur, or the sense of smell.

Individual genetic advantage fails to explain certain social behaviors as a result of gene-centred selection. E.O. Wilson argued that evolution may also act upon [[social group|groups]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1975. Chapter 5. "Group Selection and Altruism"&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms responsible for [[group selection]] employ [[paradigms]] and population statistics borrowed from [[evolutionary game theory]]. Altruism is defined as "a concern for the welfare of others". If altruism is genetically determined, then altruistic individuals must reproduce their own altruistic genetic traits for altruism to survive, but when altruists lavish their resources on non-altruists at the expense of their own kind, the altruists tend to die out and the others tend to increase. An extreme example is a soldier losing his life trying to help a fellow soldier. This example raises the question of how altruistic genes can be passed on if this soldier dies without having any children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tessman |first=Irwin |title=Human altruism as a courtship display |journal=Forum |year=1995 |pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within sociobiology, a social behavior is first explained as a sociobiological [[hypothesis]] by finding an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] that matches the observed behavior. Stability of a strategy can be difficult to prove, but usually, it will predict gene frequencies. The hypothesis can be supported by establishing a correlation between the gene frequencies predicted by the strategy, and those expressed in a population.

Altruism between [[social insect]]s and littermates has been explained in such a way. Altruistic behavior, behavior that increases the reproductive fitness of others at the apparent expense of the altruist, in some animals has been correlated to the degree of [[genome]] shared between altruistic individuals. A quantitative description of [[infanticide]] by male harem-mating animals when the [[alpha male]] is displaced as well as [[rodent]] female infanticide and [[fetal resorption]] are active areas of study. In general, females with more bearing opportunities may value offspring less, and may also arrange bearing opportunities to maximize the [[food]] and protection from mates.

An important concept in sociobiology is that temperament traits exist in an [[ecological]] balance. Just as an expansion of a [[sheep]] population might encourage the expansion of a [[wolf]] population, an expansion of altruistic traits within a gene pool may also encourage increasing numbers of individuals with dependent traits.

Studies of human behavior genetics have generally found behavioral traits such as creativity, extroversion, aggressiveness, and [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] have high [[heritability]]. The researchers who carry out those studies are careful to point out that heritability does not constrain the influence that environmental or cultural factors may have on those traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Wendy |last2=Turkheimer |first2=E. |last3=Gottesman |first3=Irving |last4=Bouchard |first4=Thomas |year=2009 |title=Beyond Heritability: Twin Studies in Behavioral Research |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=217–220 |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Johnson%20%282009%29.pdf |accessdate=29 June 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01639.x |pmc=2899491 |pmid=20625474 |quote=Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability. For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008). |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Turkheimer |first=Eric |date=April 2008 |title=A Better Way to Use Twins for Developmental Research |journal=LIFE Newsletter |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2–5 |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Turkheimer%20%282008%29.pdf |accessdate=29 October 2010 |quote=But back to the question: What does heritability mean? Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. . . . Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isn't an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crime|Criminality]] is actively under study, but extremely controversial. There are arguments that in some environments criminal behavior might be adaptive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html The Sociobiology Of Sociopathy: An Integrated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021026131543/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html |date=2002-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Elias Canetti]] also has noted applications of sociobiological theory to cultural practices such as slavery and autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elias Canetti]], ''[[Crowds and Power]]''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1981, p. 444-445.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for premise==
Genetic mouse mutants illustrate the power that genes exert on behaviour. For example, the [[transcription factor]] FEV (aka Pet1), through its role in maintaining the [[serotonergic system]] in the brain, is required for normal [[aggression|aggressive]] and [[anxiety]]-like behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks TJ, Fyodorov DV, Wegman LJ, Lelutiu NB, Pehek EA, Yamamoto B, Silver J, Weeber EJ, Sweatt JD, Deneris ES. Pet-1 ETS gene plays a critical role in 5-HT neuron development and is required for normal anxiety-like and aggressive behaviour]. Neuron. 2003 Jan 23;37(2):233-47&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when FEV is genetically deleted from the mouse genome, male mice will instantly attack other males, whereas their wild-type counterparts take significantly longer to initiate violent behaviour. In addition, FEV has been shown to be required for correct maternal behaviour in mice, such that offspring of mothers without the FEV factor do not survive unless cross-fostered to other wild-type female mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerch-Haner | first1 = JK | last2 = Frierson | first2 = D | last3 = Crawford | first3 = LK | last4 = Beck | first4 = SG | last5 = Deneris | first5 = ES | date = Sep 2008 | title = Serotonergic transcriptional programming determines maternal behavior and offspring survival | url = | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 11 | issue = 9| pages = 1001–3 | doi=10.1038/nn.2176| pmid = 19160496 | pmc = 2679641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A genetic basis for instinctive behavioural traits among non-human species, such as in the above example, is commonly accepted among many biologists; however, attempting to use a genetic basis to explain complex behaviours in human societies has remained extremely controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Helen |title='Wilson,' They Said, 'Your All Wet!' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/wilson-naturalist.html |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=21 July 2015 |date=16 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=Sociobiology: the art of storytelling |journal=New Scientist |date=16 November 1978 |volume=80 |issue=1129 |pages=530–533|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tRj7EyRFVqYC&amp;pg=PA530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

[[Steven Pinker]] argues that critics have been overly swayed by politics and a fear of [[biological determinism]],{{efn|Biological determinism was a right wing philosophy underlying the [[social Darwinism|social Darwinian]] and [[Eugenics#History|eugenics movements]] of the early 20th century, and [[History of the race and intelligence controversy|controversies in the history of intelligence testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Garland E. |title=The Roots of Biological Determinism: review of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1984 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=141–145 |jstor=4330882 |doi=10.1007/bf00397505}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} accusing among others [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] of being "radical scientists", whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pinker, Steven | authorlink=Steven Pinker |title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=2002 |page=149 |isbn=978-0-14-200334-3 |quote=A surprising number of intellectuals, particularly on the left, do deny that there is such a thing as inborn talent, especially intelligence. Stephen Jay Gould's 191 bestseller ''The Mismeasure of Man'' was written to debunk 'the abstraction of intelligence as a single entity ... and the use of these numbers to rank people in a single series of worthiness'| title-link=The Blank Slate }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Lewontin, [[Steven Rose]] and [[Leon Kamin]], who drew a distinction between the politics and history of an idea and its scientific validity,&lt;ref name=lrk84&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richard Lewontin |author2=Leon Kamin |author3=Steven Rose | title=Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology, and Human Nature |url=https://archive.org/details/notinourgenes00rich |url-access=registration | publisher=Pantheon Books | year=1984 | isbn=978-0-394-50817-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that sociobiology fails on scientific grounds. Gould grouped sociobiology with [[eugenics]], criticizing both in his book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |year=1996 |title=The Mismeasure of Man |url=https://archive.org/details/mismeasureofman00goul_1 |url-access=registration |page=Introduction to the Revised Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] has expressed views on sociobiology on several occasions. During a 1976 meeting of the [[Sociobiology Study Group]], as reported by [[Ullica Segerstråle]], Chomsky argued for the importance of a sociobiologically informed notion of human nature.{{sfn|Segerstråle|2000|p=205}} Chomsky argued that human beings are biological organisms and ought to be studied as such, with his criticism of the "[[blank slate]]" doctrine in the social sciences (which would inspire a great deal of Steven Pinker's and others' work in evolutionary psychology), in his 1975 ''Reflections on Language''.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1975), ''Reflections on Language'':10. New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky further hinted at the possible reconciliation of his anarchist political views and sociobiology in a discussion of [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', which focused more on altruism than aggression, suggesting that anarchist societies were feasible because of an innate human tendency to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky, Noam]] (1995). [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199505--.htm#TXT2.23 "Rollback, Part II."] ''Z Magazine'' 8 (Feb.): 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson has claimed that he had never meant to imply what ''ought'' to be, only what ''is'' the case. However, some critics have argued that the language of sociobiology readily slips from "is" to "ought",&lt;ref name=lrk84/&gt; an instance of the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. Pinker has argued that opposition to stances considered anti-social, such as [[ethnic nepotism]], is based on [[morality|moral]] assumptions, meaning that such opposition is not [[falsifiable]] by scientific advances.&lt;ref name=Pinker2002&gt;[[Steven Pinker|Pinker, Steven]] (2002). ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. New York: Viking. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The history of this debate, and others related to it, are covered in detail by {{harvtxt|Cronin|1993}}, {{harvtxt|Segerstråle|2000}}, and {{harvtxt|Alcock|2001}}.

'''Encapsulin nanocompartments''', or '''encapsulin protein cages''', are spherical bacterial organelle-like compartments roughly 25-30&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter that are involved in various aspects of metabolism, in particular protecting bacteria from oxidative stress.

'''Pursuit predation''' is a form of [[predation]] in which predators give chase to fleeing prey. The chase can be initiated either by the predator or by the prey, should the prey be alerted to a predator's presence and attempt to flee before the predator gives chase. The chase ends when either the predator captures and consumes the prey, or the prey escapes. Pursuit predation is typically observed in carnivorous species within the kingdom [[Animalia Kingdom|Animalia]], with some iconic examples being [[cheetah]]s, [[lion]]s, and [[Gray wolf|wolves]].

Pursuit predation is an alternate predation strategy to [[ambush predation]]. While pursuit predators use a detection and pursuit phase in order to obtain prey, ambush predators use stealth to capture prey. Strength and speed are important to pursuit predators, whereas ambush predators ignore these in favor of surprise from a typically concealed location. While the two patterns of predation are not mutually exclusive, morphological differences in body plan can create a bias in an organism towards each type of predation.

One particular form of pursuit predation is [[persistence hunting]], and some animals are examples of both types of predator.

== Strategy ==
There is still uncertainty as to whether predators behave with a general tactic or strategy while preying.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Combes | first1 = SA | last2 = Salcedo | first2 = MK | last3 = Pandit | first3 = MM | last4 = Iwasaki | first4 = JM | year = 2013 | title = Capture Success and Efficiency of Dragonflies Pursuing Different Types of Prey | url = | journal = Integrative and Comparative Biology | volume =  53| issue = 5| pages = 787–798 | doi=10.1093/icb/ict072 | pmid=23784698}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, among pursuit predators, there are several common behaviors. Often, predators will scout potential prey, assessing prey quantity and density prior to engaging in a pursuit. Certain predators choose to pursue prey primarily in a group of conspecifics; such animals are known as [[pack hunter]]s or group pursuers. Other species choose to hunt alone. These two behaviors are typically due to differences in hunting success, where some groups are very successful in groups and others are more successful alone. Pursuit predators may also choose to either exhaust their metabolic resources rapidly &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=C.R. |last2=Rowntree |first2=V.J. |year=1973 |title=Temperature regulation and heat balance in running cheetahs: A strategy for sprinters? |journal=Am J Physiol |volume=224 |issue=4 |pages=848–851 |doi=10.1152/ajplegacy.1973.224.4.848 |pmid=4698801}}&lt;/ref&gt; or pace themselves during a chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Creel |first1=S. |last2=Creel |first2=N.M. |year=1995 |title=Communal hunting and pack size in African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus [Electronic version] |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1325–1339 |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80048-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This choice can be influenced by prey species, seasonal settings, or temporal settings. Predators that rapidly exhaust their metabolic resources during a chase tend to first stalk their prey, slowly approaching their prey to decrease chase distance and time. When the predator is at a closer distance (one that would lead to easier prey capture), it finally gives chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mech, D. |year=1970 |title=The Wolf: The ecology and behaviour of an endangered species |location=Minneapolis, MN |publisher=University of Minnesota Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacing pursuit is more commonly seen in group pursuit, as individual animals do not need to exert as much energy to capture prey. However, this type of pursuit requires group coordination, which may have varying degrees of success. Since groups can engage in longer chases, they often focus on separating a weaker or slower prey item during pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kruuk, H. |year=1972 |title=The Spotted Hyena |url=https://archive.org/details/spottedhyenastud0000kruu |url-access=registration |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morphologically speaking, while ambush predation requires stealth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de&amp;nbsp;Vries |first1=M.S. |last2=Murphy |first2=E.A.K. |last3=Patek |first3=S.N. |year=2012 |title=Strike mechanics of an ambush predator: The spearing mantis shrimp |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=215 |issue= Pt 24 |pages=4374–4384 |doi=10.1242/jeb.075317 |pmid=23175528}}&lt;/ref&gt; pursuit predation requires speed; pursuit predators are proportionally long-limbed and equipped with cursorial adaptations.&lt;ref name="Janis" /&gt; Current theories suggest that this proportionally long-limbed approach to body plan was an evolutionary countermeasure to prey adaptation.&lt;ref name = "Janis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Janis |first1=C.M. |last2=Wilhelm |first2=P.B. |year=1993 |title=Were there mammalian pursuit predators in the Tertiary?

==Group pursuers==

===Vertebrates===
[[File:Three dolphins.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A small pod of dolphins]]
Group pursuers hunt with a collection of conspecifics. Group pursuit is usually seen in species of relatively high [[sociality]]; in vertebrates, individuals often seem to have defined roles in pursuit.

==== Mammals ====
[[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'') packs have been known to split into several smaller groups while in pursuit; one group initiates the chase, while the other travels ahead of the prey's escape path. The group of chase initiators coordinate their chase to lead the prey towards the location of the second group, where the prey's escape path will be effectively cut off.&lt;ref&gt;Natural World Safaris. (2015, October 16). In 10 interesting facts about African wild dogs.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bottlenose dolphin]]s (''Tursiops'') have been shown exhibiting similar behaviors of pursuit role specialization. One group within the dolphin pod, known as the drivers, give chase to the fish - forcing the fish into a tight circle formation, while the other group of the pod, the barriers, approach the fish from the opposite direction. This two-pronged attack leaves the fish with only the option of jumping out of the water to escape the dolphins. However, the fish are completely vulnerable in the air; it is at this point when the dolphins leap out and catch the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gazda | first1=S.

==== Birds ====
While birds are generally believed to be individual hunters, there are a few examples of birds that cooperate during pursuits. [[Harris's hawk]]s (''Parabuteo unicinctus'') have two cooperative strategies for hunting: Surrounding and cover penetration, and long chase relay attack.

The first strategy involves a group of hawks surrounding prey hidden under some form of cover, while another hawk attempts to penetrate the prey's cover. The penetration attempt flushes the prey out from its cover where it is swiftly killed by one of the surrounding hawks.&lt;ref name=Bednarz_1988/&gt;

The second strategy is less commonly used: It involves a "relay attack" in which a group of hawks, led by a "lead" hawk, engage in a long chase for prey. The "lead" hawk will dive in order to kill the prey. If the dive is unsuccessful, the role of the "lead" shifts to another hawk who will then dive in another attempt to kill the prey. During one observed relay attack, 20 dives and hence 20&amp;nbsp;lead switches were exhibited.&lt;ref name=Bednarz_1988&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bednarz |first1=J.C. |year=1988 |title=Cooperative Hunting in Harris' Hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) |journal=Science |volume=239 |issue=4847 |pages=1525–1527 |doi=10.1126/science.239.4847.1525 |pmid=17772751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invertebrates===
[[File:Asian Giant Hornet (Vespa mandarinia) (6027759338).jpg|thumb|Asian Giant Hornet (''Vespa mandarinia'')|170x170px]]

As in vertebrates, there are many species of invertebrates which actively pursue prey in groups and exhibit task specialization, but while the vertebrates change their behavior based on their role in hunting, invertebrate task delegation is usually based on actual morphological differences. The vast majority of [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[insect]]s have castes within a population which tend to differ in size and have specialized structures for different tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ecology and Evolution of Social Organization: Insights from Fire Ants and Other Highly Eusocial Insects|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|date=1995-01-01|pages=631–656|volume=26|first=Kenneth G.|last=Ross|first2=Laurent|last2=Keller|jstor=2097222|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.26.1.631|url=https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_978B777C54B0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differentiation is taken to the extreme in the groups [[Termite|isoptera]] and [[hymenoptera]], or termites and [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s respectively.

[[Termite]]-hunting ants of the genus ''[[Pachycondyla]]'', also known as Matabele ants, form raiding parties consisting of ants of different castes, such as soldier ants and worker ants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Behavioral ecology of the neotropical termite-hunting ant Pachycondyla (= Termitopone) marginata: colony founding, group-raiding and migratory patterns|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=1995-12-01|issn=0340-5443|pages=373–383|volume=37|issue=6|doi=10.1007/BF00170584|first=Inara R.|last=Leal|first2=Paulo S.|last2=Oliveira}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldier ants are much larger than worker ants, with more powerful mandibles and more robust [[exoskeleton]]s, and so they make up the front lines of raiding parties and are responsible for killing prey. Workers usually butcher and carry off the killed prey, while supporting the soldiers. The raiding parties are highly mobile and move aggressively into the colonies of termites, often breaking through their outer defenses and entering their mounds. The ants do not completely empty the mound of termites, instead they only take a few, allowing the termites to recover their numbers so that the ants have a steady stream of prey.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Asian giant hornet]]s, ''Vespa mandarinia'', form similar raiding parties to hunt their prey, which usually consists of [[Honey bee|honeybees.]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Heat and carbon dioxide generated by honeybees jointly act to kill hornets|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=2009-06-24|issn=0028-1042|pages=1133–1136|volume=96|issue=9|doi=10.1007/s00114-009-0575-0|first=Michio|last=Sugahara|first2=Fumio|last2=Sakamoto|pmid=19551367}}&lt;/ref&gt; The giant hornets group together and as a team can decimate an entire honeybee colony, especially those of non-native European honeybees. Alone, the hornets are subject to attack by the smaller bees, who swarm the hornet and vibrate their abdomens to generate heat, collectively cooking the hornet until it dies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; By hunting in groups, the hornets avoid this problem.

[[File:Cheetah chasing Thompsons gazelle (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.75&lt;!--fmt for low img--&gt;|Cheetah chasing Thomson's gazelle]]

While most big cat species are individual, ambush predators, [[Cheetahs]] (''Acinonyx jubatus'') are pursuit predators. Widely known as the fastest terrestrial animal, with speeds reaching 61–64 miles per hour, cheetahs take advantage of their speed during chases.&lt;ref&gt;"10 Fastest Animals On Earth - Fastest Animals In The World." Conservation Institute. N.p., 06 Apr. 2014. Web. 16 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Sharp | first1=N.

Barking Zebra Tours. N.p., 27 Sept. 2013. Web. 16 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these limitations, cheetahs are often observed running at moderate speeds during chases. There are claims that the key to cheetahs' pursuit success may not be just their speed. Cheetahs are extremely agile, able to maneuver and change directions at very high speeds in very short amounts of time. This extensive maneuverability can make up for unsustainable high speed pursuit, as it allows cheetahs to quickly close the distance between prey without decreasing their speed when prey change direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Wilson | first1=A.

==== Birds ====
The [[Painted redstart]] (''Myioborus pictus'') is one of the most well documented flush pursuers. When flies, prey for redstarts, are alerted of the presence of predators, they respond by fleeing. Redstarts take advantage of this anti-predator response by spreading and orienting their easily noticeable wings and tails, alerting the flies, but only when they are in a position where the flies' escape path intersects with the redstart's central field of vision. When prey's path are in this field of vision, the redstart's prey capture rate is at its maximum. Once the flies begin to flee, the redstart begins to chase. It has been proposed that redstarts exploit two aspects of the visual sensitivity of their prey: sensitivity to the location of the stimulus in the prey's visual field and sensitivity to the direction of stimulus environment.&lt;ref name="Jablonski, P.

G 2001"/&gt;

===Invertebrates===
[[File:Gomphus vulgatissimus with a prey 002.jpg|thumb|[[Dragonfly]] with prey]]

[[Dragonflies]] are skilled aerial pursuers; they have a 97% success rate for prey capture.&lt;ref&gt;Olberg RM, Worthington AH, Venator KR J Comp Physiol A. 2000 Feb; 186(2):155-62.&lt;/ref&gt; This success rate is a consequence of the "decision" on which prey to pursue, based on initial conditions. Observations of several species of perching dragonflies show more pursuit initiations at larger starting distances for larger size prey species than for much smaller prey. Further evidence points to a potential bias towards larger prey, due to more substantial metabolic rewards. This bias is in spite of the fact that larger prey are typically faster and choosing them results in less successful pursuits. Dragonflies high success rate for prey capture may also be due to their interception foraging method.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Unlike [[classical pursuit]], in which the predator aims for the current position of their prey, dragonflies predict the prey's direction of motion,&lt;ref name="Gonzalez-Bellido Peng Yang Georgopoulos pp. 696–701"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gonzalez-Bellido | first=P.

Perching dragonflies ([[Libellulidae]] family), have been observed "staking out" high density prey spots prior to pursuit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; There are no noticeable distinctions in prey capture efficiency between males and females. Further, percher dragonflies are bound by their visual range. They are more likely to engage in pursuit when prey come within a subtended angle of around 1-2 degrees. Angles greater than this are outside of a dragonflies visual range.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Evolutionary basis of the behavior ==

=== Evolution as a countermeasure ===
Current theory on the evolution of pursuit predation suggests that the behavior is an evolutionary countermeasure to prey adaptation. Prey animals vary in their likelihood to avoid predation, and it is predation failure that drives evolution of both prey and predator.&lt;ref name = "Vermeij"&gt;Geerat Vermeij, The American Naturalist
Vol. 120, No. 6 (Dec., 1982), pp. 701-720&lt;/ref&gt; Predation failure rates vary wildly across the animal kingdom; raptorial birds can fail anywhere from 20% to 80% of the time in predation, while predatory mammals usually fail more than half the time.&lt;ref name="Vermeij" /&gt; Prey adaptation drives these low rates in three phases: the detection phase, the pursuit phase, and the resistance phase.&lt;ref name = "Holling"&gt;Holling, C. S. (1966). The functional response of invertebrate predators to prey density. Memoirs of the Entomological Society of Canada, 98(S48), 5-86.&lt;/ref&gt; The pursuit phase drove the evolution of distinct behaviors for pursuit predation. [[File:Phases of Pursuit Predation.jpg|thumb|Phases of Pursuit Predation]]
As selective pressure on prey is higher than on predators &lt;ref name="Vermeij" /&gt; adaptation usually occurs in prey long before the reciprocal adaptations in predators. Evidence in the fossil record supports this, with no evidence of modern pursuit predators until the late Tertiary period.&lt;ref name="Janis"/&gt; Certain adaptations, like long limbs in ungulates, that were thought to be adaptive for speed against predatory behavior have been found to predate predatory animals by over 20 million years. Because of this, modern pursuit predation is an adaptation that may have evolved separately and much later as a need for more energy in colder and more arid climates.&lt;ref name="Janis" /&gt; Longer limbs in predators, the key morphological adaptation required for lengthy pursuit of prey, is tied in the fossil record to the late Tertiary. It is now believed that modern pursuit predators like the wolf and lion evolved this behavior around this time period as a response to ungulates increasing feeding range.&lt;ref name="Janis" /&gt; As ungulate prey moved into a wider feeding range to discover food in response to changing climate, predators evolved the longer limbs and behavior necessary to pursue prey across larger ranges. In this respect, pursuit predation is not co-evolutionary with prey adaptation, but a direct response to prey. Prey's adaptation to climate is the key formative reason for evolving the behavior and morphological necessities of pursuit predation.

In addition to serving as a countermeasure to prey adaptation, pursuit predation has evolved in some species as an alternative, facultative mechanism for foraging. For example, [[polar bear]]s typically act as specialized predators of [[Pinniped|seal]] pups and operate in a manner closely predicted by the [[optimal foraging theory]]. However, they have been seen to occasionally employ more energy-inefficient pursuit predation tactics on flightless geese. This alternative predatory strategy may serve as a back-up resource when optimal foraging is circumstantially impossible, or may even be a function of filling dietary needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iles | first1 = D.

=== Evolution from an ecological basis ===
Pursuit predation revolves around a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move to find new foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density,&lt;ref name = "Krebs"&gt;Krebs, J. R. (1978). Optimal foraging: decision rules for predators. Behavioural ecology: an evolutionary approach, 23-63.&lt;/ref&gt; and prey should therefore avoid these areas.&lt;ref name = "Sih"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sih | first1 = Andrew | year = 1984 | title = The Behavioral Response Race Between Predator and Prey | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 123 | issue = 1| pages = 143–150 | doi=10.1086/284193}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, dilution factor may be a reason to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, dilution factor seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations.&lt;ref name = "Li"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Li | first1 = Z. Z. | last2 = Gao | first2 = M. | last3 = Hui | first3 = C. | last4 = Han | first4 = X.

By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and prey population through population synchrony. Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations in synchrony, which increases metapopulation persistence.&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Pursuit predation’s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out.&lt;ref name = "Leggett"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = G. A. | last2 = Leggett | first2 = W. C. | year = 1990 | title = The importance of scale to predator-prey spatial correlations: an example of Atlantic fishes | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 71| issue = 1| pages = 33–43 | doi=10.2307/1940245| jstor = 1940245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuit predation can then be supported as an adaptive mechanism for not just individual feeding success but also [[metapopulation]] persistence.

==Anti-predator adaptation to pursuit predation==

===Anti-predator adaptation===
{{further|Anti-predator adaptation}}

Just as the [[evolutionary arms race]] has led to the development of pursuit behavior of predators, so too has it led to the anti-predator adaptations of prey. Alarm displays such as eastern swamphen's tail flicking, white-tailed deer's tail flagging, and  Thomson's gazelles' stotting have been observed deterring pursuit.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hasson | first1 = Oren | year = 1991 | title = Pursuit-deterrent Signals: Communication between Prey and Predator | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 6 | issue = 10| pages = 325–29 | doi=10.1016/0169-5347(91)90040-5| pmid = 21232498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tactic are believed to signal that a predator's presence is known and, therefore, pursuit will be much more difficult. These displays are more frequent when predators are at an intermediate distance away. Alarm displays are used more often when prey believe predators are more prone to change their decision to pursue. For instance, cheetahs, common predators of Thomson's gazelles, are less likely to change their choice to pursue. As such, gazelles stott less when cheetahs are present than when other predators are present.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition to behavioral adaptations, there are also morphological anti-predator adaptations to pursuit predators. For example, many birds have evolved rump feathers that fall off with much less force than the feathers of their other body parts. This allows for easier escape from predator birds, as avian predators often approach prey from their rump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moller | first1 = A. P. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = J.

=== The confusion effect ===
[[File:Wilderbeest.jpg|thumb|Wildebeest in a herd, showing little differentiation between individuals (low oddity)]]

In many species that fall prey to pursuit predation, gregariousness on a massive scale has evolved as a protective behavior. Such herds can be conspecific (all individuals are of one species) or heterospecific. This is primarily due to the [[Anti-predator adaptation#Predator confusion|confusion effect]], which states that if prey animals congregate in large groups, predators will have more difficulty identifying and tracking specific individuals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Oddity and the 'Confusion Effect' in Predation.|last = Landeau|first = Laurie|date = 1986|journal = Animal Behaviour|doi = 10.1016/s0003-3472(86)80208-1 |last2 = Terborgh|first2 = John |volume=34 |issue = 5|pages=1372–1380}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has greater influence when individuals are visually similar and less distinguishable. In groups where individuals are visually similar, there is a negative correlation between group size and predator success rates. This may mean that the overall number of attacks decreases with larger group size or that the number of attacks per kill increases with larger group size.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Groups Confuse Predators by Exploiting Perceptual Bottlenecks: a Connectionist Model of the Confusion Effect.|last = Krakauer|first = David C.|date = 1995|journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|doi = 10.1007/bf00177338|pmid = |access-date =|volume=36|issue = 6|pages=421–429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is especially true in open habitats, such as [[grassland]]s or [[Pelagic zone|open ocean]] ecosystems, where view of the prey group is unobstructed, in contrast to a forest or [[reef]]. Prey species in these open environments tend to be especially gregarious, with notable examples being [[starling]]s and [[sardine]]s. When individuals of the herd are visually dissimilar, however, the success rate of predators increases dramatically.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In one study, [[wildebeest]] on the African Savannah were selected at random and had their horns painted white. This introduced a distinction, or oddity, into the population; researchers found that the wildebeest with white horns were preyed upon at substantially higher rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = The Spotted Hyena. A Study Of Predation and Social Behavior.|last = Kruuk|first = Hans|date = 1973|journal = The Journal of Animal Ecology|doi = 10.2307/3145|pmid = |volume=42|issue = 3|pages=822–824|jstor = 3145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By standing out, individuals are not as easily lost in the crowd, and so predators are able to track and pursue them with higher fidelity. This has been proposed as the reason why many schooling fish show little to no [[sexual dimorphism]], and why many species in heterospecific schools bear a close resemblance to other species in their school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Proteins of the '''Betaine/Carnitine/Choline Transporter''' ('''BCCT''') '''family''' are found in [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. The BCCT family is a member a large group of secondary transporters, the [[APC Superfamily|APC superfamily]]. Their common functional feature is that they all transport molecules with a quaternary ammonium group [R-N (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]. The BCCT family proteins vary in length between 481 and 706 amino [[acyl]] residues and possess 12 putative [[Transmembrane segment|transmembrane α-helical spanners]] (TMSs).  The x-ray structures reveal two 5 TMS repeats with the total number of TMSs being 10. These porters catalyze bidirectional [[uniport]] or are energized by [[Proton-motive force|pmf-driven]] or smf-driven proton or sodium ion [[symport]], respectively, or else by substrate:substrate [[antiport]]. Some of these permeases exhibit osmosensory and osmoregulatory properties inherent to their polypeptide chains.&lt;ref name=TCDB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saier|first1=MH Jr.|title=2.A.15 The Betaine/Carnitine/Choline Transporter (BCCT) Family|url=http://tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.15|website=Transporter Classification Database|publisher=Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The structures of the sodium-independent carnitine/butyrobetaine antiporter CaiT from ''Proteus mirabilis'' (PmCaiT) ({{PDB2|4M8J}}) and from ''E. coli'' (EcCaiT)({{PDB2|3HFX}}) were determined.&lt;ref name=Schulze&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schulze|first1=S|last2=Köster|first2=S|last3=Geldmacher|first3=U|last4=Terwisscha van Scheltinga|first4=AC|last5=Kühlbrandt|first5=W|title=Structural basis of Na(+)-independent and cooperative substrate/product antiport in CaiT.|journal=Nature|date=September 9, 2010|volume=467|issue=7312|pages=233–6|doi=10.1038/nature09310|pmid=20829798|url=https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/2585961/2010NatureSchulze.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most members of the BCCT family are Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;- or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent, whereas EcCaiT is a Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;- and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent substrate:product antiporter. The three-dimensional architecture of CaiT resembles that of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent transporters [http://www.tcdb.org/search/index.php?query=LeuT&amp;type=system LeuT] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.15.1.10 BetP], but in CaiT, a methionine sulphur takes the place of the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to coordinate the substrate in the central transport site, accounting for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; independence. Both CaiT structures ({{PDB2|SWSW}}, {{PDB2|4M8J}}) show the fully open, inward-facing conformation, and thus complete the set of functional states that describe the alternating access mechanism. EcCaiT ({{PDB2|SWSX}}, {{PDB2|3HFX}}) contains two bound butyrobetaine substrate molecules, one in the central transport site, the other in an extracellular binding pocket. In the structure of PmCaiT, a tryptophan side chain occupies the transport site, and access to the extracellular site is blocked. Binding of both substrates to CaiT reconstituted into proteoliposomes is cooperative, with [[Hill coefficient]]s of up to 1.7, indicating that the extracellular site is regulatory. Schulze et al. (2010) proposed a mechanism whereby the occupied regulatory site increases the binding affinity of the transport site and initiates substrate translocation.&lt;ref name=Schulze/&gt; Glycine betaine transporters have been found to contain a conserved region with four tryptophans in their central region.&lt;ref name="PUB00002302"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kempf B, Bremer E, Kappes RM |title=Three transport systems for the osmoprotectant glycine betaine operate in Bacillus subtilis: characterization of OpuD |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=178 |issue=17 |pages=5071–5079 |year=1996 |pmid=8752321 |pmc=178300|doi=10.1128/jb.178.17.5071-5079.1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Most secondary-active transporters transport their substrates using an [[electrochemical ion gradient]], but the carnitine transporter (CaiT) is an ion-independent, L-carnitine/gamma-butyrobetaine antiporter. Crystal structures of CaiT from ''E. coli'' and ''Proteus mirabilis'' revealed the inverted five-transmembrane-helix repeat similar to that in the amino acid/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symporter, LeuT. Kalayil et al. (2013) showed that mutations of arginine 262 (R262) made CaiT Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent with increased transport activity in the presence of a membrane potential, in agreement with substrate/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cotransport. R262 also plays a role in substrate binding by stabilizing the partly unwound TM1' helix.&lt;ref name=Kalayil&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalayil|first1=S|last2=Schulze|first2=S|last3=Kühlbrandt|first3=W|title=Arginine oscillation explains Na+ independence in the substrate/product antiporter CaiT.|date=October 22, 2013|volume=110|issue=43|pages=17296–301|doi=10.1073/pnas.1309071110|pmid=24101465|pmc=3808595|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modeling CaiT from ''P. mirabilis'' in the outward-open and closed states on the corresponding structures of the related symporter BetP revealed alternating orientations of the buried R262 side chain, which mimic sodium binding and unbinding in the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-coupled substrate symporters. A similar mechanism may be operative in other Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-independent transporters, in which a positively charged amino acid replaces the cotransported cation. The oscillation of the R262 side chain in CaiT indicates how a positive charge triggers the change between outward-open and inward-open conformations.&lt;ref name=Kalayil /&gt;

==Transport reactions==
The generalized transport reactions catalyzed by members of the BCCT family are:&lt;ref name=TCDB /&gt;

::Substrate (out) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Substrate (in) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)

::Substrate (out) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Substrate (in) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)

::Substrate-1 (out) + Substrate-2 (in) → Substrate-1 (in) + Substrate-2 (out)

::Substrate (out) ⇌ Substrate (in)

:::Substrate = a quaternary amine

The '''Amino Acid-Polyamine-Organocation (APC) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.a.3 TC# 2.A.3]) of transport proteins includes members that function as solute:cation symporters and solute:solute antiporters.&lt;ref name="Saier 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saier MH | title = Families of transmembrane transporters selective for amino acids and their derivatives | journal = Microbiology | volume = 146 ( Pt 8) | issue = 8 | pages = 1775–95 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10931885 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-146-8-1775 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wong 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong FH, Chen JS, Reddy V, Day JL, Shlykov MA, Wakabayashi ST, Saier MH | title = The amino acid-polyamine-organocation superfamily | journal = Journal of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–13 | date = 2012 | pmid = 22627175 | doi = 10.1159/000338542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schweikhard&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Schweikhard ES, Ziegler CM | title = Amino acid secondary transporters: toward a common transport mechanism | journal = Current Topics in Membranes | volume = 70 | pages = 1–28 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23177982 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-394316-3.00001-6 | isbn = 9780123943163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perland E, Fredriksson R | title = Classification Systems of Secondary Active Transporters | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 305–315 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 27939446 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2016.11.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They occur in bacteria, archaea, fungi, unicellular eukaryotic protists, slime molds, plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Saier 2000"/&gt; They vary in length, being as small as 350 residues and as large as 850 residues.

==Members of APC Family==

Members of one subfamily within the APC family ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.9#2.A.3.9 SGP; TC# 2.A.3.9]) are amino acid receptors rather than transporters &lt;ref name=Cabrera&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cabrera-Martinez RM, Tovar-Rojo F, Vepachedu VR, Setlow P | title = Effects of overexpression of nutrient receptors on germination of spores of Bacillus subtilis | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 185 | issue = 8 | pages = 2457–64 | date = April 2003 | pmid = 12670969 | pmc = 152624 | doi = 10.1128/jb.185.8.2457-2464.2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are truncated at their C-termini, relative to the transporters, having 10 TMSs.&lt;ref name=Jack&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jack DL, Paulsen IT, Saier MH | title = The amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) superfamily of transporters specific for amino acids, polyamines and organocations | journal = Microbiology | volume = 146 ( Pt 8) | issue = 8 | pages = 1797–814 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10931886 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-146-8-1797 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eukaryotic members of another subfamily ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.3#2.A.3.3 CAT; TC# 2.A.3.3]) and the members of a prokaryotic subfamily ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.11#2.A.3.11 AGT; TC #2.A.3.11]) have 14 TMSs.&lt;ref name=Lorca&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lorca G, Winnen B, Saier MH | title = Identification of the L-aspartate transporter in Bacillus subtilis | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 185 | issue = 10 | pages = 3218–22 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12730183 | pmc = 154055 | doi = 10.1128/jb.185.10.3218-3222.2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger eukaryotic and archaeal proteins possess N- and C-terminal hydrophilic extensions. Some animal proteins, for example, those in the LAT subfamily ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.8#2.A.3.8 TC# 2.A.3.8]) including [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.8.2 ASUR4 (gbY12716)] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.8.3 SPRM1 (gbL25068)] associate with a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein that is essential for insertion or activity of the permease and forms a disulfide bridge with it. These glycoproteins include the CD98 heavy chain protein of ''Mus musculus (gbU25708)'' and the orthologous 4F2 cell surface antigen heavy chain of ''Homo sapiens (spP08195).'' The latter protein is required for the activity of the cystine/glutamate antiporter ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.8.5 2.A.3.8.5]), which maintains cellular redox balance and cysteine/glutathione levels.&lt;ref name="Sato 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sato H, Shiiya A, Kimata M, Maebara K, Tamba M, Sakakura Y, Makino N, Sugiyama F, Yagami K, Moriguchi T, Takahashi S, Bannai S | title = Redox imbalance in cystine/glutamate transporter-deficient mice | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 280 | issue = 45 | pages = 37423–9 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16144837 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.m506439200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are members of the rBAT family of mammalian proteins ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=8.A.9 TC #8.A.9]).

Two APC family members, LAT1 and LAT2 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3.8.7 TC #2.A.3.8.7]), transport a neurotoxicant, the methylmercury-L-cysteine complex, by [[molecular mimicry]].&lt;ref name=SimWillis&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simmons-Willis TA, Koh AS, Clarkson TW, Ballatori N | title = Transport of a neurotoxicant by molecular mimicry: the methylmercury-L-cysteine complex is a substrate for human L-type large neutral amino acid transporter (LAT) 1 and LAT2 | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 367 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 239–46 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12117417 | pmc = 1222880 | doi = 10.1042/bj20020841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seagrass]] bed sediment (soil) is typically anoxic, containing a reduced form of sulfur: [[hydrogen sulfide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S).  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is a phytotoxin that results from [[anaerobic digestion]], the [[decomposition]] of [[organic matter]] in the absence of oxygen.  However, seagrass can persist in this environment because of physiological adaptations, as well as functional adaptations of other organisms in the ecosystem.  For example, bivalves (clams) in the family [[Lucinidae]] host symbiotic bacteria that oxidize sulfides.  Lucinid bivalves' gills house the bacteria, and the siphon supplies the bacteria and surrounding [[pore water]] with oxygenated water from above the sediment.  Bacterial oxidation of the sulfides results in sulfates, reducing toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Lucinid clam influence on the biogeochemistry of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum sediments | author=L.K.

The '''4-Toluene Sulfonate Uptake Permease (TSUP) family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.102 TC# 2.A.102]) is also referred to as the TauE/SafE/YfcA/DUF81 Family.  Although its members have not been rigorously characterized, evidence is available that at least some members function in the transport of sulfur containing organic compounds.  These include 4-toluene sulfonate which may be transported by the TsaS of ''Cupriavidus necator'' (TC# 2.A.102.1.1), sulfolactate which may be exported by the TauE protein of ''Cupriavidus necator'' (TC# 2.A.102.2.1) &lt;ref name=Weinitschke&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinitschke|first1=S|last2=Denger|first2=K|last3=Cook|first3=AM|last4=Smits|first4=TH|title=The DUF81 protein TauE in Cupriavidus necator H16, a sulfite exporter in the metabolism of C2 sulfonates.|journal=Microbiology|date=September 2007|volume=153|issue=9|pages=3055–60|pmid=17768248|doi=10.1099/mic.0.2007/009845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayer|first1=J|last2=Denger|first2=K|last3=Hollemeyer|first3=K|last4=Schleheck|first4=D|last5=Cook|first5=AM|title=(R)-Cysteate-nitrogen assimilation by Cupriavidus necator H16 with excretion of 3-sulfolactate: a patchwork pathway.|journal=Archives of Microbiology|date=November 2012|volume=194|issue=11|pages=949–57|doi=10.1007/s00203-012-0825-y|pmid=22797525|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1239682|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sulfoacetate which may be exported by the SafE1 protein of ''Neptuniibacter caesariensis'' (TC# 2.A.102.2.2).&lt;ref name="Krejcík"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krejcík|first1=Z|last2=Denger|first2=K|last3=Weinitschke|first3=S|last4=Hollemeyer|first4=K|last5=Paces|first5=V|last6=Cook|first6=AM|last7=Smits|first7=TH|title=Sulfoacetate released during the assimilation of taurine-nitrogen by Neptuniibacter caesariensis: purification of sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase.|journal=Archives of Microbiology|date=August 2008|volume=190|issue=2|pages=159–68|doi=10.1007/s00203-008-0386-2|pmid=18506422|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-67590|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another member of the TSUP family, TsaS of ''Comamonas testosteroni'', has been reported to function in the uptake of 4-toluene sulfonate.&lt;ref name=Mampel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mampel|first1=J|last2=Maier|first2=E|last3=Tralau|first3=T|last4=Ruff|first4=J|last5=Benz|first5=R|last6=Cook|first6=AM|title=A novel outer-membrane anion channel (porin) as part of a putatively two-component transport system for 4-toluenesulphonate in Comamonas testosteroni T-2.|journal=Biochemical Journal|date=October 1, 2004|volume=383|issue=1|pages=91–9|pmid=15176949|doi=10.1042/bj20040652|pmc=1134047}}&lt;/ref&gt;  None of these functional assignments can be considered to be certain.&lt;ref name=TCDB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saier|first1=MH Jr.|title=2.A.102.

Members of the '''Alanine or Glycine:Cation Symporter (AGCS) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25 TC# 2.A.25]) transport [[alanine]] and/or [[glycine]] in [[symport]] with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Structure and function==
Known proteins in the AGCS family are between 445 and 550 amino acyl residues in length and possess 8 to 12 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners. Members may possess 11 transmembrane segments (TMSs), as seems to be true for DagA ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25.1.1 TC# 2.A.25.1.1]) and AgcS ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25.1.3 TC# 2.A.25.1.3]), although Acp ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25.1.2 TC# 2.A.25.1.2]) has only 8 TMSs, perhaps the result of truncation. As of early 2016, there does not appear to be any 3D crystal structure data available for these proteins. Members of the AGCS family have been found in bacteria and archaea, such as extremophile halotolerant cyanobacterium ''Aphanothece halophytica,'' and thermophilic bacteria, ''Bacillus'' ''PS3''.&lt;ref name="Bualuang"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bualuang A, Kageyama H, Tanaka Y, Incharoensakdi A, Takabe T | title = Functional characterization of a member of alanine or glycine: cation symporter family in halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica | journal = Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 230–5 | date = 2015 | pmid = 25421789 | doi = 10.1080/09168451.2014.968091 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanamori M, Kamata H, Yagisawa H, Hirata H | title = Overexpression of the alanine carrier protein gene from thermophilic bacterium PS3 in Escherichia coli | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 125 | issue = 3 | pages = 454–9 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10050032 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, only three members of the family have been functionally characterized. These proteins show limited sequence similarity in the APC family ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.3 TC# 2.A.3]).&lt;ref name=TCDB/&gt; As of early 2016, there do not appear to be any crystal structures available for members of the AGCS family.

===Transport reaction===
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by the AGCS family is:&lt;ref name=TCDB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saier|first1=MH | name-list-format = vanc |title=2.A.25 The Alanine or Glycine:Cation Symporter (AGCS) Family|url=http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25|website=Transporter Classification Database|publisher=Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

alanine or glycine (out) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → alanine or glycine (in) + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

==Proteins in the AGCS family==
There are currently 10 proteins belonging to the AGCS family. These proteins and their descriptions can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.25.2 Transporter Classification Database].

==Structure==
Proteins of the NCS2 family are 414–650 amino acyl residues in length and probably possess 14 TMSs. Lu et al. (2011) have concluded from x-ray crystallography that UraA ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.40.1.1 2.A.40.1.1]) has 14 TMSs with two 7 TMS inverted repeats.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lu F, Li S, Jiang Y, Jiang J, Fan H, Lu G, Deng D, Dang S, Zhang X, Wang J, Yan N | title = Structure and mechanism of the uracil transporter UraA | journal = Nature | volume = 472 | issue = 7342 | pages = 243–6 | date = Apr 2011 | pmid = 21423164 | doi = 10.1038/nature09885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Uracil is located at the interface between the two domains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Crystal structures===
Uracil permease, UraA UraA with bound uracil at 2.8Å resolution {{PDB|3QE7}}.

==Transport reaction==
The generalized transport reactions catalyzed by proteins of the NAT/NCS2 family are:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

:Nucleobase (out) H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Nucleobase (in) H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

:Ascorbate (out) Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Ascorbate (in) Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

==Characterized proteins==

      <text bytes="3519" xml:space="preserve">The '''Hydroxy/Aromatic Amino Acid Permease (HAAAP) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42 TC# 2.A.42]) is a member of the large [[APC Superfamily|Amino Acid-Polyamine-OrganoCation (APC) Superfamily]] of secondary carriers. Members of the HAAAP family all function in amino acid uptake. Homologues are present in a large number of [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]], with at least one member classified from archaea ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.1.7 TC# 2.A.42.1.7], ''[[Thermococcus barophilus]]'')''.''

==Structure==
Proteins of the HAAAP family possess 403-443 amino acyl residues and exhibit eleven putative or established transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs).  These proteins exhibit topological features common to the eukaryotic [[AAAP Family|amino acid/auxin permease (AAAP) family]] ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.18 TC# 2.A.18]). These proteins also exhibit limited sequence similarity with some of the AAAP family members. A phylogenetic relationship has been proposed between members of the HAAAP family and APC family since they exhibit limited sequence similarity with one another.

As of early 2016, there is no crystal structural data available for members of the HAAAP family in [[Protein Data Bank|RCSB]].

==Members of the HAAAP Family==
The HAAAP family includes three well-characterized aromatic amino acid:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symport permeases of ''E. coli'': a high affinity tryptophan-specific permease, Mtr ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.1.2 TC# 2.A.42.1.2]), a low affinity tryptophan permease, TnaB ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.1.3 TC# 2.A.42.1.3]), and a tyrosine-specific permease, TyrP ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.1.1 TC# 2.A.42.1.1]), as well as two well-characterized hydroxy amino acid permeases, the serine permease, SdaC ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.2.1 TC# 2.A.42.2.1]), of ''E. coli'', and the threonine permease, TdcC ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.2.2 TC# 2.A.42.2.2]), of ''E. coli''.

SdaC of ''E. coli'' (TC# 2.A.42.2.1) is also called DcrA, and together with a periplasmic protein DcrB (P37620), has been reported to play a role in phage DNA uptake in conjunction with an outer membrane receptor of the OMR family ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.B.14 TC# 1.B.14]). Thus, FhuA (TC #1.B.14.1.4) transports phage T5 DNA while BtuB ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.B.14.3.1 TC# 1.B.14.3.1]) transports phage C1 DNA (Samsonov et al., 2002). DcuB is a putative lipoprotein found only in enteric bacteria.

All members of the HAAAP family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.42.2 Transporter Classification Database].

==Transport Reaction==
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by proteins of the HAAAP family is:

Amino acid (out) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Amino acid (in) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

}} 
The '''Nucleobase:Cation Symporter-1 (NCS1) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39 TC# 2.A.39]) consists of over 1000 currently sequenced proteins derived from [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] bacteria, [[archaea]], fungi and plants. These proteins function as transporters for nucleobases including [[purines]] and [[pyrimidines]]. Members of this family possess twelve transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). At least some of them have been shown to function in uptake by substrate:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symport mechanism.

==Phylogeny==
The bacterial and yeast proteins are widely divergent and do not cluster closely on the NCS1 family phylogenetic tree. ''B. subtilis'' possesses two paralogues of the NCS1 family, and ''S. cerevisiae'' has several. Two of the yeast proteins (Dal4 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.3.1 TC# 2.A.39.3.1]) and Fur4 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.3.2 TC# 2.A.39.3.2])) cluster tightly together. Three other ''S. cerevisiae'' proteins, one of which is the thiamin permease, Thi10 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.4.1 TC# 2.A.39.4.1]), and another of which is the nicotinamide riboside transporter, Nrt1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.4.2 TC# 2.A.39.4.2]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belenky PA, Moga TG, Brenner C | title = Saccharomyces cerevisiae YOR071C encodes the high affinity nicotinamide riboside transporter Nrt1 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 283 | issue = 13 | pages = 8075–9 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18258590 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.C800021200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also cluster tightly together. The latter three proteins are likely to be closely related thiamin permease isoforms. The yeast cytosine-purine and vitamin B6 transporters cluster loosely together (24% identity; e-50).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stolz J, Vielreicher M | title = Tpn1p, the plasma membrane vitamin B6 transporter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 21 | pages = 18990–6 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12649274 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M300949200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacterial proteins are derived from several Gram-negative and Gram-positive species. These proteins exhibit limited sequence similarity with the xanthine permease, PbuX ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.4.1 TC# 2.A.39.4.1]), of ''Bacillus subtilis'' which is a member of the [[Nucleobase cation symporter-2|NCS2 family]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39#ref34543773|title = 2.A.39 The Nucleobase:Cation Symporter-1 (NCS1) Family|date = |access-date = |website = Transporter Classification Database|publisher = Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC|last = Saier|first = MH Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and Function==
Proteins of the NCS1 family are 419-635 amino acyl residues long and possess twelve putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). At least some of them have been shown to function in uptake by substrate:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symport. In these respects, and with respect to substrate specificity, these proteins resemble the symporters of the [[Nucleobase cation symporter-2|NCS2 family]], providing further evidence that the two families represent distant constituents of a single superfamily, the [[APC Superfamily]]. The two families probably arose by an early gene duplication event that occurred long before divergence of the three major kingdoms of life. It is possible that they are distant constituents of the MFS (2.A.1).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The nucleobase-cation-symport-1 (NCS1) transporters are essential components of salvage pathways for [[nucleobase]]s and related metabolites. Weyand et al. (2008) reported the 2.85-angstrom resolution structure of the NCS1 benzyl-hydantoin transporter, Mhp1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.3.6 TC# 2.A.39.3.6]), from ''Microbacterium liquefaciens''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weyand S, Shimamura T, Yajima S, Suzuki S, Mirza O, Krusong K, Carpenter EP, Rutherford NG, Hadden JM, O'Reilly J, Ma P, Saidijam M, Patching SG, Hope RJ, Norbertczak HT, Roach PC, Iwata S, Henderson PJ, Cameron AD | title = Structure and molecular mechanism of a nucleobase-cation-symport-1 family transporter | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5902 | pages = 709–13 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18927357 | pmc = 2885439 | doi = 10.1126/science.1164440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This structure (and related structures) are available through [https://web.archive.org/web/20150418160606/http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do RCSB] ({{PDB|2JLN}}, {{PDB2|2X79}}, {{PDB2|4D1A}}, {{PDB2|4D1B}}, {{PDB2|4D1C}}, {{PDB2|4D1D}}). Mhp1 contains 12 transmembrane helices, 10 of which are arranged in two inverted repeats of five helices. The structures of the outward-facing open and substrate-bound occluded conformations were solved, showing how the outward-facing cavity closes upon binding of substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kazmier K, Sharma S, Islam SM, Roux B, Mchaourab HS | title = Conformational cycle and ion-coupling mechanism of the Na+/hydantoin transporter Mhp1 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 41 | pages = 14752–7 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25267652 | pmc = 4205665 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1410431111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparisons with the leucine transporter LeuT(Aa) and the galactose transporter vSGLT reveal that the outward- and inward-facing cavities are symmetrically arranged on opposite sides of the membrane. The reciprocal opening and closing of these cavities is synchronized by the inverted repeat helices 3 and 8, providing the structural basis of the alternating access model for membrane transport.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Substrates===
NCS1 proteins are H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symporters specific for the uptake of purines, pyrimidines and related metabolites. Krypotou et al. 2015 studied the origin, diversification and substrate specificities of fungal NCS1 transporters, suggesting that the two fungal NCS1 subfamilies, Fur and Fcy, and plant homologues, originated through independent horizontal transfers from prokaryotes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krypotou E, Evangelidis T, Bobonis J, Pittis AA, Gabaldón T, Scazzocchio C, Mikros E, Diallinas G | title = Origin, diversification and substrate specificity in the family of NCS1/FUR transporters | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 927–50 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25712422 | doi = 10.1111/mmi.12982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expansion by gene duplication led to functional diversification of fungal NCS1 porters. They characterized all Fur proteins in Aspergillus nidulans. Homology modelling, substrate docking, molecular dynamics and systematic mutational analysis in three Fur transporters with distinct specificities identified residues critical for function and specificity, located within a major substrate binding site, in transmembrane segments TMS1, TMS3, TMS6 and TMS8. They predicted and confirmed that residues determining substrate specificity are located not only in the major substrate binding site, but also in a putative outward-facing selectivity gate. Their evolutionary and structure-function analyses led to the concept that selective channel-like gates may contribute to substrate specificity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Transport Reaction==
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by NCS1 family permeases is:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

:Nucleobase or Vitamin (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Nucleobase or Vitamin (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)

'''Microbial rhodopsins''', also known as '''bacterial rhodopsins''' are [[Retinylidene protein|retinal-binding proteins]] that provide light-dependent [[ion transport]] and sensory functions in [[Halobacteria|halophilic]]&lt;ref name="OesterheltTittor1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oesterhelt|first1=Dieter|last2=Tittor|first2=Jörg|title=Two pumps, one principle: light-driven ion transport in halobacteria|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|volume=14|issue=2|year=1989|pages=57–61|issn=0968-0004|doi=10.1016/0968-0004(89)90044-3|pmid=2468194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are integral membrane proteins with seven transmembrane helices, the last of which contains the attachment point for [[retinal]] (a conserved lysine).

This protein family includes light-driven [[proton pumps]], [[ion pumps]] and [[ion channels]], as well as light sensors. For example, the proteins from [[halobacteria]] include [[bacteriorhodopsin]] and [[archaerhodopsin]], which are light-driven [[proton pump]]s; [[halorhodopsin]], a light-driven chloride pump; and sensory rhodopsin, which mediates both [[Phototropism|photoattractant]] (in the red) and [[photophobic]] (in the ultra-violet) responses. Proteins from other bacteria include [[proteorhodopsin]].

Contrary to their name, microbial rhodopsins are found not only in [[Archaea]] and [[Bacteria]], but also in [[Eukaryota]] (such as [[algae]]) and [[viruses]]; although they are rare in complex [[multicellular organism]]s.&lt;ref name="BoeufAudic2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boeuf|first1=Dominique|last2=Audic|first2=Stéphane|last3=Brillet-Guéguen|first3=Loraine|last4=Caron|first4=Christophe|last5=Jeanthon|first5=Christian|title=MicRhoDE: a curated database for the analysis of microbial rhodopsin diversity and evolution|journal=Database|volume=2015|year=2015|pages=bav080|url=http://database.oxfordjournals.org/content/2015/bav080.full|issn=1758-0463|doi=10.1093/database/bav080|pmid=26286928|pmc=4539915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YawoKandori2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yawo|first1=Hiromu|last2=Kandori|first2=Hideki|last3=Koizumi|first3=Amane|title=Optogenetics: Light-Sensing Proteins and Their Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5M3WCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=30 September 2015|date=5 June 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-4-431-55516-2|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
'''Rhodopsin''' was originally a synonym for "[[Rhodopsin|visual purple]]", a visual [[Biological pigment|pigment]] (light-sensitive molecule) found in the [[retina]]s of frogs and other [[vertebrate]]s, used for [[Scotopic vision|dim-light vision]], and usually found in [[rod cells]]. This is still the meaning of rhodopsin in the narrow sense, any protein evolutionarily [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to this protein. In a broad non-genetic sense, rhodopsin refers to any molecule, whether related by genetic descent or not (mostly not), consisting of an opsin and a chromophore (generally a variant of retinal). All animal rhodopsins arose (by gene duplication and divergence) late in the history of the large [[G-protein coupled receptor]] (GPCR) gene family, which itself arose after the divergence of plants, fungi, choanflagellates and sponges from the earliest animals. The retinal chromophore is found solely in the opsin branch of this large gene family, meaning its occurrence elsewhere represents convergent evolution, not homology. Microbial rhodopsins are, by sequence, very different from any of the GPCR families.&lt;ref name=pmid21402729&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Nordström KJ, Sällman Almén M, Edstam MM, Fredriksson R, Schiöth HB |title= Independent HHsearch, Needleman—Wunsch-based, and motif analyses reveal the overall hierarchy for most of the G protein-coupled receptor families |journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume= 28 |issue= 9 |pages= 2471–80 |date= September 2011 |pmid= 21402729 |doi= 10.1093/molbev/msr061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''bacterial rhodopsin''' originally referred to the first microbial rhodopsin discovered, known today as [[bacteriorhodopsin]].

==The Ion-Translocating Microbial Rhodopsin Family==
The '''Ion-translocating Microbial Rhodopsin (MR) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.E.1 TC# 3.E.1]) is a member of the [[TOG Superfamily]] of secondary carriers. Members of the MR family [[Catalysis|catalyze]] light-driven ion translocation across microbial cytoplasmic membranes or serve as light receptors. Most proteins of the MR family are all of about the same size (250-350 amino acyl residues) and possess seven [[Transmembrane domain|transmembrane]] helical spanners with their [[N-terminus|N-termini]] on the outside and their [[C-terminus|C-termini]] on the inside. There are 9 subfamilies in the MR family:&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.E.1#ref9955|title = 3.E.1 The Ion-translocating Microbial Rhodopsin (MR) Family|date = |access-date = |website = Transporter Classification Database|publisher = Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC|last = Saier|first = MH Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Function===
The association of sensory rhodopsins with their transducer proteins appears to determine whether they function as transporters or receptors. Association of a sensory rhodopsin receptor with its transducer occurs via the transmembrane helical domains of the two interacting proteins. There are two sensory rhodopsins in any one halophilic archaeon, one (SRI) that responds positively to orange light but negatively to blue light, the other (SRII) that responds only negatively to blue light. Each transducer is specific for its cognate receptor. An x-ray structure of SRII complexed with its transducer (HtrII) at 1.94 Å resolution is available ({{PDB2|1H2S}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Molecular basis of transmembrane signalling by sensory rhodopsin II-transducer complex|journal = Nature|date = 2002-10-03|issn = 0028-0836|pmid = 12368857|pages = 484–487|volume = 419|issue = 6906|doi = 10.1038/nature01109|first = Valentin I.|last = Gordeliy|first2 = Jörg|last2 = Labahn|first3 = Rouslan|last3 = Moukhametzianov|first4 = Rouslan|last4 = Efremov|first5 = Joachim|last5 = Granzin|first6 = Ramona|last6 = Schlesinger|first7 = Georg|last7 = Büldt|first8 = Tudor|last8 = Savopol|first9 = Axel J.|last9 = Scheidig}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Molecular and evolutionary aspects of the light-signal transduction by microbial sensory receptors have been reviewed.&lt;ref name="Inoue 562–577"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Molecular and evolutionary aspects of microbial sensory rhodopsins|journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date = 2014-05-01|issn = 0006-3002|pmid = 23732219|pages = 562–577|volume = 1837|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.bbabio.2013.05.005|first = Keiichi|last = Inoue|first2 = Takashi|last2 = Tsukamoto|first3 = Yuki|last3 = Sudo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the MR family homologues in yeast and fungi are of about the same size and topology as the archaeal proteins (283-344 amino acyl residues; 7 putative transmembrane α-helical segments), but they are heat shock- and toxic solvent-induced proteins of unknown biochemical function. They have been suggested to function as pmf-driven chaperones that fold extracellular proteins, but only indirect evidence supports this postulate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The MR family is distantly related to the 7 TMS [[Lysosomal cystine transporter family|LCT family]] ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.43 TC# 2.A.43]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Representative members of MR family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.E.1.8 Transporter Classification Database].

===Bacteriorhodopsins and Halorhodopsins===

Bacterio- and halorhodopsins pump 1 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; per photon absorbed, respectively. Specific transport mechanisms and pathways have been proposed.&lt;ref name="Kolbe 1390–1396"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mechanism of proton transport in bacteriorhodopsin from crystallographic structures of the K, L, M1, M2, and M2' intermediates of the photocycle|journal = Journal of Molecular Biology|date = 2003-04-25|issn = 0022-2836|pmid = 12691752|pages = 439–450|volume = 328|issue = 2|first = Janos K.|last = Lanyi|first2 = Brigitte|last2 = Schobert|doi=10.1016/s0022-2836(03)00263-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Crystallographic structures of the M and N intermediates of bacteriorhodopsin: assembly of a hydrogen-bonded chain of water molecules between Asp-96 and the retinal Schiff base|journal = Journal of Molecular Biology|date = 2003-07-11|issn = 0022-2836|pmid = 12842471|pages = 553–570|volume = 330|issue = 3|first = Brigitte|last = Schobert|first2 = Leonid S.|last2 = Brown|first3 = Janos K.|last3 = Lanyi|doi=10.1016/s0022-2836(03)00576-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism involves:

# photo-isomerization of the retinal and its initial configurational changes,
# deprotonation of the retinal Schiff base and the coupled release of a proton to the extracellular membrane surface,
# the switch event that allows reprotonation of the Schiff base from the cytoplasmic side.

Six structural models describe the transformations of the retinal and its interaction with water 402, Asp85, and Asp212 in atomic detail, as well as the displacements of functional residues farther from the [[Schiff base]]. The changes provide rationales for how relaxation of the distorted retinal causes movements of water and protein atoms that result in vectorial proton transfers to and from the Schiff base.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Helix deformation is coupled to vectorial proton transport in the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Helix deformation is coupled to vectorial proton transport in the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin|journal = Nature|date = 2000-08-10|issn = 0028-0836|pmid = 10949307|pages = 645–648|volume = 406|issue = 6796|doi = 10.1038/35020599|first = A.|last = Royant|first2 = K.|last2 = Edman|first3 = T.|last3 = Ursby|first4 = E.|last4 = Pebay-Peyroula|first5 = E.

Most residues participating in the trimerization are not conserved in bacteriorhodopsin, a homologous protein capable of forming a trimeric structure in the absence of bacterioruberin. Despite a large alteration in the amino acid sequence, the shape of the intratrimer hydrophobic space filled by lipids is highly conserved between archaerhodopsin-2 and bacteriorhodopsin. Since a transmembrane helix facing this space undergoes a large conformational change during the proton pumping cycle, it is feasible that trimerization is an important strategy to capture special lipid components that are relevant to the protein activity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Structural role of bacterioruberin in the trimeric structure of archaerhodopsin-2|journal = Journal of Molecular Biology|date = 2008-02-01|issn = 1089-8638|pmid = 18082767|pages = 1267–1281|volume = 375|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2007.11.039|first = Keiko|last = Yoshimura|first2 = Tsutomu|last2 = Kouyama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine Bacterial Rhodopsin===

A marine bacterial rhodopsin has been reported to function as a proton pump. However, it also resembles sensory rhodopsin II of archaea as well as an Orf from the fungus ''Leptosphaeria maculans'' (AF290180). These proteins exhibit 20-30% identity with each other.

===Channelrhodopsins===

[[Channelrhodopsin]]-1 (ChR1) or channelopsin-1 (Chop1; Cop3; CSOA) of ''C. reinhardtii'' is closely related to the archaeal sensory rhodopsins. It has 712 aas with a signal peptide, followed by a short amphipathic region, and then a hydrophobic N-terminal domain with seven probable TMSs (residues 76-309) followed by a long hydrophilic C-terminal domain of about 400 residues. Part of the C-terminal hydrophilic domain is homologous to intersectin (EH and SH3 domain protein 1A) of animals (AAD30271).

Chop1 serves as a light-gated proton channel and mediates phototaxis and photophobic responses in green algae.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Based on this phenotype, Chop1 could be assigned to [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A TC category #1.A], but because it belongs to a family in which well-characterized homologues catalyze active ion transport, it is assigned to the MR family. Expression of the ''chop1'' gene, or a truncated form of that gene encoding only the hydrophobic core (residues 1-346 or 1-517) in frog oocytes in the presence of all-trans retinal produces a light-gated conductance that shows characteristics of a channel passively but selectively permeable to protons. This channel activity probably generates bioelectric currents.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A homologue of ChR1 in ''C. reinhardtii'' is channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2; Chop2; Cop4; CSOB). This protein is 57% identical, 10% similar to ChR1. It forms a cation-selective ion channel activated by light absorption. It transports both monovalent and divalent cations. It desensitizes to a small conductance in continuous light. Recovery from desensitization is accelerated by extracellular H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and a negative membrane potential. It may be a photoreceptor for dark adapted cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Channelrhodopsin-2, a directly light-gated cation-selective membrane channel|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2003-11-25|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 283525|pmid = 14615590|pages = 13940–13945|volume = 100|issue = 24|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1936192100|first = Georg|last = Nagel|first2 = Tanjef|last2 = Szellas|first3 = Wolfram|last3 = Huhn|first4 = Suneel|last4 = Kateriya|first5 = Nona|last5 = Adeishvili|first6 = Peter|last6 = Berthold|first7 = Doris|last7 = Ollig|first8 = Peter|last8 = Hegemann|first9 = Ernst|last9 = Bamberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transient increase in hydration of transmembrane α-helices with a t(1/2) = 60 μs tallies with the onset of cation permeation. Aspartate 253 accepts the proton released by the Schiff base (t(1/2) = 10 μs), with the latter being reprotonated by aspartic acid 156 (t(1/2) = 2 ms). The internal proton acceptor and donor groups, corresponding to D212 and D115 in bacteriorhodopsin, are clearly different from other microbial rhodopsins, indicating that their spatial positions in the protein were relocated during evolution. E90 deprotonates exclusively in the nonconductive state. The observed proton transfer reactions and the protein conformational changes relate to the gating of the cation channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transient protonation changes in channelrhodopsin-2 and their relevance to channel gating|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2013-04-02|issn = 1091-6490|pmc = 3619329|pmid = 23509282|pages = E1273–1281|volume = 110|issue = 14|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1219502110|first = Víctor A.|last = Lórenz-Fonfría|first2 = Tom|last2 = Resler|first3 = Nils|last3 = Krause|first4 = Melanie|last4 = Nack|first5 = Michael|last5 = Gossing|first6 = Gabriele|last6 = Fischer von Mollard|first7 = Christian|last7 = Bamann|first8 = Ernst|last8 = Bamberg|first9 = Ramona|last9 = Schlesinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaerhodopsin===

Archaerhodopsin-2 (aR2) was found in the claret membrane of ''Halorubrum sp''. It is a light-driven proton pump. Trigonal and hexagonal crystals revealed that trimers are arranged on a honeycomb lattice.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In these crystals, the carotenoid bacterioruberin binds to crevices between the subunits of the trimer. Its polyene chain is inclined from the membrane normal by an angle of about 20 degrees and, on the cytoplasmic side, it is surrounded by helices AB and DE of neighboring subunits. This peculiar binding mode suggests that bacterioruberin plays a structural role for the trimerization of aR2. When compared with the aR2 structure in another crystal form containing no bacterioruberin, the proton release channel takes a more closed conformation in the P321 or P6(3) crystal; i.e., the native conformation of protein is stabilized in the trimeric protein-bacterioruberin complex.

==Transport Reaction==
The generalized transport reaction for bacterio- and sensory rhodopsins is:&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) + hν → H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out).

That for halorhodopsin is:

:Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (out) + hν → Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

The '''Nicotinamide Ribonucleoside (NR) Uptake Permease (PnuC) Family''' ([http://tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=4.B.1 TC# 4.B.1]) is a family of transmembrane transporters that is part of the [[TOG superfamily]].&lt;ref name="Yee_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yee DC, Shlykov MA, Västermark A, Reddy VS, Arora S, Sun EI, Saier MH | title = The transporter-opsin-G protein-coupled receptor (TOG) superfamily | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 280 | issue = 22 | pages = 5780–800 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23981446 | pmc = 3832197 | doi = 10.1111/febs.12499 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Close PnuC homologues are found in a wide range of [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="TCB"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=4.B.1#ref3139|title = 4.B.1 The Nicotinamide Ribonucleoside (NR) Uptake Permease (PnuC) Family|date = |access-date = |website = Transporter Classification Database|publisher = Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC|last = Saier|first = MH Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
PnuC of ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' are believed to function cooperatively with NadR homologues, multifunctional proteins that together with PnuC, participate in NR [[phosphorylation]], transport and [[transcriptional regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Foster JW, Park YK, Penfound T, Fenger T, Spector MP | title = Regulation of NAD metabolism in Salmonella typhimurium: molecular sequence analysis of the bifunctional nadR regulator and the nadA-pnuC operon | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 172 | issue = 8 | pages = 4187–96 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2198247 | pmc = 213241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merdanovic_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Merdanovic M, Sauer E, Reidl J | title = Coupling of NAD+ biosynthesis and nicotinamide ribosyl transport: characterization of NadR ribonucleotide kinase mutants of Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 187 | issue = 13 | pages = 4410–20 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15968050 | pmc = 1151767 | doi = 10.1128/JB.187.13.4410-4420.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Penfound T, Foster JW | title = NAD-dependent DNA-binding activity of the bifunctional NadR regulator of Salmonella typhimurium | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 181 | issue = 2 | pages = 648–55 | date = January 1999 | pmid = 9882682 | pmc = 93422 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NadR, a cytoplasmic protein that is partly membrane associated, contains one well conserved and one poorly conserved mononucleotide-binding [[consensus sequence]] (G-X4 GKS). It drives transport and may render transport responsive to internal pyridine nucleotide levels. While its N-terminal half functions as a repressor, its C-terminal half functions as an NR kinase in a putative group translocation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitchell P, Moyle J | title = Group-translocation: a consequence of enzyme-catalysed group-transfer | journal = Nature | volume = 182 | issue = 4632 | pages = 372–3 | date = August 1958 | pmid = 13577842 | doi = 10.1038/182372a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PnuC of ''Haemophilus influenzae''===
The ''H. influenzae'' homologue has been shown to transport NR from the periplasm into the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of NR by NadR is required for NR uptake. The ribonucleoside [[kinase]] (RNK) domain has both [[Walker A motif|Walker A]] and [[Walker motifs|Walker B motifs]], responsible for ATP binding and phosphoryl transfer. In addition, a proposed LID domain was identified in RNK. LID domains have been found in other kinases, and these domains are regions which are able to move after substrate binding. They are responsible for coordination of three distinct conformations, an open state in the absence of substrate, a partially closed state after substrate binding, and a fully closed state when both substrates are present.

In ''H. influenzae'', NR enters the [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] resynthesis pathway after [[phosphorylation]] to NMN, and subsequently, NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is synthesized from NMN and ATP via an NMN adenylyl transferase activity.&lt;ref name="Kurnasov 6906–6917"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cynamon MH, Sorg TB, Patapow A | title = Utilization and metabolism of NAD by Haemophilus parainfluenzae | journal = Journal of General Microbiology | volume = 134 | issue = 10 | pages = 2789–99 | date = October 1988 | pmid = 3254936 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-134-10-2789 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NadR represents a multifunctional regulator/enzyme complex able to integrate several functions, such as enzymatic catalysis, transport, and transcriptional regulatory activities.

==Other constituents required for uptake==
The components of the ''H. influenzae'' pathway necessary for NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NMN, and NR uptake have been determined. Merdanovic et al. characterized two enzymes, an outer membrane nucleotide phosphatase, and an NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; nucleotidase (NadN) located in the periplasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kemmer G, Reilly TJ, Schmidt-Brauns J, Zlotnik GW, Green BA, Fiske MJ, Herbert M, Kraiss A, Schlör S, Smith A, Reidl J | title = NadN and e (P4) are essential for utilization of NAD and nicotinamide mononucleotide but not nicotinamide riboside in Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 183 | issue = 13 | pages = 3974–81 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11395461 | pmc = 95280 | doi = 10.1128/JB.183.13.3974-3981.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reidl J, Schlör S, Kraiss A, Schmidt-Brauns J, Kemmer G, Soleva E | title = NADP and NAD utilization in Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 1573–81 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10760156 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01829.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt-Brauns J, Herbert M, Kemmer G, Kraiss A, Schlör S, Reidl J | title = Is a NAD pyrophosphatase activity necessary for Haemophilus influenzae type b multiplication in the blood stream? | journal = International Journal of Medical Microbiology | volume = 291 | issue = 3 | pages = 219–25 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11554562 | doi = 10.1078/1438-4221-00122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NMN cross the outer membrane mainly via the OmpP2 porin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen C, Maier E, Kemmer G, Blass J, Hilpert AK, Benz R, Reidl J | title = Porin OmpP2 of Haemophilus influenzae shows specificity for nicotinamide-derived nucleotide substrates | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 27 | pages = 24269–76 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12695515 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M213087200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only NR can be utilized by the PnuC transport system located in the inner membrane.&lt;ref name="Herbert_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herbert M, Sauer E, Smethurst G, Kraiss A, Hilpert AK, Reidl J | title = Nicotinamide ribosyl uptake mutants in Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 71 | issue = 9 | pages = 5398–401 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 12933892 | pmc = 187334 | doi = 10.1128/iai.71.9.5398-5401.2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sauer E, Merdanovic M, Mortimer AP, Bringmann G, Reidl J | title = PnuC and the utilization of the nicotinamide riboside analog 3-aminopyridine in Haemophilus influenzae | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 48 | issue = 12 | pages = 4532–41 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15561822 | pmc = 529221 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.48.12.4532-4541.2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''pnuC'' gene product is the protein that is responsible for the main flow of the NR substrate into the cytoplasm. The study of Merdanovic et al. suggests that the RNK activity of NadR determines NR transport and is negatively regulated by cytoplasmic NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; feedback inhibition. Therefore, NR uptake is under NadR feedback control.&lt;ref name="Merdanovic_2005" /&gt;

ATP, not the [[proton motive force]], appears to be required for NR uptake. Thus, the driving force for NR uptake via PnuC is NR phosphorylation by NadR. A concerted group translocation mechanism can be considered whereby NadR facilitates the dissociation of NR from PnuC by phosphorylating it to NMN, thus preventing efflux of NR.

===Transport reaction===
The proposed transport reaction catalyzed by PnuC and NadR is:&lt;ref name="TCB" /&gt;

NR (out) + ATP (in) → NMN (in) + ADP (in).

== Structure ==
PnuC of ''[[Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica|Salmonella typhimurium]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' are [[integral membrane protein]]s, 239 and 226 amino acyl residues (aas) in length, respectively, with 7 putative [[Transmembrane domain|transmembrane]] [[Alpha helix|α-helical segments]].

The structure of NadR has been determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh SK, Kurnasov OV, Chen B, Robinson H, Grishin NV, Osterman AL, Zhang H | title = Crystal structure of Haemophilus influenzae NadR protein.

'''Natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins''' (NRAMPs) are members of the '''metal ion (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-iron) transporter family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.55 TC# 2.A.55]). The NRAMP family is a member of the large [[APC Superfamily]] of secondary carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vastermark A, Wollwage S, Houle ME, Rio R, Saier MH | title = Expansion of the APC superfamily of secondary carriers | journal = Proteins | volume = 82 | issue = 10 | pages = 2797–811 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25043943 | pmc = 4177346 | doi = 10.1002/prot.24643 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homologues of this family are found in various [[yeast]]s, [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[archaea]], and [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]] termed "natural resistance-associated" [[macrophage]] proteins because one of the animal homologues plays a role in resistance to intracellular bacterial [[pathogen]]s such as ''[https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Salmonella_enterica_serovar_Typhi Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium]'', ''[[Leishmania donovani]]'' and ''[[Mycobacterium bovis]]''.

==NRAMP2==
{{Main|DMT1}}
Humans and rodents possess two distinct NRAMPs. The broad specificity NRAMP2 (DMT1), which transports a range of divalent metal cations, transports Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with a 1:1 stoichiometry and apparent affinities of 6 μm and about 1 μm, respectively. Variable H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stoichiometry has also been reported. The order of substrate preference for NRAMP2 is:

Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;

Many of these ions can inhibit iron absorption. Mutation of NRAMP2 in rodents leads to defective [[Endosome|endosomal]] iron export within the ferritin cycle, impaired intestinal iron absorption and [[microcytic anemia]]. Symptoms of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deficiency are also seen. It is found in apical membranes of intestinal epithelial cells but also in late [[endosome]]s and [[lysosome]]s.

==NRAMP1==
{{Main|SLC11A1}}
In contrast to the widely expressed NRAMP2, NRAMP1 is expressed primarily in [[macrophage]]s and [[monocyte]]s and appears to have a preference for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rather than Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. NRAMP1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.55.2.3 TC# 2.A.55.2.3]) has been reported to function by metal:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Techau ME, Valdez-Taubas J, Popoff JF, Francis R, Seaman M, Blackwell JM | title = Evolution of differences in transport function in Slc11a family members | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 282 | issue = 49 | pages = 35646–56 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17932044 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M707057200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that a deficiency for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or some other metal prevents the generation of reactive oxygenic and nitrogenic compounds that are used by macrophage to combat pathogens. This hypothesis is supported by studies on the bacterial NRAMP homologues which exhibit extremely high selectivity for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; over Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and other divalent cations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wei W, Chai T, Zhang Y, Han L, Xu J, Guan Z | title = The Thlaspi caerulescens NRAMP homologue TcNRAMP3 is capable of divalent cation transport | journal = Molecular Biotechnology | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18663607 | doi = 10.1007/s12033-008-9088-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation of these transporters in bacteria can occur through Fur, OxyR, and most commonly a DtxR homolog, MntR.

==Smf and other homologues==
The Smf1 protein of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' appears to catalyze high-affinity (''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.3 μm) Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake while the closely related Smf2 protein may catalyze low affinity (''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 60 μm) Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake in the same organism. Both proteins also mediate H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake. These proteins are of 575 and 549 amino acyl residues in length and are predicted to have 8-12 transmembrane α-helical spanners. The ''E. coli'' homologue of 412 aas exhibits 11 putative and confirmed TMSs with the N-terminus in and the C-terminus out. The yeast proteins may be localized to the vacuole and/or the plasma membrane of the yeast cell. Indirect and some direct experiments suggest that they may be able to transport several heavy metals including Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. A third yeast protein, Smf3p, appears to be exclusively intracellular, possibly in the Golgi. NRAMP2 (''[[SLC11A2|Slc11A2]]'') of Homo sapiens ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.55.2.1 TC# 2.A.55.2.1]) has a 12 TMS topology with intracellular N- and C-termini. Two-fold structural symmetry in the arrangement of membrane helices for TM1-5 and TM6-10 (conserved Slc2 hydrophobic core) is suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Czachorowski M, Lam-Yuk-Tseung S, Cellier M, Gros P | title = Transmembrane topology of the mammalian Slc11a2 iron transporter | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 48 | issue = 35 | pages = 8422–34 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19621945 | pmc = 2736113 | doi = 10.1021/bi900606y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport reaction==
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by NRAMP family proteins is:

Me&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) ⇌ Me&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

The '''Formate-Nitrite Transporter (FNT) Family''' belongs to the [[Major intrinsic proteins|Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP) Superfamily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reizer J, Reizer A, Saier MH | title = The MIP family of integral membrane channel proteins: sequence comparisons, evolutionary relationships, reconstructed pathway of evolution, and proposed functional differentiation of the two repeated halves of the proteins | journal = Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 235–57 | date = 1993-01-01 | pmid = 8325040 | doi = 10.3109/10409239309086796 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Park JH, Saier MH | title = Phylogenetic characterization of the MIP family of transmembrane channel proteins | journal = The Journal of Membrane Biology | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 171–80 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8849412 | doi = 10.1007/s002329900120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FNT family members have been sequenced from [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[yeast]], plants and lower eukaryotes. The [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] proteins of the FNT family probably function in the transport of the structurally related compounds, [[formate]] and [[nitrite]].&lt;ref name="pmid8022272"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suppmann B, Sawers G | title = Isolation and characterization of hypophosphite--resistant mutants of Escherichia coli: identification of the FocA protein, encoded by the pfl operon, as a putative formate transporter | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 965–82 | date = March 1994 | pmid = 8022272 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1994.tb00375.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
With the exception of the yeast protein (627 amino acyl residues), all characterized members of the family are of 256-285 residues in length and exhibit 6-8 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). In one case, that of the ''E. coli'' FocA ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.1 TC# 1.A.16.1.1]) protein, a 6 TMS topology has been established.&lt;ref name = "Wang_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Y, Huang Y, Wang J, Cheng C, Huang W, Lu P, Xu YN, Wang P, Yan N, Shi Y | title = Structure of the formate transporter FocA reveals a pentameric aquaporin-like channel | journal = Nature | volume = 462 | issue = 7272 | pages = 467–72 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19940917 | doi = 10.1038/nature08610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The yeast protein has a similar apparent topology but has a large C-terminal hydrophilic extension of about 400 residues.

FocA of ''E. coli'' is a symmetriv [[pentamer]], with each subunit consisting of six TMSs.&lt;ref name = "Wang_2009" /&gt;

== Phylogeny ==
The phylogenetic tree shows clustering according to function and organismal phylogeny. The putative formate efflux transporters (FocA; TC#s [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.1 1.A.16.1.1] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.1.3 1.A.16.1.3]) of bacteria associated with pyruvate-formate lyase (pfl) comprise cluster I; the putative formate uptake permeases (FdhC; TC#s [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.1 1.A.16.2.1] and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.3 1.A.16.2.3]) of bacteria and archaea associated with formate dehydrogenase comprise cluster II; the nitrite uptake permeases (NirC, TC#s [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.5 1.A.16.2.5], [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.3.1 1.A.16.3.1], and [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16.2.4 1.A.16.3.4]) of bacteria comprise cluster III, and a yeast protein comprises cluster IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.A.16#ref9123|title = 1.A.16 The Formate-Nitrite Transporter (FNT) Family|date = |access-date = |website = Transporter Classification Database|publisher = Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC|last = Saier|first = MH Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
The energy coupling mechanisms for proteins of the FNT family have not been extensively characterized. HCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} and NO{{su|b=2|p=−}} uptakes may be coupled to H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symport. HCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} efflux may be driven by the membrane potential by a uniport mechanism or by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport. FocA of ''E. coli'' catalyzes bidirectional [[formate]] transport and may function by a channel-type mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falke D, Schulz K, Doberenz C, Beyer L, Lilie H, Thiemer B, Sawers RG | title = Unexpected oligomeric structure of the FocA formate channel of Escherichia coli : a paradigm for the formate-nitrite transporter family of integral membrane proteins | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 303 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–75 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20041954 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01862.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FocA, transports short-chain acids. FocA may be able to switch its mode of operation from a passive export channel at high external pH to a secondary active formate/H+ importer at low pH. The crystal structure of ''[[Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica|Salmonella typhimurium]]'' FocA at pH 4.0 shows that this switch involves a major rearrangement of the amino termini of individual protomers in the pentameric channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lü W, Du J, Wacker T, Gerbig-Smentek E, Andrade SL, Einsle O | title = pH-dependent gating in a FocA formate channel | journal = Science | volume = 332 | issue = 6027 | pages = 352–4 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21493860 | doi = 10.1126/science.1199098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amino-terminal helices open or block transport in a concerted, cooperative action that indicates how FocA is gated in a pH-dependent way. Electrophysiological studies show that the protein acts as a specific formate channel at pH 7.0 and that it closes upon a shift of pH to 5.1.

=== Transport Reaction ===
The probable transport reactions catalyzed by different members of the FNT family are:

(1) RCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} or NO{{su|b=2|p=−}} (out) ⇌ RCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} or NO{{su|b=2|p=−}} (in),

(2) HCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} (in) ⇌ HCO{{su|b=2|p=−}} (out),

(3) HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (out) ⇌ HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

== Members ==

== The Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) Family ==
The CDF family (TC# [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.4 2.A.4]) is a ubiquitous family, members of which are found in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A novel family of ubiquitous heavy metal ion transport proteins.|last = Paulson|first = IT|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Membrane Biology|doi = |pmid = 9075641|last2 = Saier|first2 = MH Jr.|issue = 2|volume = 156|pages = 99–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; They transport heavy metal ions, such as [[cadmium]], [[zinc]], [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[copper]] and mercuric ions.

=== Phylogeny ===
Prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins cluster separately but may function with the same polarity by similar mechanisms. These proteins are secondary carriers which utilize the proton motive force (pmf) and function by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport (for metal efflux). One member, CzcD of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.4.1.3 TC# 2.A.4.1.3]) '','' has been shown to exchange the divalent cation (Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ) for two monovalent cations (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ) in an electroneutral process energized by the transmembrane pH gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An antiport mechanism for a member of the cation diffusion facilitator family: divalent cations efflux in exchange for K+ and H+|journal = Molecular Microbiology|date = 2002-07-01|issn = 0950-382X|pmid = 12100555|pages = 145–153|volume = 45|issue = 1|first = Arthur A.|last = Guffanti|first2 = Yi|last2 = Wei|first3 = Sacha V.|last3 = Rood|first4 = Terry A.|last4 = Krulwich|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02998.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, ZitB of ''E. coli'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.4.1.4 TC #2.A.4.1.4]), has been reconstituted in proteoliposomes and studied kinetically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Kinetic study of the antiport mechanism of an Escherichia coli zinc transporter, ZitB|journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date = 2004-03-26|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 14715669|pages = 12043–12050|volume = 279|issue = 13|doi = 10.1074/jbc.M313510200|first = Yang|last = Chao|first2 = Dax|last2 = Fu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears to function by simple Me&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport with a 1:1 stoichiometry.

Montanini et al. (2007) have conducted phylogenetic analysis of CDF family members. Their analysis revealed three major and two minor phylogenetic groups. They suggest that the three major groups segregated according to metal ion specificity:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Phylogenetic and functional analysis of the Cation Diffusion Facilitator (CDF) family: improved signature and prediction of substrate specificity|journal = BMC Genomics|date = 2007-01-01|issn = 1471-2164|pmc = 1868760|pmid = 17448255|pages = 107|volume = 8|doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-8-107|first = Barbara|last = Montanini|first2 = Damien|last2 = Blaudez|first3 = Sylvain|last3 = Jeandroz|first4 = Dale|last4 = Sanders|first5 = Michel|last5 = Chalot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; 
# Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as well as other metal ions 
# Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; plus other metals, but not Iron.

=== Structure ===
X-ray structure of YiiP of ''E. coli'' represents a homodimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Oligomeric state of the Escherichia coli metal transporter YiiP|journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date = 2004-09-17|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 15258151|pages = 39251–39259|volume = 279|issue = 38|doi = 10.1074/jbc.M407044200|first = Yinan|last = Wei|first2 = Huilin|last2 = Li|first3 = Dax|last3 = Fu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Structure of the zinc transporter YiiP|journal = Science|date = 2007-09-21|issn = 1095-9203|pmid = 17717154|pages = 1746–1748|volume = 317|issue = 5845|doi = 10.1126/science.1143748|first = Min|last = Lu|first2 = Dax|last2 = Fu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coudray et al. (2013) used cryoelectron microscopy to determine a 13 Å resolution structure of a YiiP homolog from ''[[Shewanella oneidensis]]'' within a lipid bilayer in the absence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Starting from the x-ray structure in the presence of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, they used molecular dynamic flexible fitting to build a model. Comparison of the structures suggested a conformational change that involves pivoting of a transmembrane, four-helix bundle (M1, M2, M4, and M5) relative to the M3-M6 helix pair. Although accessibility of transport sites in the x-ray model indicates that it represents an outward-facing state, their model was consistent with an inward-facing state, suggesting that the conformational change is relevant to the alternating access mechanism for transport. They speculated that the dimer may coordinate rearrangement of the transmembrane helices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inward-facing conformation of the zinc transporter YiiP revealed by cryoelectron microscopy|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2013-02-05|issn = 1091-6490|pmc = 3568326|pmid = 23341604|pages = 2140–2145|volume = 110|issue = 6|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1215455110|first = Nicolas|last = Coudray|first2 = Salvatore|last2 = Valvo|first3 = Minghui|last3 = Hu|first4 = Ralph|last4 = Lasala|first5 = Changki|last5 = Kim|first6 = Martin|last6 = Vink|first7 = Ming|last7 = Zhou|first8 = Davide|last8 = Provasi|first9 = Marta|last9 = Filizola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Involved in metal tolerance/resistance by efflux, most CDF proteins share a two-modular architecture consisting of a [[transmembrane domain]] (TMD) and a [[C-terminus|C-terminal domain]] (CTD) that protrudes into the cytoplasm. A Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; CDF transporter from the marine bacterium, ''Maricaulis maris,'' that does not possess the CTD is a member of a new, CTD-lacking subfamily of CDFs.

=== Transport Reaction ===
The generalized transport reaction for CDF family members is:

Me&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) ± K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Me&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) ± K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

A '''biologist''' is a professional who has specialized knowledge in the field of [[biology]], understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern the functioning of biological systems within fields such as [[health]], [[technology]] and the [[Biophysical environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/biology|title=the definition of biology|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists involved in fundamental research attempt to explore and further explain the underlying mechanisms that govern the functioning of living matter. Biologists involved in applied research attempt to develop or improve more specific processes and understanding, in fields such as [[medicine]] and [[industry]].

Biologists are interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern the functioning of living matter as well as the complex properties that emerge from the biophysical, biochemical, cellular and systemic interactions of [[Organism|living systems]]. Biologists conduct research using the [[scientific method]] to test the validity of a theory in a rational, unbiased and reproducible manner. This consists of [[hypothesis]] formation, [[experiment]]ation and [[data analysis]] to establish the validity or invalidity of a scientific theory.

There are different types of biologists. [[Theoretical Biology|Theoretical biologists]] use mathematical methods and develop [[Mathematical model|models]] to understand  phenomena and ideally predict future experimental results, while [[Experimental biology|experimental biologists]] conceive experiments to test those predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-12-07|title=On the origin of non-membrane-bound organelles, and their physiological function|url=|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=434|pages=42–49|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.04.006|pmid=28392184|pmc=5630510|issn=0022-5193|last1=Stroberg|first1=Wylie|last2=Schnell|first2=Santiago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Biology, Principles of Genome Function|last=Craig|first=Nancy|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=9780199658572|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some biologists work on [[Microorganism|microorganisms]], while others study [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]] organisms (including [[Homo sapiens|humans]]). Some investigate the nano or micro-scale, others emergent properties such as [[Ecology|ecological interactions]] or [[Neuroscience|cognition]]. There is much overlap between different fields of biology (e.g. [[zoology]], [[microbiology]], [[genetics]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) and due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field it is often difficult to classify a life scientist as only one of them. Many biological scientists work in research and development. Some conduct fundamental research to advance human knowledge of life. Furthermore, applied biological research often aids the development of solutions to problems in areas such as human health and the natural environment. Biological scientists mostly work in government, university, and private industry [[Laboratory|laboratories]].

==Research==
[[File:Mwb in lab-2.jpg|thumb|[[Martinus Willem Beijerinck]], a botanist and microbiologist]]
Biologists who work in basic research formulate theories and devise experiments to advance human knowledge on life including topics such as [[evolution]], [[biochemistry]], [[molecular biology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[cell biology]].

Biological scientists who work in applied research use instead the accomplishments gained by basic research to further knowledge in particular fields or applications. For example, this applied research may be used to develop new [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, treatments and medical [[diagnostic test]]s. Biological scientists conducting applied research and product development in private industry may be required to describe their research plans or results to non-scientists who are in a position to veto or approve their ideas. These scientists must consider the business effects of their work.

While theoretical biologists usually work in "dry" labs, formulating mathematical models and running computer simulations, some experimental biologists conduct laboratory experiments involving [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Microorganism|microorganisms]] or [[Biomolecule|biomolecules]]. However, a small part of experimental biological research also occurs outside the laboratory and may involve natural observation rather than experimentation. For example, a botanist may investigate the plant species present in a particular environment, while an ecologist might study how a forest area recovers after a fire.

Swift advances in knowledge of genetics and organic molecules spurred growth in the field of biotechnology, transforming the industries in which biological scientists work. Biological scientists can now manipulate the genetic material of animals and plants, attempting to make organisms (including humans) more productive or resistant to disease. Basic and applied research on biotechnological processes, such as recombining DNA, has led to the production of important substances, including human insulin and growth hormone. Many other substances not previously available in large quantities are now produced by biotechnological means. Some of these substances are useful in treating diseases.

Those working on various genome (chromosomes with their associated genes) projects isolate genes and determine their function. This work continues to lead to the discovery of genes associated with specific diseases and inherited health risks, such as sickle cell anemia. Advances in biotechnology have created research opportunities in almost all areas of biology, with commercial applications in areas such as medicine, agriculture, and [[environmental remediation]].

==Specialists==
Most biological scientists specialize in the study of a certain type of organism or in a specific activity, although recent advances have blurred some traditional classifications.{{why|provide explanation of this and sources|date=October 2013}}
* [[Geneticist]]s study [[genetics]], the science of [[genes]], [[heredity]], and [[Genetic variation|variation]] of [[organism]]s.
* [[Neuroscientist]]s study the [[nervous system]].
* [[Developmental biology|Developmental biologists]] study the process of development and growth of [[organism]]s
* [[Biochemistry|Biochemists]] study the chemical composition of living things. They analyze the complex chemical combinations and reactions involved in [[metabolism]], [[reproduction]], and growth.
* [[Molecular biology|Molecular biologists]] study the [[biological activity]] between [[biomolecule]]s.
* [[Microbiology|Microbiologists]] investigate the growth and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as [[bacteria]], [[algae]], or [[Fungus|fungi]].
* [[Physiology|Physiologists]] study life functions of plants and animals,  in the whole organism and at the cellular or molecular level, under normal and abnormal conditions. Physiologists often specialize in functions such as growth, reproduction, [[photosynthesis]], respiration, or movement, or in the physiology of a certain area or system of the organism.
* [[Biophysics|Biophysicists]] use experimental methods traditionally employed in [[physics]] to answer biological questions .
* [[Computational Biology|Computational Biologists]] apply the techniques of [[computer science]], [[applied mathematics]] and [[statistics]] to address biological problems. The main focus lies on developing [[mathematical modeling]] and computational simulation techniques. By these means it addresses scientific research topics with their theoretical and experimental questions without a laboratory.
* [[Zoology|Zoologists]] and wildlife biologists study animals and wildlife—their origin, behavior, diseases, and life processes. Some experiment with live animals in controlled or natural surroundings, while others dissect dead animals to study their structure. Zoologists and wildlife biologists also may collect and analyze biological data to determine the environmental effects of current and potential uses of land and water areas. Zoologists usually are identified by the animal group they study. For example, [[ornithology|ornithologists]] study [[bird]]s, [[mammalogy|mammalogists]] study [[mammal]]s, [[herpetology|herpetologists]] study [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s, [[ichthyology|ichthyologists]] study [[fish]], [[cnidariologist]]s study [[jellyfish]]es and [[entomologist]]s study insects.
* [[Botany|Botanists]] study plants and their environments. Some study all aspects of plant life, including [[algae]], [[lichen]]s, [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s, [[Pinophyta|conifers]], and [[flowering plant]]s; others specialize in areas such as identification and classification of plants, the structure and function of plant parts, the biochemistry of plant processes, the causes and cures of plant diseases, the interaction of plants with other organisms and the environment, the geological record of plants and their evolution.  [[Mycology|Mycologists]] study [[fungi]], such as [[yeasts]], [[mold]] and [[mushrooms]], which are a separate kingdom from plants.
* Aquatic biologists study micro-organisms, plants, and animals living in water. [[Marine Biology|Marine biologists]] study salt water organisms, and limnologists study [[Limnology|fresh water organisms]]. Much of the work of marine biology centers on [[molecular biology]], the study of the biochemical processes that take place inside living cells. Marine biology is a branch of [[oceanography]], which is the study of the biological, chemical, geological, and physical characteristics of oceans and the ocean floor. (See the Handbook statements on environmental scientists and hydrologists and on geoscientists.)
* [[Ecology|Ecologists]] investigate the relationships among organisms and between organisms and their environments, examining the effects of population size, pollutants, rainfall, temperature, and altitude. Using knowledge of various scientific disciplines, ecologists may collect, study, and report data on the quality of air, food, soil, and water.
* [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologists]] investigate the [[evolution|evolutionary processes]] that produced the [[Biodiversity|diversity of life]] on [[Earth]], starting from [[Last universal common ancestor|a single common ancestor]]. These processes include [[natural selection]], [[common descent]], and [[speciation]].

==Working conditions==
Biological scientists are not usually exposed to unsafe or unhealthy conditions. Those who work with dangerous organisms or [[Toxicity|toxic]] substances in the laboratory must follow strict [[safety]] procedures to avoid [[contamination]]. Many biological scientists, such as botanists, ecologists, and zoologists, conduct field studies that involve strenuous physical activity and primitive living conditions. Biological scientists in the field may work in warm or cold climates, in all kinds of [[weather]].

Marine biologists encounter a variety of working conditions. Some work in laboratories; others work on research ships, and those who work underwater must practice safe diving while working around sharp [[coral reef]]s and hazardous marine life. Although some marine biologists obtain their specimens from the sea, many still spend a good deal of their time in laboratories and offices, conducting tests, running experiments, recording results, and compiling data.

Many biological scientists depend on [[Grant (money)|grant money]] to fund their research. They may be under pressure to meet deadlines and to conform to rigid grant-writing specifications when preparing proposals to seek new or extended funding.

Biological scientists typically work regular hours. While the 40-hour workweek is common, longer hours are not uncommon. Researchers may be required to work odd hours in laboratories or other locations (especially while in the field), depending on the nature of their research.

==Honors and awards==
The highest honor awarded to biologists is the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], awarded since 1901, by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Another significant award is the [[Crafoord Prize]] in Biosciences; established in 1980.

== Families ==
As of early 2016, there are three families belonging to the MACPF superfamily:
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.12 1.C.12] - [[Cholesterol-dependent cytolysin|The Thiol-activated Cholesterol-dependent Cytolysin (CDC) Family]]
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39 1.C.39] - The Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) Family
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.97 1.C.97] - [[Pleurotolysin|The Pleurotolysin Pore-forming (Pleurotolysin) Family]]

=== Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) Family  ===
Proteins containing MACPF domains play key roles in vertebrate immunity, embryonic development, and neural-cell migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Disparate proteins use similar architectures to damage membranes|journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date = 2008-10-01|issn = 0968-0004|pmid = 18778941|pages = 482–490|volume = 33|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2008.07.004|first = Gregor|last = Anderluh|first2 = Jeremy H.|last2 = Lakey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ninth component of complement and perforin form oligomeric pores that lyse bacteria and kill virus-infected cells, respectively. The crystal structure of a bacterial MACPF protein, Plu-MACPF from ''Photorhabdus luminescens'' was determined ({{PDB|2QP2}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A common fold mediates vertebrate defense and bacterial attack|journal = Science |date = 2007-09-14|issn = 1095-9203|pmid = 17717151|pages = 1548–1551|volume = 317|issue = 5844|doi = 10.1126/science.1144706|first = Carlos J.|last = Rosado|first2 = Ashley M.|last2 = Buckle|first3 = Ruby H.

A representative list of proteins belonging to the MACPF family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39.9 Transporter Classification Database].

== Biological roles of MACPF domain containing proteins ==
Many proteins belonging to the MACPF superfamily play key roles in plant and animal immunity.

[[Complement system|Complement proteins]] C6-C9 all contain a MACPF domain and assemble into the membrane attack complex.  C6, C7 and C8β appear to be non-lytic and function as scaffold proteins within the MAC. In contrast both C8α and C9 are capable of lysing cells. The final stage of MAC formation involves polymerisation of C9 into a large pore that punches a hole in the outer membrane of [[gram-negative bacteria]].

[[Perforin]] is stored in granules within cytotoxic T-cells and is responsible for killing virally infected and transformed cells. Perforin functions via two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, like C9, high concentrations of perforin can form pores that lyse cells. Secondly, perforin permits delivery of the cytotoxic granzymes A and B into target cells. Once delivered, granzymes are able to induce apoptosis and cause target cell death.&lt;ref name="Voskoboinik I, Smyth MJ, Trapani JA 2006 940–52"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kaiserman D, Bird CH, Sun J, etal |title=The major human and mouse granzymes are structurally and functionally divergent |journal=J. Cell Biol. |volume=175 |issue=4 |pages=619–30 |year=2006 |pmid=17116752 |doi=10.1083/jcb.200606073 |pmc=2064598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant protein CAD1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39.11.3 TC# 1.C.39.11.3]) functions in the plant immune response to bacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Morita-Yamamuro C, Tsutsui T, Sato M, etal |title=The Arabidopsis gene CAD1 controls programmed cell death in the plant immune system and encodes a protein containing a MACPF domain |journal=Plant Cell Physiol. |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=902–12 |year=2005 |pmid=15799997 |doi=10.1093/pcp/pci095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Salicylic acid and a chitin elicitor both control expression of the CAD1 gene involved in the plant immunity of Arabidopsis|journal = Bioscience, Biotechnology, and Biochemistry|date = 2006-09-01|issn = 0916-8451|pmid = 16960394|pages = 2042–2048|volume = 70|issue = 9|doi = 10.1271/bbb.50700|first = Tomokazu|last = Tsutsui|first2 = Chizuko|last2 = Morita-Yamamuro|first3 = Yutaka|last3 = Asada|first4 = Eiichi|last4 = Minami|first5 = Naoto|last5 = Shibuya|first6 = Akira|last6 = Ikeda|first7 = Junji|last7 = Yamaguchi|hdl = 2115/14840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sea anemone]] ''Actineria villosa'' uses a MACPF (AvTX-60A; [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39.10.1 TC# 1.C.39.10.1])protein as a lethal toxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Oshiro N, Kobayashi C, Iwanaga S, etal |title=A new membrane-attack complex/perforin (MACPF) domain lethal toxin from the nematocyst venom of the Okinawan sea anemone Actineria villosa |journal=Toxicon |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=225–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15019483 |doi=10.1016/j.toxicon.2003.11.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MACPF proteins are also important for the invasion of the [[Malarial]] parasite into the mosquito host and the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kadota K, Ishino T, Matsuyama T, Chinzei Y, Yuda M |title=Essential role of membrane-attack protein in malarial transmission to mosquito host |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=101 |issue=46 |pages=16310–5 |year=2004 |pmid=15520375 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0406187101 |pmc=524694}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ishino T, Chinzei Y, Yuda M |title=A Plasmodium sporozoite protein with a membrane attack complex domain is required for breaching the liver sinusoidal cell layer prior to hepatocyte infection |journal=Cell.

Not all MACPF proteins function in defence or attack.  For example, [[astrotactin|astrotactin-1]] ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.87.3.1 TC# 9.B.87.3.1]) is involved in neural cell migration in mammals and apextrin ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.C.39.7.4 TC# 1.C.39.7.4]) is involved in sea urchin (''[[Heliocidaris erythrogramma]]'') development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zheng C, Heintz N, Hatten ME |title=CNS gene encoding astrotactin, which supports neuronal migration along glial fibers |journal=Science |volume=272 |issue=5260 |pages=417–9 |year=1996 |pmid=8602532 |doi=10.1126/science.272.5260.417}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haag ES, Sly BJ, Andrews ME, Raff RA |title=Apextrin, a novel extracellular protein associated with larval ectoderm evolution in Heliocidaris erythrogramma |journal=Dev.

Functionally uncharacterised MACPF proteins are sporadically distributed in bacteria. Several species of ''Chlamydia'' contain MACPF proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ponting CP |title=Chlamydial homologues of the MACPF (MAC/perforin) domain |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=9 |issue=24 |pages=R911–3 |year=1999 |pmid=10608922 |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(00)80102-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The insect pathogenic bacteria ''[[Photorhabdus luminescens]]'' also contains a MACPF protein, however, this molecule appears non-lytic.&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt;

==Structure and mechanism==
The X-ray crystal structure of Plu-MACPF, a protein from the [[insect]] pathogenic [[enterobacteria]] ''[[Photorhabdus luminescens]]'' has been determined (figure 1).[http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2QP2]  These data reveal that the MACPF domain is homologous to [[pore forming toxins|pore forming]] cholesterol dependent cytolysins (CDC's) from [[Gram positive|gram-positive]] pathogenic bacteria such as ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' (which causes [[gas gangrene]]).  The [[amino acid]] sequence identity between the two families is extremely low, and the relationship is not detectable using conventional sequence based data mining techniques.&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt;

It is suggested that MACPF proteins and CDCs form pores in the same way (figure 1).&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt; Specifically it is hypothesised that MACPF proteins oligomerise to form a large circular pore (figure 2).   A concerted conformational change within each monomer then results in two [[Alpha helix|α-helical]] regions unwinding to form four [[amphipathic]] [[Beta sheet|β-strands]] that span the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] of the target cell.&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt;  Like CDC's MACPF proteins are thus β-pore forming toxins that act like a molecular hole punch.

Other crystal structures for members of the MACPF superfamily can be found in RCSB: i.e., {{PDB2|3KK7}}, {{PDB2|3QOS}}, {{PDB2|3QQH}}, {{PDB2|3RD7}}, {{PDB2|3OJY}}

==Control of MACPF proteins==
Complement regulatory proteins such as [[CD59]] function as [[membrane attack complex|MAC]] inhibitors and prevent inappropriate activity of complement against self cells (Figure 3).  Biochemical studies have revealed the peptide sequences in C8α and C9 that bind to CD59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Huang Y, Qiao F, Abagyan R, Hazard S, Tomlinson S |title=Defining the CD59-C9 binding interaction |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=281 |issue=37 |pages=27398–404 |year=2006 |pmid=16844690 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M603690200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lockert DH, Kaufman KM, Chang CP, Hüsler T, Sodetz JM, Sims PJ |title=Identity of the segment of human complement C8 recognized by complement regulatory protein CD59 |journal=J.

It is therefore suggested that CD59 directly inhibits the MAC by interfering with conformational change in one of the membrane spanning regions.&lt;ref name="plumacpf"/&gt;

Other proteins that bind to the MAC include C8γ. This protein belongs to the [[lipocalin]] family and interacts with C8α. The binding site on C8α is known, however, the precise role of C8γ in the MAC remains to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Schreck SF, Plumb ME, Platteborze PL, etal |title=Expression and characterization of recombinant subunits of human complement component C8: further analysis of the function of C8 alpha and C8 gamma |journal=J.

==Process overview==
When cells experience metabolic or environmental [[Stress (biology)|stresses]], mitochondrial fusion and [[mitochondrial fission|fission]] work to maintain functional mitochondria. An increase in fusion activity leads to mitochondrial elongation, whereas an increase in fission activity results in mitochondrial fragmentation.&lt;ref name=Chan2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chan | first1 = DC | year = 2006 | title = Mitochondrial fusion and fission in mammals | url =https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7638/1/CHAarcdb06.pdf | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 22| pages = 79–99 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.22.010305.104638 | pmid = 16704336 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The components of this process can influence [[programmed cell death]] and lead to [[neurodegenerative disorder]]s such as [[Parkinson's disease]]. Such cell death can be caused by disruptions in the process of either fusion or fission.&lt;ref name=Youle2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Youle|first1=Richard J.|title=Mitochondrial Fission, Fusion, and Stress|journal=Science Magazine|date=31 August 2012|volume=337| issue =  6098|pages=1062–1065|doi=10.1126/science.1219855|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/337/6098/1062.full#ref-1|accessdate=23 November 2014|pmid=22936770|pmc=4762028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shapes of mitochondria in cells are continually changing via a combination of fission, fusion, and motility. Specifically, fusion assists in modifying stress by integrating the contents of slightly damaged mitochondria as a form of complementation. By enabling [[genetic complementation]], fusion of the mitochondria allows for two mitochondrial [[genome]]s with different defects within the same organelle to individually encode what the other lacks. In doing so, these mitochondrial genomes generate all of the necessary components for a functional mitochondrion.&lt;ref name="Hales2010" /&gt;

==With mitochondrial fission==

The combined effects of continuous fusion and fission give rise to mitochondrial networks. The mechanisms of mitochondrial fusion and fission are regulated by [[proteolysis]] and posttranslational modifications. The actions of fission, fusion and motility cause the shapes of these double membrane bound subcellular organelles we know as mitochondria to continually alter their shapes.

The changes in balance between the rates of mitochondrial fission and fusion directly affect the wide range of mitochondrial lengths that can be observed in different cell types. Rapid fission and fusion of the mitochondria in cultured fibroblasts has been shown to promote the redistribution of mitochondrial [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) from one mitochondrion to all of the other mitochondria. This process can occur in a cell within a time period as short as an hour.&lt;ref name="Youle2012" /&gt;

The significance of mitochondrial fission and fusion is distinct for nonproliferating neurons, which are unable to survive without mitochondrial fission. Such nonproliferating neurons cause two human diseases known as [[Kjer's optic neuropathy|dominant optic atrophy]] and [[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease|Charcot Marie Tooth disease]] type 2A, which are both caused by fusion defects. Though the importance of these processes is evident, it is still unclear why mitochondrial fission and fusion are necessary for nonproliferating cells.

==Regulation==

Many gene products that control mitochondrial fusion have been identified, and can be reduced to three core groups which also control mitochondrial fission. These groups of proteins include mitofusins, [[OPA1]]/Mgm1, and Drp1/[[DNM1|Dnm1]]. All of these molecules are GTP hydrolyzing proteins ([[GTPases]]) that belong to the [[dynamin]] family. Mitochondrial dynamics in different cells are understood by the way in which these proteins regulate and bind to each other.&lt;ref name=Hales2010/&gt; These GTPases in control of mitochondrial fusion are well conserved between mammals, flies, and yeast. Mitochondrial fusion mediators differ between the outer and inner membranes of the mitochondria. Specific membrane-anchored dynamin family members mediate fusion between mitochondrial outer membranes known as [[MFN1|Mfn1]] and [[MFN2|Mfn2]]. These two proteins are mitofusin contained within humans that can alter the morphology of affected mitochondria in over-expressed conditions. However, a single dynamin family member known as OPA1 in mammals mediates fusion between mitochondrial inner membranes. These regulating proteins of mitochondrial fusion are organism-dependent; therefore, in ''Drosophila'' (fruit flies) and yeasts, the process is controlled by the mitochondrial transmembrane GTPase, Fzo.  In ''Drosophila'', Fzo is found in postmeiotic spermatids and the dysfunction of this protein results in male sterility.  However, a deletion of Fzo1 in budding yeast results in smaller, spherical mitochondria due to the lack of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).

==Apoptosis==

The balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission in cells is dictated by the up-and-down regulation of mitofusins, OPA1/Mgm1, and Drp1/Dnm1. [[Apoptosis]], or [[programmed cell death]], begins with the breakdown of mitochondria into smaller pieces. This process results from up-regulation of Drp1/Dnm1 and down-regulation of mitofusins. Later in the apoptosis cycle, an alteration of OPA1/Mgm1 activity within the inner mitochondrial membrane occurs. The role of the OPA1 protein is to protect cells against apoptosis by inhibiting the release of [[cytochrome c]]. Once this protein is altered, there is a change in the cristae structure, release of cytochrome c, and the activation of the destructive caspase enzymes. These resulting changes indicate that inner mitochondrial membrane structure is linked with regulatory pathways in influencing cell life and death. OPA1 plays both a genetic and molecular role in mitochondrial fusion and in cristae remodeling during apoptosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frezza | first1 = C | last2 = Cipolat | first2 = S | last3 = Martins | last4 = de Brito | first4 = O | last5 = Micaroni | first5 = M | last6 = Benznoussenko | first6 = GV | last7 = Rudka | first7 = T | last8 = Bartoli | first8 = D | last9 = Polishuck | first9 = RS | last10 = Danial | first10 = NN | last11 = De Strooper | first11 = B | last12 = Scorrano | first12 = L | year = 2006 | title = OPA1 controls apoptotic cristae remodeling independently from mitochondrial fusion | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 1| pages = 177–189 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.06.025 | pmid = 16839885 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OPA1 exists in two forms; the first being soluble and found in the intermembrane space, and the second as an integral inner membrane form, work together to restructure and shape the cristae during and after apoptosis. OPA1 blocks intramitochondrial cytochrome c redistribution which proceeds remodeling of the cristae.  OPA1 functions to protect cells with mitochondrial dysfunction due to Mfn deficiencies, doubly for those lacking Mfn1 and Mfn2, but it plays a greater role in cells with only Mfn1 deficiencies as opposed to Mfn2 deficiencies.  Therefore, it is supported that OPA1 function is dependent on the amount of Mfn1 present in the cell to promote mitochondrial elongation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cipolat | first1 = S | last2 = Martins | last3 = de Brito | first3 = O | last4 = Dal Zilio | first4 = B | last5 = Scorrano | first5 = L | year = 2004 | title = OPA1 requires mitofusin 1 to promote mitochondrial fusion | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 101 | issue = 45| pages = 15927–15932 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0407043101 | pmid = 15509649 | pmc=528769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mammals==

Both proteins, Mfn1 and Mfn2, can act either together or separately during mitochondrial fusion.  Mfn1 and Mfn2 are 81% similar to each other and about 51% similar to the ''Drosophila'' protein Fzo.  Results published for a study to determine the impact of fusion on mitochondrial structure revealed that Mfn-deficient cells demonstrated either elongated cells (majority) or small, spherical cells upon observation.

The Mfn protein has three different methods of action:  Mfn1 homotypic [[oligomer]]s, Mfn2 homotypic oligomers and Mfn1-Mfn2 heterotypic oligomers.  It has been suggested that the type of cell determines the method of action but it has yet to be concluded whether or not Mfn1 and Mfn2 perform the same function in the process or if they are separate.  Cells lacking this protein are subject to severe cellular defects such as poor cell growth, heterogeneity of mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased [[cellular respiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = H | last2 = Chomyn | first2 = A | last3 = Chan | first3 = DC | year = 2005 | title = Disruption of fusion results in mitochondrial heterogeneity and dysfunction | url = | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 280 | issue = 28| pages = 26185–26192 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M503062200 | pmid = 15899901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitochondrial fusion plays an important role in the process of [[Embryogenesis|embroygenesis]], as shown through the Mfn1 and Mfn2 proteins. Using Mfn1 and Mfn2 [[gene knockout|knock-out]] mice, which die in utero at midgestation due to a placental deficiency, mitochondrial fusion was shown not to be essential for cell survival in vitro, but necessary for embryonic development and cell survival throughout later stages of development. Mfn1 Mfn2 double knock-out mice, which die even earlier in development, were distinguished from the "single" knock-out mice. Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) originated from the double knock-out mice, which do survive in culture even though there is a complete absence of fusion, but parts of their mitochondria show a reduced mitochondrial DNA ([[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]]) copy number and lose membrane potential. This series of events causes problems with [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) synthesis.

== The Mitochondrial Inner/Outer Membrane Fusion (MMF) Family ==
The Mitochondrial Inner/Outer Membrane Fusion (MMF) Family ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.25 TC# 9.B.25]) is a family of proteins that play a role in mitochondrial fusion events. This family belongs to the larger [[Mitochondrial carrier|Mitochondrial Carrier (MC) Superfamily]]. The dynamic nature of mitochondria is critical for function. Chen and Chan (2010) have discussed the molecular basis of mitochondrial fusion, its protective role in neurodegeneration, and its importance in cellular function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Physiological functions of mitochondrial fusion|journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date = 2010-07-01|issn = 1749-6632|pmid = 20649534|pages = 21–25|volume = 1201|doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05615.x|first = Hsiuchen|last = Chen|first2 = David C.|last2 = Chan|url = https://zenodo.org/record/896791}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mammalian mitofusins Mfn1 and Mfn2, GTPases localized to the outer membrane, mediate outer-membrane fusion. OPA1, a GTPase associated with the inner membrane, mediates subsequent inner-membrane fusion. Mutations in Mfn2 or OPA1 cause [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] diseases. Mitochondrial fusion enables content mixing within a mitochondrial population, thereby preventing permanent loss of essential components. Cells with reduced mitochondrial fusion show a subpopulation of mitochondria that lack mtDNA nucleoids. Such mtDNA defects lead to respiration-deficient mitochondria, and their accumulation in neurons leads to impaired outgrowth of cellular processes and consequent neurodegeneration.

=== Family members ===
A representative list of the proteins belonging to the MMF family is available in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.25.2 Transporter Classification Database].
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.25.1.1 9.B.25.1.1] - The mitochondrial inner/outer membrane fusion complex, Fzo/Mgm1/Ugo1. Only the Ugo1 protein is a member of the MC superfamily.
* [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.25.2.1 9.B.25.2.1] - The mammalian mitochondrial membrane fusion complex, Mitofusin 1 (Mfn1)/Mfn2/Optical Atrophy Protein 1 (OPA1) complex. This subfamily includes mitofusins 1 and 2.

=== Mitofusins: Mfn1 and Mfn2 ===
[[MFN1|Mfn1]] and [[MFN2|Mfn2]] ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=9.B.25.2.1 TC# 9.B.25.2.1]; [https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q8IWA4 Q8IWA4] and [https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O95140 O95140], respectively), in mammalian cells are required for mitochondrial fusion, Mfn1 and Mfn2 possess functional distinctions. For instance, the formation of tethered structures ''in vitro'' occurs more readily when mitochondria are isolated from cells overexpressing Mfn1 than Mfn2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mitofusin 1 and 2 play distinct roles in mitochondrial fusion reactions via GTPase activity|journal = Journal of Cell Science|date = 2004-12-15|issn = 0021-9533|pmid = 15572413|pages = 6535–6546|volume = 117|issue = Pt 26|doi = 10.1242/jcs.01565|first = Naotada|last = Ishihara|first2 = Yuka|last2 = Eura|first3 = Katsuyoshi|last3 = Mihara}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Mfn2 specifically has been shown to associate with Bax and Bak (Bcl-2 family, [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=1.a.21 TC#1.A.21]), resulting in altered Mfn2 activity, indicating that the mitofusins possess unique functional characteristics. Lipidic holes may open on opposing bilayers as intermediates, and fusion in cardiac [[myocyte]]s is coupled with outer mitochondrial membrane destabilization that is opportunistically employed during the  mitochondrial permeability transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mitofusins and the mitochondrial permeability transition: the potential downside of mitochondrial fusion|journal = American Journal of Physiology. Heart and Circulatory Physiology|date = 2012-08-01|issn = 1522-1539|pmc = 3423162|pmid = 22636681|pages = H243–255|volume = 303|issue = 3|doi = 10.1152/ajpheart.00185.2012|first = Kyriakos N.|last = Papanicolaou|first2 = Matthew M.|last2 = Phillippo|first3 = Kenneth|last3 = Walsh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutations in Mfn2 (but not Mfn1) result in the neurological disorder [[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease|Charcot-Marie-Tooth]] syndrome. These mutations can be complemented by the formation of Mfn1–Mfn2&lt;sup&gt;CMT2A&lt;/sup&gt; hetero-oligomers but not homo-oligomers of Mfn2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;–Mfn2&lt;sup&gt;CMT2A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Complementation between mouse Mfn1 and Mfn2 protects mitochondrial fusion defects caused by CMT2A disease mutations|journal = The Journal of Cell Biology|date = 2007-02-12|issn = 0021-9525|pmc = 2063976|pmid = 17296794|pages = 405–414|volume = 176|issue = 4|doi = 10.1083/jcb.200611080|first = Scott A.|last = Detmer|first2 = David C.|last2 = Chan}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that within the Mfn1–Mfn2 hetero-oligomeric complex, each molecule is functionally distinct.  This suggests that control of the expression levels of each protein likely represents the most basic form of regulation to alter mitochondrial dynamics in mammalian tissues. Indeed, the expression levels of Mfn1 and Mfn2 vary according to cell or tissue type as does the mitochondrial morphology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Two mitofusin proteins, mammalian homologues of FZO, with distinct functions are both required for mitochondrial fusion|journal = Journal of Biochemistry|date = 2003-09-01|issn = 0021-924X|pmid = 14561718|pages = 333–344|volume = 134|issue = 3|first = Yuka|last = Eura|first2 = Naotada|last2 = Ishihara|first3 = Sadaki|last3 = Yokota|first4 = Katsuyoshi|last4 = Mihara|doi=10.1093/jb/mvg150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yeast mitochondrial fusion proteins ===
In yeast, three proteins are essential for mitochondrial fusion. Fzo1 ([https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P38297 P38297]) and Mgm1 ([https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P32266 P32266]) are conserved guanosine triphosphatases that reside in the outer and inner membranes, respectively. At each membrane, these conserved proteins are required for the distinct steps of membrane tethering and lipid mixing. The third essential component is Ugo1, an outer membrane protein with a region homologous to but distantly related to a region in the Mitochondrial Carrier (MC) family. Hoppins ''et al.'', 2009 showed that Ugo1 is a modified member of this family, containing three transmembrane domains and existing as a dimer, a structure that is critical for the fusion function of Ugo1.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The molecular mechanism of mitochondrial fusion|journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date = 2009-01-01|issn = 0006-3002|pmid = 18691613|pages = 20–26|volume = 1793|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.07.005|first = Suzanne|last = Hoppins|first2 = Jodi|last2 = Nunnari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their analyses of Ugo1 indicate that it is required for both outer and inner membrane fusion after membrane tethering, indicating that it operates at the lipid-mixing step of fusion. This role is distinct from the fusion dynamin-related proteins and thus demonstrates that at each membrane, a single fusion protein is not sufficient to drive the lipid-mixing step. Instead, this step requires a more complex assembly of proteins. The formation of a fusion pore has not yet been demonstrated.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mitochondrial outer and inner membrane fusion requires a modified carrier protein|journal = The Journal of Cell Biology|date = 2009-02-23|issn = 1540-8140|pmc = 2654124|pmid = 19237599|pages = 569–581|volume = 184|issue = 4|doi = 10.1083/jcb.200809099|first = Suzanne|last = Hoppins|first2 = Jennifer|last2 = Horner|first3 = Cheng|last3 = Song|first4 = J.

AbgT is 510 amino acyl residues long and has 12-13 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). MtrF is 522 aas long and has 11 or 12 putative TMSs. The 3-d structures of MtrF and a YdaH homologue have been solved, and functional studies show that it is a drug exporter.  The 3-d structure shows that it has 9 TMSs with hairpin entry loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Su CC, Bolla JR, Kumar N, Radhakrishnan A, Long F, Delmar JA, Chou TH, Rajashankar KR, Shafer WM, Yu EW | title = Structure and function of Neisseria gonorrhoeae MtrF illuminates a class of antimetabolite efflux pumps | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–70 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25818299 | pmc = 4410016 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.03.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal Structures:

== Genetics ==
The ''abgT'' gene is preceded by two genes, ''abgA'' and ''abgB,'' which code for homologous amino acyl amino hydrolases and hydrolyze ''p''-aminobenzoyl glutamate to ''p''-aminobenzoate and glutamate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of the structural similarity of ''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutatmate to peptides, and the enzymatic activities of the ''abgA'' and ''abgB'' gene products, it has been suggested that AbgT is also a peptide transporter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Demonstration of an energy requirement suggested an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent mechanism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Expression of these genes is regulated by AbgR and an unknown effector.

== Function ==
As noted above, the AbgT family of transporters has been thought to contribute to bacterial [[Folic acid|folate biosynthesis]] by importing the catabolite ''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate for producing folate. Approximately 13,000 putative family members were identified in 2015.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Delmar JA, Yu EW | title = The AbgT family: A novel class of antimetabolite transporters | journal = Protein Science | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 322–37 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26443496 | pmc = 4815354 | doi = 10.1002/pro.2820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The X-ray structures of the full-length ''[[Alcanivorax borkumensis]]'' YdaH (AbgT) and ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' MtrF proteins. The structures revealed that these two transporters assemble as dimers with architectures distinct from all other families of transporters for which 3-d structures were available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolla JR, Su CC, Delmar JA, Radhakrishnan A, Kumar N, Chou TH, Long F, Rajashankar KR, Yu EW | title = Crystal structure of the Alcanivorax borkumensis YdaH transporter reveals an unusual topology | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 6 | pages = 6874 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25892120 | pmc = 4410182 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms7874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both YdaH and MtrF are bowl-shaped dimers with a solvent-filled basin extending from the cytoplasm halfway across the [[Lipid bilayer|membrane bilayer]]. The protomers of YdaH and MtrF contain nine transmembrane helices and two hairpins which suggested a plausible pathway for substrate transport.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A combination of the crystal structure, genetic analyses and substrate accumulation assays indicated that both YdaH and MtrF behave as exporters, capable of removing the folate metabolite ''p''-aminobenzoic acid from bacterial cells. In fact, it was shown that both YdaH and MtrF participate as [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] efflux pumps, mediating bacterial resistance to [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide antimetabolite drugs]]. Possibly, many AbgT-family transporters act as exporters, conferring resistance to [[Sulfadiazine|sulfonamides]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Transport reaction ===
The generalized transport reaction initially proposed for AbgT is:&lt;blockquote&gt;''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate (out) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → ''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate (in) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)&lt;/blockquote&gt;but the more recently proposed transport reaction is:&lt;blockquote&gt;Sulfonamide drugs (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Sulfonamide drugs (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== CitM and CitH ==
Two of the characterized members of the CitMHS family, both [[Citric acid|citrate]] uptake permeases from ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', are CitM ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.11.1.1 TC# 2.A.11.1.1]) and CitH ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.11.1.2 TC# 2.A.11.1.2])''.''

A CitM homologue in ''[[Streptococcus mutans|S. mutans]]'' transports citrate conjugated to [[Ferrous|Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]] or Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; but not Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Korithoski|first=Bryan|last2=Krastel|first2=Kirsten|last3=Cvitkovitch|first3=Dennis G.|date=2005-07-01|title=Transport and metabolism of citrate by Streptococcus mutans|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=187|issue=13|pages=4451–4456|doi=10.1128/JB.187.13.4451-4456.2005|issn=0021-9193|pmc=1151779|pmid=15968054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transport reactions catalyzed by (1) CitM and (2) CitH, respectively, are:

'''Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporter A (NhaA) family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.33 TC# 2.A.33]) contains a number of bacterial sodium-proton [[antiporter]] (SPAP) proteins. These are integral [[membrane protein]]s that catalyse the exchange of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in a manner that is highly pH dependent. Homologues have been sequenced from a number of bacteria and archaea. Prokaryotes possess multiple paralogues. A representative list of the proteins that belong to the NhaA family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.33.1 Transporter Classification Database].

== Structure ==

Proteins of the NhaA family are of 300-700 amino acyl residues in length. NhaA of ''E. coli'' is a homeodimer, each subunit consisting of a bundle of 12 tilted transmembrane α-helices (TMSs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams KA, Geldmacher-Kaufer U, Padan E, Schuldiner S, Kühlbrandt W | title = Projection structure of NhaA, a secondary transporter from Escherichia coli, at 4.0 A resolution | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 13 | pages = 3558–63 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10393172 | pmc = 1171434 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/18.13.3558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams KA | title = Three-dimensional structure of the ion-coupled transport protein NhaA | journal = Nature | volume = 403 | issue = 6765 | pages = 112–5 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10638764 | doi = 10.1038/47534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunte C, Screpanti E, Venturi M, Rimon A, Padan E, Michel H | title = Structure of a Na+/H+ antiporter and insights into mechanism of action and regulation by pH | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7046 | pages = 1197–202 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15988517 | doi = 10.1038/nature03692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olkhova E, Hunte C, Screpanti E, Padan E, Michel H | title = Multiconformation continuum electrostatics analysis of the NhaA Na+/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli with functional implications | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 8 | pages = 2629–34 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16477015 | pmc = 1413810 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0510914103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Screpanti E, Padan E, Rimon A, Michel H, Hunte C | title = Crucial steps in the structure determination of the Na+/H+ antiporter NhaA in its native conformation | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 362 | issue = 2 | pages = 192–202 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16919297 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2006.07.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporters are integral membrane proteins that exchange Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; for H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; across the cytoplasmic membrane and many intracellular membranes.

NhaB homologues are usually about 500 amino acyl residues (aas) in length and possess about 12 transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs), although some members differ in their number of TMSs. NhaB homologues also exhibit a region with limited sequence similarity to a 46 kDa membrane protein of unknown function from ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]'' (spP46838) which is also homologous to a member of arsenate resistance pumps of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.a.4 TC# 3.A.4]). Only [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] bacterial proteins have been functionally characterized.

The '''Monovalent Cation:Proton Antiporter-1 (CPA1) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36 TC# 2.A.36]) is a large family of proteins derived from [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] bacteria, [[Cyanobacteria|blue-green bacteria]], [[archaea]], [[yeast]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. The CPA1 family belongs to the VIC superfamily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang AB, Lin R, Keith Studley W, Tran CV, Saier MH | title = Phylogeny as a guide to structure and function of membrane transport proteins | journal = Molecular Membrane Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 171–81 | date = 2004-06-01 | pmid = 15204625 | doi = 10.1080/09687680410001720830 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saier MH, Eng BH, Fard S, Garg J, Haggerty DA, Hutchinson WJ, Jack DL, Lai EC, Liu HJ, Nusinew DP, Omar AM, Pao SS, Paulsen IT, Quan JA, Sliwinski M, Tseng TT, Wachi S, Young GB | title = Phylogenetic characterization of novel transport protein families revealed by genome analyses | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1422 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–56 | date = February 1999 | pmid = 10082980 | doi = 10.1016/s0304-4157(98)00023-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transporters from eukaryotes have been functionally characterized to catalyze Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exchange. Their primary physiological functions are thought to be in (1) cytoplasmic pH regulation, extruding the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; generated during metabolism, and (2) salt tolerance (in plants), due to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake into vacuoles. Bacterial homologues have also been found to facilitate Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[Antiporter|antiport]], but some also catalyze Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport or Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waditee R, Hibino T, Tanaka Y, Nakamura T, Incharoensakdi A, Takabe T | title = Halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica contains an Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, homologous to eukaryotic ones, with novel ion specificity affected by C-terminal tail | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 276 | issue = 40 | pages = 36931–8 | date = October 2001 | pmid = 11479290 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M103650200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phylogeny ==
The [[phylogenetic tree]] for the CPA1 family shows three principal clusters. The first cluster includes proteins derived exclusively from animals, and all of the functionally characterized members of the family belong to this cluster. Of the two remaining clusters, one includes all bacterial homologues while the other includes one from ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]],'' one from ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and two from yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe|S. pombe]]''). Several organisms possess multiple paralogues; for example, seven paralogues are found in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]],'' and five are known in humans. Most of these paralogues are very similar in sequence, and they belong to the animal specific cluster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A representative list of proteins belonging to the CPA1 family can be found in the [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36.8 Transporter Classification Database].

== Structure ==
Numerous members of the CPA1 family have been sequenced, and these proteins vary substantially in size. The bacterial proteins have 520-550 amino acyl residues (aas) while eukaryotic proteins are generally larger, varying in size from 540-900 residues. They exhibit 10-12 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). A proposed [[Topology|topological]] model suggests that in addition to 12 TMSs, a region between TMSs 9 and 10 dips into the membrane to line the pore. However, one homologue, Nhx1 of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]]'' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36.1.12 TC# 2.A.36.1.12])'','' has an extracellular glycosylated C-terminus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wakabayashi S, Pang T, Su X, Shigekawa M | title = A novel topology model of the human Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 275 | issue = 11 | pages = 7942–9 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10713111 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.275.11.7942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wells KM, Rao R | title = The yeast Na+/H+ exchanger Nhx1 is an N-linked glycoprotein.

== Function ==
Using the mammalian NHE1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36.1.1 TC# 2.A.36.1.1]), it has been found that TMSs 4 and 9 as well as the extracellular loop between TMSs 3 and 4 are important for drug ([[amiloride]]- and [[benzoyl]] [[Guanidine|guanidinium]]-based derivatives) sensitivities. Mutations in these regions also affect transport activities. M4 and M9 therefore contain critical sites for both drug and [[cation]] recognition.

=== Transport Reaction ===
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by functionally characterized members of the CPA1 family is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.36|title=2.A.36 The Monovalent Cation:Proton Antiporter-1 (CPA1) Family|website=Transporter Classification Database|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) ⇌ Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Homology ==
A homologous, but only partially sequenced, system was earlier reported to catalyze Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport in an alkalophilic ''[[Bacillus]]'' strain. PhaA and PhaD are respectively homologous to the ND5 and ND4 subunits of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-pumping [[NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase]] ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.d.1 TC #3.D.1]). Homologous protein subunits from ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' NADH:quinone oxidoreductase can functionally replace MrpA and MrpD in ''[[Bacillus subtilis]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moparthi VK, Kumar B, Mathiesen C, Hägerhäll C | title = Homologous protein subunits from Escherichia coli NADH:quinone oxidoreductase can functionally replace MrpA and MrpD in Bacillus subtilis | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1807 | issue = 4 | pages = 427–36 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21236240 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbabio.2011.01.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homologues of PhaA, B, C and D and Nha1, 2, 3 and 4 of an alkalophilic ''Bacillus'' strain are the Yuf(Mrp)T, U, V and D genes of ''Bacillus subtilis''. In this system, YufT is believed to be responsible for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporter activity, but it does not have activity in the absence of other constituents of the operon.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kosono S, Morotomi S, Kitada M, Kudo T | title = Analyses of a Bacillus subtilis homologue of the Na+/H+ antiporter gene which is important for pH homeostasis of alkaliphilic Bacillus sp.

== Structure ==
The seven Pha proteins are of the following sizes (in #aas) and exhibit the following putative numbers of transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs): 
* PhaA - 725 and 17
* PhaB - 257 and 5
* PhaC - 115 and 3 
* PhaD - 547 and 13 
* PhaE - 161 and 3 
* PhaF - 92 and 3 
* PhaG - 120 and 3 
All are predicted to be integral membrane proteins.

Corresponding values for the ''[[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]]'' Mnh system are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hiramatsu T, Kodama K, Kuroda T, Mizushima T, Tsuchiya T | title = A putative multisubunit Na+/H+ antiporter from Staphylococcus aureus | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 180 | issue = 24 | pages = 6642–8 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9852009 | pmc = 107768 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* MnhA - 801 and 18 
* MnhB - 142 and 4
* MnhC - 113 and 3 
* MnhD - 498 and 13
* MnhE - 159 and 4
* MnhF - 97 and 3 
* MnhG - 118 and 3 
In view of the complexity of the system, large variation in subunit structure, and the homology with NDH family protein constituents, a complicated energy coupling mechanism, possibly involving a redox reaction, cannot be ruled out.

      <text bytes="3579" xml:space="preserve">In [[comparative genomics]], a '''sequence graph''', also called an '''alignment graph''', '''breakpoint graph''', or '''adjacency graph''', is a [[bidirected graph]] in which the vertices represent segments of [[Deoxyribonucleic Acid|DNA]] and the edges represent [[Centimorgan|adjacency]] between segments in a [[genome]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Alekseyev | first=M. A. | last2=Pevzner | first2=P. A. | title=Breakpoint graphs and ancestral genome reconstructions | journal=Genome Research | publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | volume=19 | issue=5 | date=2009-02-13 | issn=1088-9051 | pmid=19218533 | pmc=2675983 | doi=10.1101/gr.082784.108 | pages=943–957 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The segments are labeled by the DNA string they represent, and each edge connects the tail end of one segment with the head end of another segment. Each adjacency edge is labelled by a (possibly empty) string of DNA. Traversing a connected component of segments and adjacency edges (called a ''thread'') yields a sequence, which typically represents a genome or a section of a genome. The segments can be thought of as [[synteny]] blocks, with the edges dictating how to arrange these blocks in a particular genome, and the labelling of the adjacency edges representing bases that are not contained in synteny blocks. 

==Applications==
===Multiple sequence alignment===
Sequence graphs can be used to represent [[multiple sequence alignment|multiple sequence alignments]] with the addition of a new kind of edge representing [[homology (biology)|homology]] between segments. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Paten | first=Benedict | last2=Zerbino | first2=Daniel R | last3=Hickey | first3=Glenn | last4=Haussler | first4=David | title=A unifying model of genome evolution under parsimony | journal=[[BMC Bioinformatics]] | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=15 | issue=1 | date=2014-06-19 | issn=1471-2105 | doi=10.1186/1471-2105-15-206 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a set of genomes, one can create an acyclic breakpoint graph with a thread for each genome. For two segments &lt;math&gt;(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(c,d)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; represent the endpoints of the two segments, homology edges can be created from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; or from &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; - representing the two possible orientations of the homology. The advantage of representing a multiple sequence alignment this way is that it is possible to include inversions and other structural rearrangements that wouldn't be allowable in a matrix representation.

===Representing variation===
If there are multiple possible paths when traversing a thread in a sequence graph, multiple sequences can be represented by the same thread. This means it is possible to create a sequence graph that represents a population of individuals with slightly different genomes - with each genome corresponding to one path through the graph. These graphs have been proposed as a replacement for the [[reference genome|reference]] [[human genome]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | last=Paten | first=Benedict | last2=Novak | first2=Adam | last3=Haussler | first3=David | title=Mapping to a Reference Genome Structure | website=[[arXiv.org]] | date=2014-04-20 | url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5010v1 | ref=harv | access-date=2019-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the '''H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-translocating Pyrophosphatase (M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''-PPase)'' Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.a.10 TC# 3.A.10]) are found in the vacuolar ([[Vacuole|tonoplast]]) membranes of higher plants, [[algae]], and [[protozoa]], and in both bacteria and [[archaea]]. They are therefore ancient enzymes.

Two types of [[inorganic diphosphatase]], very different in terms of both [[amino acid sequence]] and [[Protein structure, secondary|structure]], have been characterised to date: soluble and [[transmembrane]] '''proton-pumping pyrophosphatases''' (sPPases and H(&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-PPases, respectively). sPPases are ubiquitous [[protein]]s that hydrolyse [[pyrophosphate]] to release heat, whereas H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases, so far unidentified in [[animal]] and [[fungus|fungal]] cells, couple the energy of PPi [[hydrolysis]] to [[proton]] movement across [[biology|biological]] [[Cell membrane|membrane]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid12451180"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perez-Castineira JR, Lopez-Marques RL, Villalba JM, Losada M, Serrano A | title = Functional complementation of yeast cytosolic pyrophosphatase by bacterial and plant H+-translocating pyrophosphatases | journal = Proc.

== Classification ==
Full-length members of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase family have been sequenced from numerous bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. These H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pumping enzymes, which are probably homodimeric, have been reported to fall into two phylogenetic subfamilies.&lt;ref name="Belogurov_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belogurov GA, Turkina MV, Penttinen A, Huopalahti S, Baykov AA, Lahti R | title = H+-pyrophosphatase of Rhodospirillum rubrum.

However, exceptions may exist.&lt;ref name="Belogurov_2002" /&gt; It is not sure whether K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is transported.

The archaeon, ''[[Methanosarcina]]'' ''mazei'' Gö1, encodes within its genome two H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-translocating [[pyrophosphatase]]s (PPases), Mvp1 and Mvp2. Mvp1 resembles bacterial PPases while Mvp2 resembles plant PPases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bäumer S, Lentes S, Gottschalk G, Deppenmeier U | title = Identification and analysis of proton-translocating pyrophosphatases in the methanogenic archaeon Methansarcina mazei | journal = Archaea | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–7 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 15803653 | pmc = 2685546 | doi = 10.1155/2002/371325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mvp2 was shown to translocate 1 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; per pyrophosphate hydrolyzed.

Some PPases from ''[[Anaerostipes caccae]]'', ''Chlorobium limicola'', ''[[Clostridium tetani]]'', and ''[[Desulfuromonas acetoxidans]]'' have been identified as K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transporters.&lt;ref name="Luoto_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luoto HH, Belogurov GA, Baykov AA, Lahti R, Malinen AM | title = Na+-translocating membrane pyrophosphatases are widespread in the microbial world and evolutionarily precede H+-translocating pyrophosphatases | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 286 | issue = 24 | pages = 21633–42 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21527638 | pmc = 3283130 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M111.244483 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phylogenetic analysis led to the identification of a monophyletic clade comprising characterized and predicted Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-transporting PPases (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases) within the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent subfamily. H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-transporting PPases (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases) are more heterogeneous and form at least three independent clades in both subfamilies.&lt;ref name="Luoto_2011" /&gt;

== Function ==
The plant enzymes probably pump one H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; upon hydrolysis of pyrophosphate, thereby generating a [[proton motive force]], positive and acidic in the tonoplast lumen. They establish a pmf of similar magnitude to that generated by the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-translocating ATPases in the same vacuolar membrane. The bacterial and archaeal proteins may catalyze fully reversible reactions, thus being able to synthesize pyrophosphate when the pmf is sufficient. The enzyme from ''R. rubrum'' contributes to the pmf when light intensity is insufficient to generate a pmf sufficient in magnitude to support rapid ATP synthesis. Both C-termini of the [[Protein dimer|dimeric]] subunits of V-PPase are on the same side of the membrane, and they are close to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu TH, Hsu SH, Huang YT, Lin SM, Huang TW, Chuang TH, Fan SK, Fu CC, Tseng FG, Pan RL | title = The proximity between C-termini of dimeric vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase determined using atomic force microscopy and a gold nanoparticle technique | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 276 | issue = 16 | pages = 4381–94 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19614743 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07146.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmembrane domain 6 of vacuolar H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-[[pyrophosphatase]] appears to mediate both protein targeting and proton transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pan YJ, Lee CH, Hsu SH, Huang YT, Lee CH, Liu TH, Chen YW, Lin SM, Pan RL | title = The transmembrane domain 6 of vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase mediates protein targeting and proton transport | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1807 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–67 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20937245 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbabio.2010.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases is:&lt;blockquote&gt;pyrophosphate (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (cytoplasm) → inorganic phosphate (2 P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (external milieu or vacuolar lumen).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Structure ==
Eukaryotic members of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase family are large proteins of about 770 amino acyl residues (aas) with 15 or 16 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). The N-termini are predicted to be in the vacuolar lumen while the C-termini are thought to be in the cytoplasm. These proteins exhibit a region that shows convincing sequence similarity to the regions surrounding the DCCD-sensitive glutamate in the C-terminal regions of the c-subunits of F-type ATPases ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.A.2 TC #3.A.2]). The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-pyrophosphatase of ''[[Streptomyces coelicolor]]'' has been shown to have a 17 TMS topology with the substrate binding domain exposed to the cytoplasm. The C-terminus is hydrophilic with a single C-terminal TMS. The basic structure is believed to have 16 TMSs with several large cytoplasmic loops containing functional motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mimura H, Nakanishi Y, Hirono M, Maeshima M | title = Membrane topology of the H+-pyrophosphatase of Streptomyces coelicolor determined by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 33 | pages = 35106–12 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15187077 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M406264200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several acidic residues in the ''[[Arabidopsis]]'' H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase have been shown to be important for function. Some plants possess closely related H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase isoforms. These enzymes have the enzyme commission number [[EC 3.6.1.1]].

Lin et al. (2012) reported the crystal structure of a ''[[Vigna radiata]]'' H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase (VrH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase) in complex with a non-hydrolysable substrate analogue, imidodiphosphate (IDP), at 2.35 Å resolution. Each VrH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPase subunit consists of an integral membrane domain formed by 16 transmembrane helices.&lt;ref name="Lin_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin SM, Tsai JY, Hsiao CD, Huang YT, Chiu CL, Liu MH, Tung JY, Liu TH, Pan RL, Sun YJ | title = Crystal structure of a membrane-embedded H+-translocating pyrophosphatase | journal = Nature | volume = 484 | issue = 7394 | pages = 399–403 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22456709 | doi = 10.1038/nature10963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IDP is bound in the cytosolic region of each subunit and trapped by numerous charged residues and five Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. A previously undescribed proton translocation pathway is formed by six core transmembrane helices. Proton pumping can be initialized by PP(i) hydrolysis, and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is then transported into the vacuolar lumen through a pathway consisting of Arg 242, Asp 294, Lys 742 and Glu 301. Lin et al. (2012) proposed a working model of the mechanism for the coupling between proton pumping and PP(i) hydrolysis by H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-PPases.

      <text bytes="3996" xml:space="preserve">[[File:Hydras (8).JPG|thumb|upright|Generally sessile ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' attached to a substrate]]

'''Sessility''' is the [[biology|biological]] property of an [[organism]] describing its lack of a means of self-locomotion.  Absent natural ''[[motility]]'' sessile organisms are normally immobile. This is distinct from the [[sessility (botany)|botanical]] meaning of sessility, which refers to an organism or biological structure attached directly by its base without a stalk.

Sessile organisms can move via external forces (such as water currents), but are usually permanently attached to something. Organisms such as [[coral]]s lay down their own [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] from which they grow.  Other sessile organisms grow from a solid such as a rock, dead tree trunk, or a manmade object such as a buoy or ship's hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Biology of the Invertebrates|last=Pechenik|first=Jan|date=2016|ISBN=9781497006515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobility==
Sessile animals typically have a motile phase in their development. [[Sponge]]s have a motile [[larval]] stage, which becomes sessile at maturity. In contrast, many [[jellyfish]] develop as sessile [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s early in their life cycle. In the case of the [[cochineal]], it is in the nymph stage (also called the crawler stage) that the cochineal disperses. The juveniles move to a feeding spot and produce long wax filaments. Later they move to the edge of the cactus pad where the wind catches the wax filaments and carries the tiny larval cochineals to a new host.

==Reproduction==
Many sessile animals, including sponges, [[coral]]s and [[hydra (genus)|hydra]], are capable of [[asexual reproduction]] ''[[in situ]]'' by the process of [[budding]].  Sessile organisms such as [[barnacle]]s and [[tunicate]]s need some mechanism to move their young into new territory. This is why the most widely accepted theory explaining the [[evolution]] of a [[larva]]l stage is the need for long-distance dispersal ability. Biologist [[Wayne Sousa]]'s 1979 study in intertidal disturbance added support for the theory of nonequilibrium community structure, “suggesting that open space is necessary for the maintenance of diversity in most communities of sessile organisms.”&lt;ref&gt;WP. Ecology. 1979. Disturbance in Marine Intertidal Boulder Fields: The Nonequilibrium maintenance of species diversity. http://bio.classes.ucsc.edu/bio170/Readings/sousa%201979.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clumping==
{{Main Article|Clumping (biology)}}
[[File:Blue mussel clump.jpg|thumb|280px|Blue mussels, ''[[Mytilus edulis]]'', are sessile and exhibit clumping]]

'''Clumping''' is a behavior in sessile organisms, in which individuals of a particular species group closely to one another for beneficial purposes, and can be seen in [[coral reef]]s and cochineal populations. This allows for faster reproduction and better protection from predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates|author=James H. Thorp|author2=Alan P. Covich |publisher=[[Academic Press]]|page=213|date=2001|isbn=0-12-690647-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aj2ZMSekmHEC&amp;dq=Sessile+Limnology&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predominance in coastal environments==
The [[littoral zone|circalittoral zone]] of [[coast]]al environments and [[biome]]s are dominated by sessile organisms such as [[oyster]]s. [[Carbonate platform]]s grow due to the buildup of skeletal remains of sessile organisms, usually [[microorganism]]s, which induce carbonate precipitation through their metabolism.

==Botanical sessility==
In anatomy and botany, ''sessility'' refers to an organism or biological structure that has no ''peduncle'' or stalk. See [[peduncle (anatomy)]], [[peduncle (botany)]] and [[sessility (botany)]]. A sessile structure has no stalk.

[[Charles Darwin]] first recognized this phenomenon, though the term was later coined by Huber in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huber|first=B|date=1939|title=Siebrohrensystem unserer Baume und seine jahreszeitlichen Veranderungen.|url=|journal=Jahrbücher für Wissenschaftliche Botanik|volume=88|pages=176–242|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin explained the idea of phylogenetic inertia based on his observations; he spoke about it when explaining the "Law of Conditions of Existence".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Darwin also suggested that, after [[speciation]], the [[organism]]s do not start over from scratch, but have characteristics that are built upon already existing ones that were inherited from their ancestors; and these characteristics likely limit the amount of evolution seen in that new [[Taxon|taxa]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shanahan|first=Timothy|date=2011|title=Phylogenetic Inertia and Darwin's Higher Law|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49816525|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the main concept of phylogenetic inertia.

[[Richard Dawkins]] also explained these constraints by likening [[natural selection]] to a river in his 1982 book ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extended Phenotype: The Gene as a Unit of Selection|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of phylogenetic inertia ==

=== Body plan ===

*[[File:Fishapod evolution.jpg|alt=Sown here is a cladogram of the best known transitional fossils. From bottom to top: Eusthenopteron, Panderichthys, Tiktaalik, Acanthostega, Ichthyostega, Pederpes.|thumb|229x229px|Evolution of fish to tetrapods.  The basic body plan has been phylogenetically constrained.]]Most terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s have a [[body plan]] that consist of four limbs. The phylogenetic inertia hypothesis suggests that this body plan is observed, not because it happens to be optimal, but because [[Evolution of tetrapods|tetrapods]] are derived from a [[clade]] of [[fish]]es ([[Sarcopterygii]]) which also have four limbs. Four limbs happened to be suitable means of locomotion, and so this body plan has not been selected against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewin|first=Roger|date=1980|title=Evolutionary Theory Under Fire|url=|journal=Science|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Human]]s do not have optimal structure for [[bipedalism]], because much of the human body plan originally evolved under [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] locomotion, and has since been constrained because of phylogenetic inertia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gould|first=S. J.|last2=Lewontin|first2=R. C.|date=1979-09-21|title=The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=205|issue=1161|pages=581–598|doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086|issn=0962-8452|pmid=42062|bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..581G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modes of reproduction ===

[[Bird]]s are the only speciose group of vertebrates that are exclusively [[Oviparity|oviparous]], or egg laying. It has been suggested that birds are phylogenetically constrained, as being derived from [[reptile]]s, and likely have not overcome this constraint or diverged far enough away to develop [[viviparity]], or live birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKitrick|first=Mary|date=1993|title=Phylogenetic Constraint in Evolutionary Theory: Has it any Explanatory Power?|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=24|pages=307–330|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.24.110193.001515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Daniel|last2=Evans|first2=Howard|date=1986|title=Why are there no Viviparous Birds?|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=128|issue=2|pages=165–190|doi=10.1086/284552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homologous structures ===

* More specifically than the similarity in body plan, there are [[homology (biology)|homologous]] bones across [[mammal]]ian taxa. For example, the [[pentadactyl limb]] bone structure observed in the arms of [[primate]]s, front legs of equestrians, in the wings of [[bat]]s, and the flippers of [[Seal (animal)|seals]].

'''FAM63B''' is a [[protein]] which in humans is encoded by the [[gene]] FAM63B. This gene is highly expressed in humans. The FAM63B gene is also highly conserved throughout evolutionary history. The discovered function of FAM63B is an interaction with the kinesin-1 light chain and the transportation of [[Vaccinia|vaccinia virus]] from the nucleus to the cell periphery.

== Gene ==

=== Locus ===
FAM63B is located at 15q21.3-q22.1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UCSC Genome Browser|url=https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&amp;lastVirtModeType=default&amp;lastVirtModeExtraState=&amp;virtModeType=default&amp;virtMode=0&amp;nonVirtPosition=&amp;position=chr15%3A58770007-58856406&amp;hgsid=491653739_Mbxka4ZJG2vt43tYvakMCyt1i2AF}}&lt;/ref&gt; spanning 90,707 base pairs on [[chromosome 15]].&lt;ref name="nih.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?LinkName=nuccore_gene&amp;from_uid=1003088783|title=FAM63B family with sequence similarity 63 member B [Homo sapiens (human)] - Gene - NCBI|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FAM63B locus.jpg|FAM63B locus]]

=== Alternative Names ===
The full name of FAM63B is family with sequence similarity 63, member B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=FAM63B&amp;keywords=FAM63B|website=GeneCards|title=Aliases for FAM63B Gene}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAM63B is also listed by its alias, KIAA1164, in some publications.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=FAM63B&amp;keywords=FAM63B&lt;/ref&gt;

== mRNA ==

== Protein ==

=== Structure ===
[[File:FAM63B protein structure.jpg|thumb|right|Structure of FAM63B protein showing the domain of unknown function, bipartite tryptophan binding motif, hydrophobic stretchm, and KDEL signal.]]

==== Primary Structure ====
FAM63B is a member of the [[Pfam]] super family, and contains a domain of unknown function (DUF544) that is homologous within the protein family.&lt;ref name="nih.gov"/&gt; FAM63B protein variant an also contains a [[wikt:bipartite|bipartite]] tryptophan binding motif from W476 to W533.&lt;ref&gt;Dodding, M. P., Mitter, R., Humphries, A. C., &amp; Way, M. (2011). A [[Kinesin|kinesin-1]] binding motif in [[vaccinia]] virus that is widespread throughout the human genome. The EMBO Journal, 30(22), 4523–4538. http://doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2011.326&lt;/ref&gt; Variant a of the protein also contains a hydrophobic stretch of alanine from 567 to 574 and a mixed charge sequence from residue 598 to 617.&lt;ref name="sdsc.edu"/&gt; FAM63B protein may contain a signal sequence specifying return to the endoplasmic reticulum (KDEL) from residue 607 to 621 in variant a.

==== Secondary Structure ====
The secondary structure of FAM63B is a combination of coils, some [[α-helices]], and few [[β-sheets]].&lt;ref name="sdsc.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ic.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/phyre2_output/af64ab84316a975b/summary.html|title=Phyre 2 Results for Undefined|work=ic.ac.uk}}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/|title=I-TASSER server for protein structure and function prediction|work=umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Phyre 2 program predicts α-helices in 23% of the protein, β-strands in 9% of the protein, and the remaining 59% of the protein as disordered.&lt;ref name="ic.ac.uk"/&gt; The disordered regions coincide with the coiled regions predicted by other programs, and this results in the long stretch of coiled protein beginning at the N-terminus. According to the SOUSI program, there is a 16-amino acid-long span from residues 265 to 280 of FAM63B that could be a transmembrane sequence.&lt;ref name="expasy.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expasy.org/proteomics/post-translational_modification|title=ExPASy: SIB Bioinformatics Resource Portal - Categories|work=expasy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, transmembrane sequences generally need to be at least 20 amino acids long in order to be stable in the membrane, so a transmembrane sequence is unlikely. Therefore, FAM63B is not fixed in the membrane of any organelle and is free to move through the cell and between organelles.

==== Tertiary Structure ====
Not much is known about the tertiary structure of FAM63B. A predicted folding is shown.

|}

=== Subcellular Location ===
FAM63B has predicted NES ([[nuclear export signals]]) at Val274 and Leu277.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/webface2.fcgi?jobid=5716AACA000019874EC1B1F0&amp;wait=20|title=5716AACA000019874EC1B1F0 expired|work=dtu.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a NLS ([[nuclear localization signal]]) is predicted for FAM63B at RKRK at residue 599.&lt;ref name="expasy.org" /&gt; In agreement, Reinhardt's method for cytoplasmic/nuclear discrimination predicts FAM63B to be located in the nucleus with a reliability of 76.7%. The presence of both NLS and NES signals and [[O-GlcNAc]] post-translational modification of FAM63B supports the protein's location in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and the discovered protein function as a shuttle for vaccinia virus between the nucleus and the cell periphery.

== Expression ==

=== Expression Level ===
FAM63B has moderately-high to high expression and is constitutively expressed. FAM63B is likely [[ubiquitously]] expressed in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/clust.cgi?UGID=2060133&amp;TAXID=9606&amp;SEARCH=FAM63B|title=Family with sequence similarity 63, member B (FAM63B)|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differential Expression ===
Expression of FAM63B is high in the embryonic stem cells and differentiated tissues but low or off in [[Embryoid body|embryoid bodies]] and other [[Progenitor cell|progenitor]] cells, such as the [[multipotent]] [[mesenchymal stem cells]]. It is likely that FAM63B is expressed during [[pluripotency]] and [[unipotency]] but is not important for differentiation, as is occurring in embryoid bodies, mesenchymal stem cells, and other progenitor cells.

=== Regulation of Expression ===

==== Transcriptional Regulation ====
The promoter of FAM63B is GXP_5885, located on the positive strand of chromosome 15 from (58770692, 58771462) and is 711 base pairs long.&lt;ref name="genomatix.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genomatix.de/cgi-bin//eldorado/eldorado.pl?s=40f88fb88bb64f3f83263645b98dcf85;SHOW_ANNOTATION=FAM63B;ELDORADO_VERSION=E30R1410|title=Genomatix: Annotation &amp; Analysis|work=genomatix.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interacting Proteins ==
FAM63B is shown to interact with one protein, [[KLC1|KLC-1]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Dodding, M. P., Mitter, R., Humphries, A. C., &amp; Way, M. (2011). A kinesin-1 binding motif in vaccinia virus that is widespread throughout the human genome. The EMBO Journal, 30(22), 4523–4538. http://doi.org/10.1038/emboj.2011.326&lt;/ref&gt; KLC-1, kinesin light chain 1, is a protein which recruits kinesin-1 via its cargo binding light chain and contains a bipartite tryptophan binding motif.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This motif is present in a vaccinia virus integral membrane protein, A36, that is required for transport of the virus from the perinuclear space to the cell periphery.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the absence of A36, proteins with a bipartite tryptophan binding motif can interact with the kinesin light chain, recruit KLC-1, and promote virus transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Function ==
The discovered function of FAM63B protein is a transporter of vaccinia virus in the human genome. FAM63B contains a bipartite tryptophan binding motif between W476 and W533.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The motif also contains a [[Glutamine|Q residue]] at the +2 position, which was found to be a frequent occurrence in proteins that bind KLC-1 or KLC-2.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; FAM63B is among proteins studied that can rescue virus transport to the cell periphery when expressed in A36-deficient cells, successfully replacing the cytoplasmic domain A36 of vaccinia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Clinical Significance ==

=== Pathology ===
The specific pathology of FAM63B is unknown.

=== Disease Association ===
FAM63B is part of four networks regulated by miRNA, three of which are linked to neuronal differentiation and [[dopaminergic]] gene expression.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Aberg, K. A., et al. (2014). Methylome-Wide Association Study of Schizophrenia. JAMA Psychiatry, 71(3), 255–264. http://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.3730&lt;/ref&gt; These findings indicate that FAM63B could be used as a biomarker for the detection and treatment of [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Furthermore, aberrant methylation of FAM63B may play a role in the development of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; FAM63B has also been ranked 13 of 25 on a list of associated genes relevant to [[arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;Li, C., et al. (2008). A systematic method for mapping multiple loci: An application to construct a genetic network for rheumatoid arthritis. Gene, 408(1–2), 104–111. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2007.10.028&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homology ==

=== Paralogs ===
FAM63B has one paralog, [[FAM63A]], which is a gene of unknown function. FAM63A gene encodes a protein that is 469 amino acids long and 76% similar to FAM63B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/55793|title=FAM63A family with sequence similarity 63 member A [Homo sapiens (human)] - Gene - NCBI|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orthologs ===
FAM63B has been found in all multicellular and unicellular eukaryotes, including plants but excluding protists and fungi. The gene has also been found in archaea but not bacteria.&lt;ref name="nih.gov1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi|title=BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool|work=nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distant Homologs ===
The most distant homolog of FAM63B is found in ''Thermoplasmatales archaeon'', an [[archaea]] that diverged from the human gene 4.25 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="nih.gov1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timetree.org/search/pairwise/9606/215775?|title=TimeTree|work=timetree.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homologous Domains ===
FAM63B is a member of the Pfam super family, and contains a domain of unknown function (DUF544) homologous within the protein family.&lt;ref name="nih.gov1"/&gt; This region of the protein is highly conserved through FAM63B homologs, as is the bipartite tryptophan binding motif of FAM63B and the C-terminus signal sequence.

=== Phylogeny ===
The phylogenetic tree below shows a time calibration for the evolution of FAM63B.
[[File:FAM63B phylogenic tree.jpg|thumb|none|The phylogenetic tree from TimeTree shows a time calibration for the evolution of FAM63B among humans (Has), prairie voles (Moc), polar bears (Uma), Western clawed frogs (Xtr), and Western Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae, Lch). The fish is the most diverged, followed by the amphibian, and the mammals, especially humans, are the least diverged. This is as expected in accordance with the evolutionary history of organisms on Earth, and FAM63B shows no great exception to the rule.]]

A '''merodiploid''' is a partially diploid bacterium, which has its own [[chromosome]] complement and a chromosome fragment introduced by [[Conjugation (acid-base theory)|conjugation]], transformation or [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=merodiploid|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/merodiploid|journal=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as an essentially haploid [[organism]] that carries a second copy of a part of its genome. The term is derived from the Greek, meros = part, and was originally used to describe both unstable partial diploidy, such as that which occurs briefly in recipients after mating with an Hfr strain (1), and the stable state, exemplified by F-prime strains (see Hfr'S And F-Primes). Over time the usage has tended to confine the term to descriptions of stable genetic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://what-when-how.com/molecular-biology/merodiploids-molecular-biology/|title=Merodiploids (Molecular Biology)|website=What-when-how.com|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Merodiploidy''' refers to the partial duplication of chromosomes in a haploid organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Natural Genetic Transformation Generates a Population of Merodiploids in Streptococcus pneumoniae|first1=Calum |last1= Johnston |first2=Stéphanie |last2=Caymaris |first3=Aldert |last3=Zomer|first4=Hester J. |last4=Bootsma|first5=Marc |last5=Prudhomme|first6=Chantal |last6=Granadel|first7= Peter W.

A '''biological rule''' or '''biological law''' is a generalized [[law (science)|law]], [[principle]], or [[rule of thumb]] formulated to describe patterns observed in living organisms. Biological rules and laws are often developed as succinct, broadly applicable ways to explain complex phenomena or salient observations about the [[ecology]] and [[biogeography|biogeographical]] distributions of plant and animal [[species]] around the world, though they have been proposed for or extended to all types of organisms. Many of these regularities of ecology and biogeography are named after the biologists who first described them.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jørgensen |first1=Sven Erik |title=Explanation of ecological rules and observation by application of ecosystem theory and ecological models|journal=Ecological Modelling |volume=158 |issue=3 |year=2002 |pages=241–248 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allee |first=W.C. |last2=Schmidt |first2=K.P. |date=1951 |title=Ecological Animal Geography |url=https://archive.org/details/ost-geography-ecologicalanimal030544mbp |edition=2nd |pages=457, 460–472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the birth of their science, biologists have sought to explain apparent regularities in observational data. In [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], [[Aristotle]] inferred rules governing differences between live-bearing [[tetrapod]]s (in modern terms, terrestrial placental [[mammal]]s). Among his rules were that [[brood size]] decreases with adult body mass, while [[life expectancy|lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]] and with body mass, and [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan. Thus, for example, elephants have smaller and fewer broods than mice, but longer lifespan and gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rules like these concisely organized the sum of knowledge obtained by early scientific measurements of the natural world, and could be used as [[scientific model|models]] to predict future observations. Among the earliest biological rules in modern times are those of [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] (from 1828 onwards) on [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]],&lt;ref name=Lovtrup/&gt; and of [[Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger]] on animal pigmentation, in 1833.&lt;ref name=Gloger/&gt;
There is some [[scepticism]] among biogeographers about the usefulness of general rules. For example, J.C. Briggs, in his 1987 book ''Biogeography and Plate Tectonics'', comments that while [[Willi Hennig]]'s rules on [[cladistics]] "have generally been helpful", his progression rule is "suspect".&lt;ref name="Briggs1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |first=J.C. |title=Biogeography and Plate Tectonics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCNG2e5K-YgC&amp;pg=PA11 |year=1987 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-086851-6 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

* '''[[Allen's rule]]''' states that the body shapes and proportions of endotherms vary by climatic temperature by either minimizing exposed surface area to minimize heat loss in cold climates or maximizing exposed surface area to maximize heat loss in hot climates. It is named after [[Joel Asaph Allen]] who described it in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Joel Asaph |last=Allen |title=The influence of Physical conditions in the genesis of species |journal=Radical Review |year=1877 |volume=1 |pages=108–140 |url=http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/biogeog/ALLE1877.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barry Holstun |last=Lopez |year=1986 |title=Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape

* '''[[Bateson's rule]]''' states that extra legs are mirror-symmetric with their neighbours, such as when an extra leg appears in an insect's leg socket. It is named after the pioneering geneticist [[William Bateson]] who observed it in 1894. It appears to be caused by the leaking of positional signals across the limb-limb interface, so that the extra limb's polarity to be reversed.&lt;ref name="HeldSessions2019"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |last2=Sessions |first2=Stanley K. |title=Reflections on Bateson's rule: Solving an old riddle about why extra legs are mirror‐symmetric |journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution |volume=332 |issue=7 |year=2019 |pages=219–237 |issn=1552-5007 |doi=10.1002/jez.b.22910|pmid=31613418 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bergmann's rule]]''' states that within a broadly distributed taxonomic [[clade]], populations and species of larger size are found in colder environments, and species of smaller size are found in warmer regions. It applies with exceptions to many mammals and birds. It was named after [[Carl Bergmann (anatomist) |Carl Bergmann]] who described it in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Miguel Á. |last1=Olalla-Tárraga  |first2=Miguel Á. |last2=Rodríguez  |first3=Bradford A. |last3=Hawkins |year=2006 |title=Broad-scale patterns of body size in squamate reptiles of Europe and North America |journal=[[Journal of Biogeography]] |volume=33 |issue=5 |pages=781–793 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01435.x |url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/8rh6d1qg }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Timofeev2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Timofeev | first=S.

In the case of marine [[crustacean]]s, it has been proposed that the increase in size with depth occurs for the same reason as the increase in size with [[latitude]] (Bergmann's rule): both trends involve increasing size with decreasing temperature.&lt;ref name="Timofeev"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Timofeev | first=S.

* '''[[Hennig's progression rule]]''' states that when considering a group of species in [[cladistics]], the species with the most primitive characters are found within the earliest part of the area, which will be the center of origin of that group.

* '''[[Rapoport's rule]]''' states that the [[latitude |latitudinal]] ranges of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s are generally smaller at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes.

* '''[[Schmalhausen's law]]''', named after [[Ivan Schmalhausen]], states that a [[population]] at the extreme limit of its tolerance in any one aspect is more vulnerable to small differences in any other aspect. Therefore, the variance of data is not simply noise interfering with the detection of so-called "main effects", but also an indicator of stressful conditions leading to greater vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lewontin, Richard |author1link=Richard Lewontin |author2=Levins, Richard |title=Schmalhausen's Law |journal=Capitalism, Nature, Socialism |volume=11 |issue=4 |year=2000 |pages=103–108 |doi=10.1080/10455750009358943 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Van Valen's law]]''' states that the probability of [[extinction]] for species and higher taxa (such as families and orders) is constant for each group over time; groups grow neither more resistant nor more vulnerable to extinction, however old their lineage is.

* '''[[von Baer's laws (embryology) |von Baer's laws]]''', discovered by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]], state that [[embryo]]s start from a common form and develop into increasingly specialised forms, so that the diversification of embryonic form mirrors the [[tree of life (biology) |taxonomic and phylogenetic tree]]. Therefore, all animals in a phylum share a similar early embryo; animals in smaller taxa (classes, orders, families, genera, species) share later and later embryonic stages. This was in sharp contrast to the [[recapitulation theory]] of [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]] (and later of [[Ernst Haeckel]]), which claimed that embryos went through stages resembling adult organisms from successive stages of the ''[[scala naturae]]'' from supposedly lowest to highest levels of organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Opitz |first1=John M. |last2=Schultka |first2=Rüdiger |last3=Göbbel |first3=Luminita |title=Meckel on developmental pathology |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A |date=2006 |volume=140A |issue=2 |pages=115–128 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31043 |pmid=16353245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garstang |first1=Walter |authorlink=Walter Garstang |title=The Theory of Recapitulation: A Critical Re-statement of the Biogenetic Law |journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology |date=1922 |volume=35 |issue=232 |pages=81–101 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1922.tb00464.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lovtrup&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lovtrup |first1=Soren |title=On von Baerian and Haeckelian Recapitulation |journal=Systematic Zoology |date=1978 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=348–352 |doi=10.2307/2412887 |jstor=2412887 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Williston's law]]''', first noticed by [[Samuel Wendell Williston]], states that parts in an organism tend to become reduced in number and greatly specialized in function.

Considering the fact that once one X chromosome is inactivated in a cell,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gartler|first=S. M.|last2=Riggs|first2=A. D.|date=1983-01-01|title=Mammalian X-chromosome inactivation|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|volume=17|pages=155–190|doi=10.1146/annurev.ge.17.120183.001103|issn=0066-4197|pmid=6364959}}&lt;/ref&gt; all other cells derived from it will have the same X chromosome inactivated, this approach becomes a great tool to differentiate a monoclonal population from a polyclonal  one in a female tissue. HUMARA gene, in particular, has three important features that make it highly convenient for the purpose.

1-) The gene is located on X chromosome and it goes through inactivation by methylation in normal [[embryogenesis]] of a female infant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The fact that most-but not all-genes on X chromosome undergo inactivation, this feature becomes an important one.

2-) Human Androgen Receptor gene [[allele]]s have varying numbers of CAG repeats.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=R. C.|last2=Zoghbi|first2=H. Y.|last3=Moseley|first3=A. B.|last4=Rosenblatt|first4=H. M.|last5=Belmont|first5=J. W.|date=1992-12-01|title=Methylation of HpaII and HhaI sites near the polymorphic CAG repeat in the human androgen-receptor gene correlates with X chromosome inactivation|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=51|issue=6|pages=1229–1239|issn=0002-9297|pmc=1682906|pmid=1281384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when [[DNA]] from a healthy female tissue is amplified by [[PCR]] for a specific region of the gene, two separated bands can be seen on the gel.

3-) The region that is amplified by PCR also has certain base orders that make it susceptible to be digested by [[HpaII]] (or HhaI) enzyme when it is not methylated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This detail gives the opportunity to researchers to differentiate a methylated allele from the unmethylated one.

Thanks to these qualities of HUMARA gene, clonal origin of any tissue from a female mammalian organism can be determined.

The basic process is performed as the following :

1-) DNA from the tissue is isolated.

2-) The isolated DNA is treated with the suitable enzyme (such as HpaII) in optimal conditions for a suggested amount of time (i.e. overnight).

3-) DNA is cleaned and the certain region of HUMARA gene is amplified by PCR using "suitable" primers (as an example, please see:Ref.2)

4-) After running PCR products through a gel, the gel is visualized and the results are analyzed accordingly. If two bands are apparent, the tissue studied is most likely of polyclonal origin. If a single band is observed, the tissue is monoclonal unless two alleles have exactly the same numbers of CAG repeats or different cells with the same inactivated initiated the tumor; so, seemingly monoclonal although it is actually polyclonal.

In order to make a conclusion about the clonality of a tumor, it is best to use the DNA from a normal tissue of the same person, and a sample without enzyme treatment must also be amplified as a control. If, even in normal tissues without enzyme treatment, a single band is observed, it may be explained as follows; this person has the genetic pattern as XO (this possibility can be excluded to see a band after enzyme treatment because, if indeed XO is the genetic pattern of the sample, then, there will be NO methylation, therefore no band should be visible after digesting with the enzyme. In the case of seeing a band after enzyme treatment, the observation is most likely to mean that the person has two X chromosomes with exact CAG repeats.) When you see two bands for normal tissue (both enzyme treated and untreated), and you see two bands for enzyme treated tumor sample but two bands for untreated tumor DNA, then you are surely looking at a polyclonal tumor. However, if you see the same number of bands only with a single band after enzyme treatment, there is a rather high chance for the tumor of your interest to be monoclonal. In this last case, monoclonality is not for sure because, as stated earlier, there is the possibility of having exact same -CAG- repeats on both alleles.

Beta-adrenergic agonists, or  β-agonists, are non-hormonal growth promotants that help animals put on muscle instead of fat. The more scientifically accepted name for agents of this class is a [[repartitioning agent]], not a growth promotor. [[Ractopamine]] (brand names include Optaflexx and Paylean) and [[zilpaterol]] (brand name Zilmax) received FDA approval in 1999 and 2003, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beta-agonists: What are they and should I be concerned?|url=http://newsroom.unl.edu/announce/beef/2563/14863|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also approved in Mexico, South Africa, and Canada. 160 countries restrict the importation of beef which has been raised with β-agonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beta agonists in cattle debate beefs up|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-01/beta-agonist-debate/5063004|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Temple Grandin]] was one of the first to describe the potential problems with the supplement. Cattle may arrive at the plant with a stiff gait, acting like they have both stiff muscles and sore feet. The problem could be muscle fatigue. Zilpateral enhances the growth of “fast-twitch” fibers, a type of muscle fiber that fatigues more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Temple Grandin Explains Animal Welfare Problems With Beta-Agonists|url=http://www.beefmagazine.com/processors/temple-grandin-explains-animal-welfare-problems-beta-agonists|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 16, 2013 Merck and Co., the makers of Zilmax, suspended the sale of the product in the US and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of Beta-Agonists in Cattle Feed|url=http://extension.psu.edu/animals/beef/nutrition/articles/use-of-beta-agonists-in-cattle-feed|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; But problems may exist with all β-agonists supplementation, and not just for animals.

==Introduction==
The family of β-agonists includes β1-, β2-, and β3-agonists such as [[clenbuterol]], ractopamine, [[cimaterol]], zilpaterol and [[salbutamol]]. They possess similar chemical structures with different [[substituent|substituent groups]] on the [[phenylethanolamines]]. Due to their significant nutrition redistribution function, β-agonists have been applied in the livestock industry such as pigs and [[ruminants]] to reduce carcass fat and increase muscle mass while improving growth rate and [[feed conversion ratio]] (Bareille and Faverdin, 1996, Bergen et al., 1989, Byrem et al., 1998, Cardoso and Taveira, 2002, Shook et al., 2009 and Williams et al., 1987). Unfortunately, β-agonists deposited in animal tissues can cause acute poisoning when consumed by humans, particularly in people with symptoms of muscular tremors, cardiac palpitation, nervousness, headache, muscular pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills (Brambilla et al., 2000). Therefore, the use of β-agonists in animal feeds has been banned in many countries such as the EU and China (Mitchell and Dunnavan, 1998 and Prezelj et al., 2003). There are still illicit usages of β-agonists in animal feeds in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.06.104 | pmid=26304337 | volume=192 | title=Broad screening and identification of β-agonists in feed and animal body fluid and tissues using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry combined with spectra library search | journal=Food Chemistry | pages=188–196| year=2016 | last1=Li | first1=Tingting | last2=Cao | first2=Jingjing | last3=Li | first3=Zhen | last4=Wang | first4=Xian | last5=He | first5=Pingli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broad screening and identification of β-agonists in feed, serum, urine, muscle and liver samples was achieved in a quick and highly sensitive manner using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) combined with a spectra library search. Solid-phase extraction technology was employed for sample purification and enrichment. After extraction and purification, the samples were analyzed using a Q-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer under full-scan and data-dependent MS/MS mode. The acquired mass spectra were compared with an in-house library (compound library and MS/MS mass spectral library) built with TraceFinder Software which contained the M/Z of the precursor ion, chemical formula, retention time, character fragment ions and the entire MS/MS spectra of 32 β-agonist standards. Screening was achieved by comparing 5 key mass spectral results and positive matches were marked. Using the developed method, the identification results from 10 spiked samples and 238 actual samples indicated that only 2% of acquired mass spectra produced false identities. The method validation results showed that the limit of detection ranged from 0.021–3.854 μg kg−1and 0.015–1.198&amp;nbsp;ng mL−1 for solid and liquid samples, respectively.

The '''Lorquin Entomological Society''' is a century-old association of professional and amateur entomologists, biologists and naturalists that meet regularly to study and promote entomology and natural history, especially about wildlife in and near Southern California.

==History==
The '''Lorquin Natural History Club''' was started in June 1913 by [[Fordyce Grinnell Jr.]] A constitution committee was formed in July, and a constitution adopted at the August meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8jm2bvs/admin/ |title=Finding aid to the Fordyce Grinnell, Jr. Papers MS.202 |website=Online Archive of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lorquiniaSep1916"&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 1916 |title=The Lorquin Natural History Club |url=https://archive.org/details/lorquinia112619161918lorq |journal=Lorquinia |volume=1 |issue=2 |publisher=Lorquin Natural History Club |pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after French entomologist [[Pierre Joseph Michel Lorquin]], who collected specimens in California during the [[California Gold Rush]].&lt;ref name="lat13Sep2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Balukjian |first=Brad |date=13 September 2013 |title=A grounded view of the empire of insects |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/la-sci-lorquin-20130915-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early members included not only entomologists like Grinnell, but herpetologists, botanists, an ornithologist, a conchologist, a geologist, and seismologist [[Charles F. Richter]], whose specialty at the time was astronomy.&lt;ref name="lat13Sep2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1916 |title=Cover |url=https://archive.org/details/lorquinia112619161918lorq |journal=Lorquinia |volume=1 |issue=1 |publisher=Lorquin Natural History Club |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="richter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/17/1/OH_Richter_C.pdf |title=Interview with Charles F.

The group was renamed the '''Lorquin Entomological Club''' in 1917 and its meetings moved to the [[Los Angeles Public Library]]. In 1919 the club began meeting in the [[Southwest Museum]] in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles|Highland Park]].&lt;ref name="Martin1972"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Lloyd M. |date=October 20, 1972 |title=John Adams Comstock, 1883-1970 |url=https://archive.org/stream/bulletin7073sout#page/n218/mode/1up |journal=Bulletin |publisher=Southern California Academy of Sciences |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=57–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early club activities included field trips into the hills and canyons beyond the termini of the Red Cars of the [[Pacific Electric]] and the Yellow Cars of the [[Los Angeles Railway]].&lt;ref name="richter" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1916 |title=In the Santa Susanna Mountains |url=https://archive.org/details/lorquinia112619161918lorq |journal=Lorquinia |volume=1 |issue=1 |publisher=Lorquin Natural History Club |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1916 |title=Announcements |url=https://archive.org/details/lorquinia112619161918lorq |journal=Lorquinia |volume=1 |issue=1 |publisher=Lorquin Natural History Club |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an era when a butterfly collector could net over 500 in a single day and take over 100 species in the Los Angeles area.&lt;ref name="Drummond1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drummond |first=Boyce A. |date=1990 |title=Review of ''Butterflies of California'' reprint |url=http://images.peabody.yale.edu/lepsoc/jls/1990s/1990/1990-44(3)206-Drummond.pdf |journal=Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club held their first Butterfly Show February 24–26, 1921, at the Southwest Museum. Among other things it featured a lecture on butterfly hunting, illustrated by [[stereopticon]] slides, by museum director [[John Adams Comstock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1921 |title=Unique Exhibit to be Given |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjAdAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA536 |journal=Los Angeles School Journal |volume=5 |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Butterfly Show became an annual, month-long event, sponsored by the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Museum of History, Science, and Art]].&lt;ref name="EvansHogue2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Arthur V. |last2=Hogue |first2=James N. |date=2004 |title=Introduction to California Beetles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8e_zG9ujZ60C&amp;pg=PA10 |publisher=University of California Press  |pages=10–11 |isbn=978-0-520-24035-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, the Southwest Museum narrowed its scope. Natural history exhibits and specimens were transferred to the Museum of History, Science, and Art.&lt;ref name="Martin1972" /&gt; In January 1927, the club moved its meetings there as well, and changed its name to the Lorquin Entomological Society.&lt;ref name="lat13Sep2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin1972" /&gt; Comstock, who had been director of the Southwest Museum from 1921 to 1926, published his landmark ''Butterflies of California'' in 1927.

Under his influence, and that of his colleague Charles Montagu Dammers, the society's emphasis evolved from collecting to life history studies. Members in the late 1920s and early 1930s included biologists John Shrader Garth, Jeane Daniel Gunder, Lloyd M. Martin, and [[Don Meadows]].&lt;ref name="GarthTilden1986"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garth |first1=John Shrader |last2=Tilden |first2=James Wilson |date=1986 |title=California Butterflies |url=https://archive.org/details/californiabutter00gart |url-access=registration |publisher=University of California Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/californiabutter00gart/page/47 47]–48 |isbn=978-0-520-05249-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, the society decided that California should name a state insect. They prepared ballots listing three butterfly candidates and sent them to entomologists throughout the state. The nominees were the [[Lorquin's admiral]] (''Limenitis lorquini''), the [[Heterochroa californica|California sister]] (''Heterochroa californica''), and the [[Zerene eurydice|California dog head]] or Flying pansy (''Zerene eurydice''). The California dog head won handily, with 77 votes out of 88 cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berenbaum |first=May R. |date=1 April 1993 |title='Politically Correct' Insects |url=http://ae.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/2/68 |journal=American Entomologist |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=68–69 |doi=10.1093/ae/39.2.68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Garvey |first=Kathy Keatley |date=July 22, 2007 |title=Tracking the 'Dogface' |url=http://www.dailydemocrat.com/article/ZZ/20070722/NEWS/707229769 |newspaper=[[Daily Democrat]] |location=Woodland, California}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state legislature took note, and the Bureau of Entomology in the California Department of Agriculture began to use a likeness of the California dog head, labeled "California State Insect" on its documents. No further action took place, however, until 1972, when Assemblyman [[Kenneth L. Maddy]] introduced Assembly Bill No. 1843 to make what was by then known as the California dogface the official state insect. Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] signed the bill into law on July 28, 1972, making California the first in the nation to have a state insect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/insects/ca_insect.htm |title=California State Insect |website=netstate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, [[Steven R. Kutcher]], a member of the society, organized the first annual Insect Fair at the [[Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden]]. It featured exhibits by the society and others, demonstrations, and lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pool |first=Bob |date=March 23, 1991 |title=Insect Aficionados Show and Tell at Arboretum |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-03-23/local/me-541_1_insect-fair |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the fair outgrew the Arboretum, it was moved in 1989 to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (the erstwhile Museum of History, Science, and Art). Eventually the Natural History Museum took over organizing the fair and has done so since.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} What is now known as Bug Fair, and bills itself as "the biggest bug festival in North America", draws 20,000 visitors to its interactive exhibits, vendor tables, and insect menus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ng  |first=David |date=May 13, 2009 |title=Tarantula tempura?

The society has counted as members many academics, authors, and museum curators in the field of entomology, such as brothers John F. and Thomas C. Emmel, Cristopher Henne, [[Charles L. Hogue]] and son James N. 'Jim' Hogue, Noel McFarland, and Rudolf H. T. Mattioni.&lt;ref name="GarthTilden1986" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lorquinentomological.weebly.com/ |title=Home |website=Lorquin Entomological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members are active in research, environmental protection, habitat restoration, species surveys, entomological outreach, and natural history education. As of 2013, membership stood at just over 100. Regular meetings with speakers are held on the fourth Friday of every month, at BioQuip (a biological supply house in Rancho Dominguez)&lt;ref name="lat13Sep2013" /&gt; since remodeling ousted the society from the Natural History Museum in 2009.

==Publications==
The club published eighteen monthly issues of ''Lorquinia'' between August 1916 and January 1919. They contained botanical and entomological papers and notes. Since about 1955, it has published a newsletter (10 issues per year),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=dos Passos |first=Cyril F. |date=1981 |title=Some Little-Known U.S. Publications of Lepidoptera II |url=http://lepidopteraresearchfoundation.org/journals/20/PDF20/20-111.pdf |journal=Journal of Research on the Lepidoptera |volume=20 |issue=2 |publisher= |pages=116–117 |issn=0022-4324}}&lt;/ref&gt; most recently called ''NetWork''. In 1999, it published a book by Robert Lee Allen, ''Stalking the wild arthropod: The Lorquin Entomological Society's guide to photographing arthropods''.

'''Biostasis''' or [[Cryptobiosis]] is the ability of an [[organism]] to tolerate environmental changes without having to actively adapt to them. Biostasis is found in organisms that live in habitats that likely encounter unfavorable living conditions, such as drought, freezing temperatures, change in pH levels, pressure, or temperature. Insects undergo a type of dormancy to survive these conditions, called [[diapause]]. Diapause may be obligatory for these insects to survive. The insect may also be able to undergo change prior to the arrival of the initiating event.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.iwu.edu/~tardisdp/tardigrade_facts.html | title=Tardigrade Facts | author=Karen Lindahl and Susie Balser | date=2 October 1999 | publisher=Illinois Wesleyan University | access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microorganisms==
Biostasis in this context is also synonymous for '''viable but nonculturable state'''. In the past{{when|date=December 2018}} when bacteria were no longer growing on culture media it was assumed that they were dead. Now we can understand that there are many instances where bacteria cells may go into biostasis or suspended animation, fail to grow on media, and on resuscitation are again culturable. VBNC state differs from 'starvation survival state' (where a cell just reduces metabolism significantly). Bacteria cells may enter the VBNC state as a result of some outside stressor such as "starvation, incubation outside the temperature range of growth, elevated osmotic concentrations (seawater), oxygen concentrations, or exposure to white light" (9). Any of these instances could very easily mean death for the bacteria if it was not able to enter this state of dormancy. It has also been observed that in may instances where it was thought that bacteria had been destroyed (pasteurization of milk) and later caused spoilage or harmful effects to consumers because the bacteria had entered the VBNC state.

Effects on cells entering the VBNC state include "dwarfing, changes in metabolic activity, reduced nutrient transport, respiration rates and macromolecular synthesis". (9) Yet biosynthesis continues, and shock proteins are made. Most importantly has been observed that ATP levels and generation remain high, completely contrary to dying cells which show rapid decreases in generation and retention. Changes to the cell walls of bacteria in the VBNC state have also been observed. In E.coli a large amount of cross-linking was observed in the peptidoglycan. The autolytic capability was also observed to be much higher in VBNC cells than those who were in the growth state.

It is far easier to induce bacteria to the VBNC state and once bacteria cells have entered the VBNC state it is very hard to return them to a culturable state. "They examined nonculturability and resuscitation in &lt;u&gt;Legionella Pneumophila&lt;/u&gt; and while entry into this state was easily induced by nutrient starvation, resuscitation could only be demonstrated following co-incubation of the VBNC cells with the amoeba, &lt;u&gt;Acanthamoeba Castellani&lt;/u&gt;" (9)

'''Fungistasis''' or mycostasis a naturally occurring VBNC (viable but nonculturable) state found in fungi in soil. Watson and Ford defined fungistasis as "when viable fungal propagules, which are not subject to endogenous or constitutive dormancy do not germinate in soil at their favorable temperature or moisture conditions or growth of fungal hyphae is retarded or terminated by conditions of the soil environment other than temperature or moisture." (10). Essentially (and mostly observed naturally occurring in soil) several types of fungi have been found to enter the VBNC state resulting from outside stressors (temperature, available nutrients, oxygen availability etc.) or from no observable stressors at all.

== Current research ==
On March 1, 2018, the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) announced their new Biostasis program under the direction of Dr. Tristan McClure-Begley. The aim of the Biostasis program is to develop new possibilities for extending the [[Golden hour (medicine)|golden hour]] in patients who suffered a traumatic injury by slowing down the human body at the cellular level, addressing the need for additional time in continuously operating biological systems faced with catastrophic, life-threatening events. By leveraging molecular biology, the program aims to control the speed at which living systems operate and figure out a way to "slow life to save life."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2018-03-01|title=Slowing Biological Time to Extend the Golden Hour for Lifesaving Treatment|website=www.darpa.mil|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2018, the Biostasis team held a [[Webinar]] which, along with a [[Broad Agency Announcement]] (BAA), solicited five-year research proposals from outside organizations. The full proposals were due on May 22, 2018.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/Biostasis%20Webinar_Full%20Deck_For%20Posting.pdf|title=Rapid Threat Assessment (RTA)|website=www.darpa.mil|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible approaches ===
In their [[Web conferencing|Webinar]], [[DARPA]] outlined a number of possible research approaches for the Biostasis project. These approaches are based on research into [[diapause]] in [[tardigrade]]s and [[wood frog]]s which suggests that selective stabilization of intracellular machinery occurs at the [[protein]] level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Protein chaperoning ====
In molecular biology, [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] are proteins that assist in the folding, unfolding, assembly, or disassembly of other [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] structures. Under typical conditions, [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] facilitate changes in shape ([[conformational change]]) of [[macromolecule]]s in response to changes in environmental factors like [[temperature]], [[pH]], and [[voltage]]. By reducing conformational flexibility, scientists can constrain the function of certain proteins.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recent research has shown that proteins are promiscuous, or able to do jobs in addition to the ones they evolved to carry out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/the-apromiscuousa-protein|title=The 'Promiscuous' Protein|last=University|first=Massey|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, protein promiscuity plays a key role in the adaptation of species to new environments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is possible that finding a way to control [[conformational change]] in promiscuous proteins could allow scientists to induce biostasis in living organisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Intracellular crowding ====
The crowdedness of cells is a critical aspect of biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/10/how-intracellular-crowding-changes-everything/|title=How Intracellular Crowding Changes Everything|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intracellular crowding refers to the fact that protein function and interaction with water is constrained when the interior of the cell is overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Intracellular [[organelle]]s are either membrane-bound vesicles or membrane-less compartments that compartmentalize the cell and enable [[Spatiotemporal pattern|spatiotemporal]] control of biological reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brangwynne|first=Clifford P.|last2=Tompa|first2=Peter|last3=Pappu|first3=Rohit V.|date=2015-11-03|title=Polymer physics of intracellular phase transitions|journal=Nature Physics|language=En|volume=11|issue=11|pages=899–904|doi=10.1038/nphys3532|issn=1745-2473|bibcode=2015NatPh..11..899B}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By introducing these intracellular [[polymer]]s to a biological system and manipulating the crowdedness of a cell, scientists may be able to slow down the rate of biological reactions in the system.

==== Tardigrade-disordered proteins ====
[[Tardigrade]]s are [[Micro-animal|microscopic animals]] that are able to enter a state of [[diapause]] and survive a remarkable array of environmental stressors, including [[freezing]] and [[desiccation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research has shown that [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] in these organisms may work to stabilize cell function and protect against these extreme environmental stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boothby|first=Thomas C.|last2=Tapia|first2=Hugo|last3=Brozena|first3=Alexandra H.|last4=Piszkiewicz|first4=Samantha|last5=Smith|first5=Austin E.|last6=Giovannini|first6=Ilaria|last7=Rebecchi|first7=Lorena|last8=Pielak|first8=Gary J.|last9=Koshland|first9=Doug|date=2017|title=Tardigrades Use Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Survive Desiccation|url=https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(17)30133-8|journal=Molecular Cell|language=English|volume=65|issue=6|pages=975–984.e5|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2017.02.018|pmid=28306513|pmc=5987194|issn=1097-2765|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using [[peptide]] engineering, it is possible that scientists may be able to introduce [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] to the biological systems of larger animal organisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This could allow larger animals to enter a state of biostasis similar to that of [[tardigrade]]s under extreme biological stress.

When excited at 244 or 388 nm in neutral aqueous solution, methyl green produces a fluorescent emission at 488 or 633 nm respectively. The presence or absence of DNA does not effect these fluorescence behaviors. When binding DNA under neutral aqueous conditions, methyl green also becomes fluorescent in the far red with an excitation maximum of 633 nm and an emission maximum of 677 nm.&lt;ref name="pr2014"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Commercial Methyl green preparations are often contaminated with [[Crystal violet]]. Crystal violet can be removed by [[chloroform]] extraction.&lt;ref name="pr2014"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tactoids''' are [[liquid crystal]] [[wiktionary:microdomain|microdomains]] nucleated in [[isotropic]] phases, which can be distinguished as spherical or spindle-shaped [[birefringence|birefringent]] microdroplets under [[polarized light microscopy]]. Tactoids are a transition state between [[isotropic]] and [[macroscopic]] liquid crystalline phases. The first observation of tactoids was made by Zocher in 1925, when he studied the [[nematic]] phase formed in [[vanadium pentoxide]] [[sol (colloid)|sol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Über freiwillige Strukturbildung in Solen.

'''293T''' (or [[HEK 293T]]) is a human cell line, derived from the [[HEK 293]] cell line, that expresses a mutant version of the [[SV40 large T antigen]].  It is very commonly used in biology for protein expression and production of recombinant [[retroviruses]].

== Origin ==
293T was created in Michele Calos's lab at Stanford by [[transfection#Stable and transient transfection|stable transfection]] of the HEK 293 cell line with a plasmid encoding a temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 large T antigen; it was originally referred to as 293/''tsA1609neo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DuBridge RB, Tang P, Hsia HC, Leong PM, Miller JH, Calos MP |title=Analysis of mutation in human cells by using an Epstein-Barr virus shuttle system |journal=Mol. Cell. Biol. |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=379–387 |date=Jan 1987 |pmid=3031469 |pmc=365079 |doi=10.1128/MCB.7.1.379 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first reference to the cell line as "293T" may be its use to create the [[BOSC23]] packaging cell line for producing retroviral particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pear WS, Nolan GP, Scott ML, Baltimore D |title=Production of high-titer helper-free retroviruses by transient transfection |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=90 |issue=18 |pages=8392–8396 |date=15 Sep 1993 |pmid=7690960 |pmc=47362 |doi=10.1073/pnas.90.18.8392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
The transfection used to create 293T (involving plasmid pRSV-1609) conferred [[neomycin]]/[[G418]] resistance and expression of the tsA1609 allele of SV40 large T antigen; this allele is fully active at 33&amp;nbsp;°C (its [[permissive temperature]]), has substantial function at 37&amp;nbsp;°C, and is inactive at 40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rio DC, Clark SG, Tjian R |title=A mammalian host-vector system that regulates expression and amplification of transfected genes by temperature induction |journal=Science |volume=227 |issue=4682 |pages=23–28 |date=4 Jan 1985 |pmid=2981116 |doi=10.1126/science.2981116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  293T is very efficiently transfectable with DNA (like its parent HEK 293).  Due to the expression of SV40 large T antigen, transfected plasmid DNAs that carry the SV40 [[origin of replication]] can replicate in 293T and will transiently maintain a high copy number; this can greatly increase the amount of recombinant protein or retrovirus that can be produced from the cells.

== Genome ==
The full genome sequences of three different isolates of 293T have been determined.  They are quite similar to each other but show detectable divergence from the parental HEK 293 cell line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin YC, Boone M, Meuris L, Lemmens I, Van Roy N, Soete A, Reumers J, Moisse M, Plaisance S, Drmanac R, Chen J, Speleman F, Lambrechts D, Van de Peer Y, Tavernier J, Callewaert N |title=Genome dynamics of the human embryonic kidney 293 lineage in response to cell biology manipulations |journal=Nat. Commun. |volume=5 |at=4767 |date=3 Sep 2014 |pmid=25182477 |pmc=4166678 |doi=10.1038/ncomms5767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macrobiology''' is the branch of [[biology]] that studies large living organisms (termed Macro organisms) that can be seen by the naked eye. Macrobiology is the opposite of [[Microbiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/science/macro-biology-bfdffb44d78aa221|title=What is macro biology?|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macrocosm and Microcosm'''

Macrocosm and Microcosm is an important concept in Macrobiology. It refers to a vision of [[cosmos]] where the part reflects the whole (macrocosm) and vice versa. It is a feature "present in all esoteric schools of thinking", according to scholar [[Pierre A. Riffard]]. It underlies practices such as [[astrology]], [[alchemy]] and [[sacred geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shekpvar.net/~dna/Publications/Cosmos/cosmos.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412094332/http://www.shekpvar.net/~dna/Publications/Cosmos/cosmos.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-04-12 |title=Cosmos - an Illustrated Dimensional Journey from microcosmos to macrocosmos |access-date=2016-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A transboundary [[breed]] is a breed which is present in several countries.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. August 2012. Intergovernmental Technical Working Group on Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, Seventh Session. http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/026/me588e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Transboundary [[species]] of the five significant [[livestock]] types (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and chickens), have been developed for a hundred years or more in intensive manufacturing systems, which has led to global availability.  A relatively small number of worldwide transboundary breeds compose the ever-increasing share of total global animal products. However, only in [[North America]] and the [[Southwest Pacific]] do the number of transboundary breeds surpass that of local breeds.&lt;ref&gt;Sep. 2013. AgriCultures Network. Livestock breeding and small-scale keepers. http://www.agriculturesnetwork.org/resources/learning/mod4-online/learning-block-2/2.3/2.3.1 accessed Nov. 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

There can be both regional and international types of transboundary breeds. Regional breeds are breeds that are reported to only be found in one "region", which may include several countries, and an international transboundary breed is one that is reported to be found in multiple regions. For example, the Holstein Fresian cattle is an international transboundary breed, because it is found in several different continents and regions.

In [[biology]], '''solenocytes''' are [[flagellate]]d [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s associated with [[excretion]], [[osmoregulation]] and [[ionoregulation]] in many animals and in some [[chordate]]s under the sub-phylum [[Cephalochordate|Cephalochordata]].

These are the cells which form subtypes of [[protonephridium]] along with the other type i.e. [[flame cell]]s. Flame cells can be distinguished from solenocytes as the former is usually [[ciliate]]d whereas the latter is flagellated.

An example of organisms in which excretion is performed by solenocytic protonephridia is the genus ''[[Branchiostoma]].''

{{other uses}}
[[Image:Stained_microscope_slide.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A stained [[histologic]] specimen, sandwiched between a glass [[microscope slide]].]]

'''Staining''' is a technique used to enhance contrast in samples, generally at the [[Microscope|microscopic]] level. Stains and [[dye]]s are frequently used in [[histology]] (the study of tissue under the microscope) and in the [[medical]] fields of [[histopathology]], [[hematology]], and [[cytopathology]] that focus on the study and [[diagnoses]] [[disease]] at a microscopic level. Stains may be used to define [[biological tissues]] (highlighting, for example, [[muscle fiber]]s or [[connective tissue]]), [[cell (biology)|cell]] populations (classifying different [[blood cell]]s), or [[organelle]]s within individual cells.

In [[biochemistry]] it involves adding a class-specific ([[DNA]], [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s) dye to a substrate to qualify or quantify the presence of a specific compound. Staining and [[fluorescent tag]]ging can serve similar purposes. Biological staining is also used to mark cells in [[flow cytometry]], and to flag [[protein]]s or [[nucleic acid]]s in [[gel electrophoresis]].

Staining is not limited to biological materials, it can also be used to study the structure of other materials for example the lamellar structures of semi-crystalline [[polymer]]s or the domain structures of [[block copolymer]]s.

&lt;br /&gt;

== ''In vivo'' vs ''In vitro'' ==
''[[In vivo]] staining'' (also called [[vital staining]] or intravital staining) is the process of dyeing living tissues. By causing certain cells or structures to take on contrasting colour(s), their form ([[Morphology_(biology)|morphology]]) or position within a cell or tissue can be readily seen and studied. The usual purpose is to reveal cytological details that might otherwise not be apparent; however, staining can also reveal where certain chemicals or specific chemical reactions are taking place within cells or tissues.

''[[In vitro]]'' staining involves colouring cells or structures that have been removed from their biological context. Certain stains are often combined to reveal more details and features than a single stain alone.  Combined with specific protocols for [[fixation (histology)|fixation]] and sample preparation, scientists and physicians can use these standard techniques as consistent, repeatable diagnostic tools. A [[counterstain]] is stain that makes cells or structures more visible, when not completely visible with the principal stain.
* For example, [[crystal violet]] stains only [[Gram-positive]] bacteria in [[Gram staining]]. A [[safranin]] counterstain is applied that stains all cells, allowing identification of Gram-negative bacteria.

While ex vivo, many cells continue to live and metabolize until they are "fixed". Some staining methods are based on this property. Those stains excluded by the living cells but taken up by the  already dead cells are called [[vital stain]]s (e.g. [[trypan blue]] or [[propidium iodide]] for eukaryotic cells). Those that enter and stain living cells are called [[supravital stain]]s (e.g. [[New Methylene Blue]] and [[brilliant cresyl blue]] for [[reticulocyte]] staining). However, these stains are eventually toxic to the organism, some more so than others.  Partly due to their toxic interaction inside a living cell, when supravital stains enter a living cell, they might produce a characteristic pattern of staining different from the staining of an already fixed cell (e.g. "reticulocyte" look versus diffuse "polychromasia"). To achieve desired effects, the stains are used in very dilute solutions ranging from {{gaps|1|:|5|000}} to {{gaps|1|:|500|000}} (Howey, 2000). Note that many stains may be used in both living and fixed cells.



== Preparation ==
The preparatory steps involved depend on the type of analysis planned; some or all of the following procedures may be required.

'''[[Fixation (histology)|Fixation]]'''–which may itself consist of several steps–aims to preserve the shape of the cells or tissue involved as much as possible.  Sometimes [[heat fixation]] is used to kill, adhere, and alter the specimen so it accepts stains. Most chemical fixatives (chemicals causing fixation) generate [[chemical bond]]s between [[protein]]s and other substances within the sample, increasing their rigidity.  Common fixatives  include [[formaldehyde]], [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], and/or [[picric acid]].  Pieces of tissue may be embedded in [[paraffin wax]] to increase their mechanical strength and stability and to make them easier to cut into thin slices.

Mordants are classified into two categories:

a) Basic Mordant: React with acidic dyes e.g. alum , ferrous sulfate , cetylpyridinium chloride etc .

b) Acidic Mordant : React with basic dyes e.g. picric acid , tannic acid etc.

&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'''Direct Staining:'''  Carried out without mordant.

'''Permeabilization''' involves treatment of cells with (usually) a mild [[surfactant]].  This treatment dissolves [[cell membrane]]s, and allows larger dye molecules into the cell's interior.

'''[[Microscope slide#Mounting|Mounting]]''' usually involves attaching the samples to a glass microscope slide for observation and analysis.  In some cases, cells may be grown directly on a slide.  For samples of loose cells (as with a blood smear or a [[pap smear]]) the sample can be directly applied to a slide.  For larger pieces of tissue, thin sections (slices) are made using a [[microtome]]; these slices can then be mounted and inspected.

=== Standardization ===

Most of the dyes commonly used in microscopy are available as '''BSC-certified stains'''. This means that samples of the manufacturer's batch have been tested by an independent body, the [[Biological Stain Commission]] ('''BSC'''), and found to meet or exceed certain standards of purity, dye content and performance in staining techniques. These standards are published in the Commission's journal [[Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Penney DP, Powers JM, Frank M, Churukian C |title=Analysis and testing of biological stains—the Biological Stain Commission Procedures |pmid=12564600| journal=Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry |year= 2002 |volume=77|issue=5–6|pages=237–275 |doi=10.1080/714028210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many dyes are inconsistent in composition from one supplier to another. The use of BSC-certified stains eliminates a source of unexpected results.&lt;ref name="HorobinKiernan" /&gt;

Some vendors sell stains "certified" by themselves rather than by the Biological Stain Commission. Such products may or may not be suitable for diagnostic and other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologicalstaincommission.org/vendors-list/|title=Vendors List - The Biological Stain Commission|author=|date=|website=biologicalstaincommission.org|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative staining ===
A simple staining method for bacteria that is usually successful, even when the "positive staining" methods detailed below fail, is to use a [[negative stain]]. This can be achieved by smearing the sample onto the slide and then applying [[nigrosin]] (a black synthetic dye) or [[India ink]] (an aqueous suspension of carbon particles). After drying, the microorganisms may be viewed in bright field microscopy as lighter inclusions well-contrasted against the dark environment surrounding them.&lt;ref&gt;Clark G (1981) ''Staining Procedures'', 4th ed., Baltimore: Williams &amp; Wilkins, p. 412, {{ISBN|0683017071}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Note: negative staining is a mild technique that may not destroy the microorganisms, and is therefore unsuitable for studying pathogens.

== Specific techniques ==

=== Gram staining ===
{{main|Gram staining}}
[[Gram staining]] is used to determine gram status to classify bacteria broadly. It is based on the composition of their [[cell wall]]. Gram staining uses [[Gentian violet|crystal violet]] to stain cell walls, [[iodine]] as a mordant, and a [[fuchsin]] or [[safranin]] counterstain to mark all bacteria. Gram status is important in medicine; the presence or absence of a cell wall changes the bacterium's susceptibility to some [[antibiotic]]s.

[[Gram-positive]] bacteria stain dark blue or violet. Their [[cell wall]] is typically &lt;!-- but not always !! --&gt; rich with [[peptidoglycan]] and lacks the secondary membrane and [[lipopolysaccharide]] layer found in Gram-negative bacteria.

On most Gram-stained preparations, [[Gram-negative]] organisms appear red or pink because they are counterstained. Because of presence of higher lipid content, after alcohol-treatment, the porosity of the cell wall increases, hence the CVI complex (crystal violet – iodine) can pass through. Thus, the primary stain is not retained. Also, in contrast to most Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria have only a few layers of peptidoglycan and a secondary cell membrane made primarily of lipopolysaccharide.

=== Endospore staining ===
{{main|Endospore staining}}
[[Endospore staining]] is used to identify the presence or absence of [[endospore]]s, which make bacteria very difficult to kill. This is particularly useful for identifying endospore-forming bacterial [[pathogen]]s such as ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]''.

=== Ziehl-Neelsen stain ===
{{main|Ziehl-Neelsen stain}}
[[Ziehl-Neelsen stain]]ing is used to stain species of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' that do not stain with the standard laboratory staining procedures such as Gram staining.

The stains used are the red coloured [[Carbol fuchsin]] that stains the bacteria and a counter stain such as [[Methylene blue]]

=== Haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining ===
{{main|H&amp;E stain}}
[[Image:Emphysema H and E.jpg|right|thumb|Microscopic view of a histologic specimen of human [[lung]] tissue stained with [[hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]].]]
[[H&amp;E stain|Haematoxylin and eosin stain]]ing is frequently used in [[histology]] to examine thin tissue sections.&lt;ref name="Bancroft and Stevens, 1982" /&gt;  [[Haematoxylin]] stains cell nuclei blue, while [[eosin]] stains cytoplasm, connective tissue and other extracellular substances pink or red.&lt;ref name="Bancroft and Stevens, 1982" /&gt;  Eosin is strongly absorbed by [[red blood cell]]s, colouring them bright red. In a skillfully made H&amp;E preparation the red blood cells are almost orange, and collagen and cytoplasm (especially muscle) acquire different shades of pink.

=== Papanicolaou staining ===
{{main|Papanicolaou stain}}
[[Papanicolaou stain]]ing, or Pap staining, is a frequently used method for examining cell samples from various bodily secretions. It is frequently used to stain [[Pap smear]] specimens.&lt;ref name="Gill, 2013" /&gt; It uses a combination of [[haematoxylin]], [[Orange G]], [[eosin Y]], [[Light Green SF yellowish]], and sometimes [[Bismarck Brown Y]].&lt;ref name="Bancroft and Stevens, 1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gill, 2013" /&gt;

=== PAS staining ===
{{main|Periodic acid–Schiff stain}}
[[Image:Histoplasma pas-d small.jpg|thumb|right|[[PAS diastase]] showing the fungus [[Histoplasma]].]]
[[Periodic acid-Schiff]] staining is used to mark [[carbohydrate]]s ([[glycogen]], [[glycoprotein]], [[proteoglycan]]s). It is used to distinguish different types of glycogen storage diseases.

=== Masson's trichrome === 
{{main|Masson's trichrome stain}}
[[Masson's trichrome]] is (as the name implies) a three-colour staining protocol.  The recipe has evolved from Masson's original technique for different specific applications, but all are well-suited to distinguish cells from surrounding [[connective tissue]].  Most recipes produce red [[keratin]] and muscle fibers, blue or green staining of [[collagen]] and [[bone]], light red or pink staining of [[cytoplasm]], and black [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]].

=== Romanowsky stains === 
{{main|Romanowsky stain}}
The [[Romanowsky stain]]s are all based on a combination of eosinate (chemically [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] [[eosin]]) and [[methylene blue]] (sometimes with its oxidation products [[azure A]] and [[azure B]]).  Common variants include [[Wright's stain]], [[Jenner's stain]], May-Grunwald stain, [[Leishman stain]] and [[Giemsa stain]].

All are used to examine [[blood]] or [[bone marrow]] samples.  They are preferred over H&amp;E for inspection of blood cells because different types of [[white blood cells|leukocytes]] (white blood cells) can be readily distinguished.  All are also suited to examination of blood to detect blood-borne parasites such as [[malaria]].

=== Silver staining ===

[[Silver stain]]ing is the use of [[silver]] to stain [[histologic section]]s. This kind of staining is important especially to show [[protein]]s (for example type III [[collagen]]) and [[DNA]]. It is used to show both substances inside and outside [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Silver staining is also used in [[temperature gradient gel electrophoresis]].

Some cells are ''argentaffin''. These [[Redox|reduce]] silver solution to metallic silver after [[formalin]] [[fixation (histology)|fixation]]. This method was discovered by Italian [[Camillo Golgi]], by using a reaction between [[silver nitrate]] and [[potassium dichromate]], thus precipitating silver chromate in some cells (see [[Golgi's method]]). Other cells are ''argyrophilic''. These reduce silver solution to metallic silver after being exposed to the stain that contains a [[Reducing agent|reductant]], for example [[hydroquinone]] or formalin.

=== Sudan staining ===
{{main|Sudan stain}}
[[Sudan stain]]ing is the use of Sudan dyes to stain sudanophilic substances, usually [[lipid]]s. [[Sudan III]], [[Sudan IV]], [[Oil Red O]], [[Osmium tetroxide]], and [[Sudan Black B]] are often used. Sudan staining is often used to determine the level of [[fecal fat]] to diagnose [[steatorrhea]].

=== Conklin's staining ===
Special technique designed for staining true endospores with the use of malachite green dye, once stained, they do not decolourize.

===Collagen Hybridizing Peptide Staining===
{{main|Collagen Hybridizing Peptide}}
[[Collagen Hybridizing Peptide]] (CHP) staining allows for an easy, direct way to stain denatured collagens of any type (Type I, II, IV, etc.) regardless if they were damaged or degraded via enzymatic, mechanical, chemical, or thermal means. They work by refolding into the collagen triple helix with the available single strands in the tissue. CHPs can be visualized by a simple [[fluorescence microscope]].

== Common biological stains ==
Different stains react or concentrate in different parts of a cell or tissue, and these properties are used to advantage to reveal specific parts or areas.  Some of the most common biological stains are listed below.  Unless otherwise marked, all of these dyes may be used with fixed cells and tissues; vital dyes (suitable for use with living organisms) are noted.

=== Acridine orange ===
[[Acridine orange]] (AO) is a nucleic acid selective fluorescent cationic dye useful for cell cycle determination. It is cell-permeable, and interacts with DNA and RNA by intercalation or electrostatic attractions. When bound to DNA, it is very similar spectrally to fluorescein. Like fluorescein, it is also useful as a non-specific stain for backlighting conventionally stained cells on the surface of a solid sample of tissue (fluorescence backlighted staining&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = J | year = 1988 | title = A Technique for Staining the Superficial Cells of Plucked Hair Follicles and Other Solid Tissues | url = | journal = Stain Technology | volume = 63 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Bismarck brown ===
[[Bismarck brown Y|Bismarck brown]] (also Bismarck brown Y or Manchester brown) imparts a yellow colour to acid [[mucin]]s.

=== Carmine ===
[[Image:Pseudorhabdosynochus morrhua.jpg|thumb|[[Carmine]] staining of a parasitic flatworm.]]
[[Carmine]] is an intensely red dye used to stain [[glycogen]], while Carmine alum is a nuclear stain.  Carmine stains require the use of a mordant, usually [[aluminum]].

=== Coomassie blue ===
[[Coomassie Brilliant Blue|Coomassie blue]] (also brilliant blue) nonspecifically stains proteins a strong blue colour.  It is often used in gel electrophoresis.

===Cresyl violet===

[[Cresyl violet stain|Cresyl violet]] stains the acidic components of the neuronal cytoplasm a violet colour, specifically [[Nissl body|nissl]] bodies. Often used in brain research.

=== Crystal violet ===
[[Crystal violet]], when combined with a suitable mordant, stains [[cell wall]]s purple.  Crystal violet is the stain used in Gram staining.

=== DAPI ===
[[DAPI]] is a [[fluorescent]] nuclear stain, excited by [[ultraviolet]] light and showing strong blue fluorescence when bound to [[DNA]].  DAPI binds with A=T rich repeats of chromosomes. DAPI is also not visible with regular transmission microscopy. It may be used in living or fixed cells. DAPI-stained cells are especially appropriate for cell counting.&lt;ref&gt;Levenfus, I.: ''An efficient method for counting DAPI-stained cells using Fiji''. Grin: Munich. 2011. {{ISBN|978-3-640-86284-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eosin ===
[[Eosin]] is most often used as a counterstain to haematoxylin, imparting a pink or red colour to [[cytoplasm]]ic material, [[cell membrane]]s, and some extracellular structures.  It also imparts a strong red colour to [[red blood cell]]s.  Eosin may also be used as a counterstain in some variants of Gram staining, and in many other protocols.  There are actually two very closely related compounds commonly referred to as eosin.  Most often used is [[eosin Y]] (also known as eosin Y ws or eosin yellowish); it has a very slightly yellowish cast.  The other eosin compound is eosin B (eosin bluish or imperial red); it has a very faint bluish cast.  The two dyes are interchangeable, and the use of one or the other is more a matter of preference and tradition.

=== Ethidium bromide ===
[[Ethidium bromide]] [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalates]] and stains DNA, providing a fluorescent red-orange stain. Although it will not stain healthy cells, it can be used to identify cells that are in the final stages of [[apoptosis]] – such cells have much more permeable [[biological membrane|membranes]]. Consequently, ethidium bromide is often used as a marker for apoptosis in cells populations and to locate bands of DNA in [[gel electrophoresis]]. The stain may also be used in conjunction with [[acridine orange]] (AO) in viable cell counting. This EB/AO combined stain causes live cells to fluoresce green whilst apoptotic cells retain the distinctive red-orange fluorescence.

=== Acid fuchsine ===
[[Fuchsine|Acid fuchsine]] may be used to stain collagen, smooth muscle, or [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]].
Acid fuchsine is used as the nuclear and cytoplasmic stain in Mallory's trichrome method. Acid fuchsine stains cytoplasm in some variants of Masson's trichrome.  In Van Gieson's picro-fuchsine, acid fuchsine imparts its red colour to collagen fibres. Acid fuchsine is also a traditional stain for mitochondria (Altmann's method).

=== Haematoxylin ===
[[Haematoxylin]] (hematoxylin in North America) is a nuclear stain.&lt;ref name="Bancroft and Stevens, 1982" /&gt;  Used with a mordant, haematoxylin stains nuclei blue-violet or brown.&lt;ref name="Bancroft and Stevens, 1982" /&gt;  It is most often used with eosin in the [[H&amp;E stain]] (haematoxylin and eosin) staining, one of the most common procedures in [[histology]].&lt;ref name="Bancroft and Stevens, 1982" /&gt;

=== Hoechst stains ===
[[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]] is a ''bis''-benzimidazole derivative compound that binds to the ''minor groove'' of [[DNA]]. Often used in fluorescence microscopy for DNA staining, Hoechst stains appear yellow when dissolved in aqueous solutions and emit blue light under UV excitation. There are two major types of [[Hoechst stain|Hoechst]]: ''Hoechst 33258'' and ''Hoechst 33342''. The two compounds are functionally similar, but with a little difference in structure. Hoechst 33258 contains a terminal [[hydroxyl]] group and is thus more soluble in aqueous solution, however this characteristics reduces its ability to penetrate the [[plasma membrane]]. Hoechst 33342 contains an [[ethyl group|ethyl]] substitution on the terminal hydroxyl group (i.e. an ethylether group) making it more hydrophobic for easier plasma membrane passage

=== Iodine ===
[[Iodine]] is used in [[chemistry]] as an indicator for [[starch]]. When starch is mixed with iodine in solution, an intensely dark blue colour develops, representing a starch/iodine complex. Starch is a substance common to most plant cells and so a weak iodine solution will stain starch present in the cells. Iodine is one component in the staining technique known as [[Gram staining]], used in [[microbiology]]. Used as a [[mordant]] in Gram's staining, iodine enhances the entrance of the dye through the pores present in the cell wall/membrane.

[[Lugol's iodine|Lugol's solution]] or Lugol's iodine (IKI) is a brown solution that turns black in the presence of starches and can be used as a cell stain, making the cell [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] more visible. 

Used with common vinegar (acetic acid), Lugol's solution is used to identify [[Cervical_cancer#Diagnosis|pre-cancerous and cancerous changes]] in cervical and vaginal tissues during "Pap smear" follow up examinations in preparation for biopsy. The acetic acid causes the abnormal cells to blanch white, while the normal tissues stain a mahogany brown from the iodine.&lt;ref&gt;Colposcopy and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: a beginners’ manual, Edited by J.W. Sellors and R. Sankaranarayanan http://screening.iarc.fr/colpochap.php?lang=1&amp;chap=4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malachite green ===
[[Malachite green]] (also known as diamond green B or victoria green B) can be used as a blue-green counterstain to safranin in the [[Gimenez stain|Gimenez staining technique]] for bacteria.  It can also be used to directly stain [[endospore|spores]].

=== Methyl green ===
[[Methyl green]] is used commonly with bright-field, as well as fluorescence microscopes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prieto|first1=Daniel|last2=Aparicio|first2=Gonzalo|last3=Morande|first3=Pablo E.|last4=Zolessi|first4=Flavio R.|title=A fast, low cost, and highly efficient fluorescent DNA labeling method using methyl green|journal=Histochemistry and Cell Biology|date=27 March 2014|volume=142|issue=3|pages=335–345|doi=10.1007/s00418-014-1215-0|pmid=24671497}}&lt;/ref&gt; to dye the chromatin of cells so that they are more easily viewed.

=== Methylene blue ===
[[Methylene blue]] is used to stain animal cells, such as human cheek cells, to make their nuclei more observable. Also used to stain  blood films in cytology.

=== Neutral red ===
[[Neutral red]] (or toluylene red) stains [[Nissl body|Nissl substance]] red.  It is usually used as a counterstain in combination with other dyes.

=== Nile blue ===
[[Nile blue]] (or Nile blue A) stains nuclei blue.  It may be used with living cells.

=== Nile red ===
[[Nile red]] (also known as Nile blue oxazone) is formed by boiling Nile blue with [[sulfuric acid]].  This produces a mix of Nile red and Nile blue.  Nile red is a [[lipophilic]] stain; it will accumulate in [[lipid]] globules inside cells, staining them red.  Nile red can be used with living cells. It fluoresces strongly when partitioned into lipids, but practically not at all in aqueous solution.

=== Osmium tetroxide (formal name: osmium tetraoxide) ===
[[Osmium tetraoxide]] is used in optical microscopy to stain [[lipid]]s. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.

=== Propidium Iodide ===
[[Propidium iodide]] is a fluorescent intercalating agent that can be used to stain cells. Propidium iodide is used as a DNA stain in flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability or DNA content in cell cycle analysis, or in microscopy to visualise the nucleus and other DNA-containing organelles. Propidium Iodide cannot cross the membrane of live cells, making it useful to differentiate necrotic, apoptotic and healthy cells. PI also binds to RNA, necessitating treatment with nucleases to distinguish between RNA and DNA staining

=== Rhodamine ===
[[Rhodamine]] is a protein specific fluorescent stain commonly used in fluorescence microscopy.

=== Safranine ===
[[Safranine]] (or Safranine O) is a red cationic dye.  It binds to nuclei (DNA) and other tissue polyanions, including glycosaminoglycans in cartilage and mast cells, and components of lignin and plastids in plant tissues.&lt;ref&gt;Berlyn GP, Miksche JP (1976). ''Botanical Microtechnique and Cytochemistry''. Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Safranine should not be confused with saffron, an expensive natural dye that is used in some methods to impart a yellow colour to collagen, to contrast with blue and red colours imparted by other dyes to nuclei and cytoplasm in animal (including human) tissues.

The incorrect spelling "safranin" is in common use. The -ine ending is appropriate  
for safranine O because this dye is an amine,&lt;ref&gt;Baker JR (1958). ''Principles of Biological Microtechnique''. pp. 329 ff. London: Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11871748|year=2001|author1=Kiernan|first1=J. A.|title=Classification and naming of dyes, stains and fluorochromes|journal=Biotechnic &amp; Histochemistry|volume=76|issue=5–6|pages=261–78|doi=10.1080/bih.76.5-6.261.278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HorobinKiernan"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1859960995|title=Conn's Biological Stains: A Handbook of Dyes, Stains and Fluorochromes for Use in Biology and Medicine |year=2002|editor1=Horobin, Richard|editor2=Kiernan, John |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stainability of tissues==
Tissues which take up stains are called '''chromatic'''.  [[Chromosomes]] were so named because of their ability to absorb a violet stain.

Positive affinity for a specific stain may be designated by the suffix ''-philic''. For example, tissues that stain with an [[azure stain]] may be referred to as [[azurophil]]ic. This may also be used for more generalized staining properties, such as [[Acidophile (histology)|acidophilic]] for tissues that stain by [[acidic]] stains (most notably [[eosin]]), [[basophilic]] when staining in [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] dyes, and ''amphophilic''&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/amphophilic thefreedictionary.com &gt; amphophilic] Citing: ''Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary'', 3 ed. 2007 Elsevier, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; when staining with either acid or basic dyes. In contrast, [[chromophobe|chromophobic]] tissues do not take up coloured dye readily.

== Electron microscopy ==
As in light microscopy, stains can be used to enhance contrast in [[transmission electron microscopy]]. Electron-dense compounds of heavy metals are typically used.

===Phosphotungstic acid===
[[Phosphotungstic acid]] is a common [[negative stain]] for [[virus]]es, [[nerve]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, and other biological tissue materials.

=== Osmium tetroxide ===
[[Osmium tetroxide]] is used in optical microscopy to stain [[lipid]]s. It dissolves in fats, and is reduced by organic materials to elemental osmium, an easily visible black substance.  Because it is a heavy metal that absorbs electrons, it is perhaps the most common stain used for morphology in biological electron microscopy. It is also used for the staining of various polymers for the study of their morphology by TEM. {{chem|OsO|4}} is very volatile and extremely toxic. It is a strong oxidizing agent as the osmium has an oxidation number of +8. It aggressively oxidizes many materials, leaving behind a deposit of non-volatile osmium in a lower oxidation state.

=== Ruthenium tetroxide ===
[[Ruthenium tetroxide]] is equally volatile and even more aggressive than osmium tetraoxide and able to stain even materials that resist the osmium stain, e.g. polyethylene.

Other chemicals used in electron microscopy staining include:
[[ammonium molybdate]], [[cadmium iodide]], [[carbohydrazide]], [[ferric chloride]], [[hexamine]], [[indium trichloride]], [[lanthanum nitrate]], [[lead acetate]], [[lead citrate]], [[lead(II) nitrate]], [[periodic acid]], [[phosphomolybdic acid]], [[potassium ferricyanide]], [[potassium ferrocyanide]], [[ruthenium red]], [[silver nitrate]], [[silver proteinate]], [[sodium chloroaurate]], [[thallium nitrate]], [[thiosemicarbazide]], [[uranyl acetate]], [[uranyl nitrate]], and [[vanadyl sulfate]].

'''CRISPR-Display ('''CRISP-Disp''')''' is a modification of the [[CRISPR|CRISPR/Cas9]] (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) system for genome editing. The CRISPR/Cas9 system uses a short guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence to direct a ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' [[Cas9]] nuclease, acting as a programmable DNA binding protein, to cleave DNA at a site of interest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jinek|first=Martin|last2=Chylinski|first2=Krzysztof|last3=Fonfara|first3=Ines|last4=Hauer|first4=Michael|last5=Doudna|first5=Jennifer A.|last6=Charpentier|first6=Emmanuelle|date=2012-08-17|title=A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity|journal=Science|volume=337|issue=6096|pages=816–821|doi=10.1126/science.1225829|issn=1095-9203|pmid=22745249|pmc=6286148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cong|first=Le|last2=Ran|first2=F.

CRISPR-Display, in contrast, uses a nuclease deficient Cas9 (dCas9) and an engineered sgRNA with aptameric accessory RNA domains, ranging from 100bp to 5kb, outside of the normal complementary targeting sequence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shechner|first=David M.|last2=Hacisuleyman|first2=Ezgi|last3=Younger|first3=Scott T.|last4=Rinn|first4=John L.|date=2015-07-01|title=Multiplexable, locus-specific targeting of long RNAs with CRISPR-Display|journal=Nature Methods|volume=12|issue=7|pages=664–670|doi=10.1038/nmeth.3433|issn=1548-7105|pmc=4821475|pmid=26030444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accessory RNA domains can be functional domains, such as long non-coding RNAs ([[Long non-coding RNA|lncRNAs]]), protein-binding motifs, or epitope tags for immunochemistry. This allows for investigation of the functionality of certain lncRNAs, and targeting of [[ribonucleoprotein]] (RNP) complexes to genomic loci.

CRISPR-Display was first published in Nature Methods in July 2015, and developed by David M. Shechner, Ezgi Hacisuleyman, Scott T. Younger and John Rinn at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), USA.

== Background ==
The CRISPR/Cas9 system is based on an adaptive immune system of prokaryotic organisms, and its use for genome editing was first proposed and developed in collaboration between [[Jennifer Doudna]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]) and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] ([[Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology]], Germany).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The method, and its application in editing human cells, was published in Science on August 17, 2012. In January 2013, the [[Feng Zhang]] lab at the [[Broad Institute]] at MIT published another method in Science, having further optimized the sgRNA structure and expression for use in mammalian cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By the beginning of 2014, almost 2500 studies mentioning CRISPR in their title has been published.

[[Non-coding RNA]]s (ncRNAs) are RNA transcripts that are not translated into a protein product, but instead exert their function as RNA molecules. They are involved in a range of processes, like [[post-transcriptional regulation]] of gene expression, [[genomic imprinting]], and regulating the chromatin state, and thereby the expression, of a given locus. Many ncRNAs have been discovered, but in many cases, their function has yet to be accurately dissected due to technical challenges. ncRNA function is often not affected by introducing point mutations and premature stop codons. ncRNAs are also thought to regulate gene expression, so deletion studies have a hard time distinguishing effects of ncRNA loss from effects of gene misregulation due to the deletion. Studies of ncRNAs have also lacked the throughput necessary for discerning the RNA based functionality. To meet these challenges, the Rinn lab therefore developed a synthetic biology approach, using CRISPR/Cas9 system, with the Cas9 acting as a conduit, to target ncRNA modules to ectopic genomic locations, and investigating the ncRNAs effects on reporter genes and other genomic features at that site.

== Method development ==
CRISPR-Disp modifies the CRISPR/Cas9 technology by using a catalytically inactive, i.e. nuclease deficient, Cas9 mutant (dCas9), and altering the RNA used for targeting Cas9 to a genomic location.

Since sgRNAs are usually expressed by [[RNA polymerase III]], which limits the length of the RNA domain that can be inserted, CRISPR-Display incorporates [[RNA polymerase II]] to permit expression of longer transcripts (~80–250 nucleotides) to overcome this limitation. CRISPR-Display can therefore add larger RNA domains, like natural and lncRNA domains, without affecting dCas9 localization.

The sgRNA is engineered with an aptameric accessory RNA domain in the sequence outside of the targeting sequence. In the development of the technique, five model cofactors with different topology constructs were used: TOP1-4 and INT with an accessory domain (P4-P6 domain) at different positions, including the 5’ and 3’ end and internally within the sgRNA. Each domain contained a stem-loop that can be recognized by a PP7 bacteriophage coat protein. The complex was delivered into mammalian cells (HEK293FT cells) by a [[Viral vector|lentiviral vector]].
[[File:Transcription activator assay.png|thumb|'''Transcription activator assay''' used to verify sgRNA/Cas9 complex targeting activity, and the proper integrity of the added RNA module. Direct activation: The transcription activator, VP64, is fused to the Cas9 protein, so proper targeting of the complex results in reporter gene activation. Bridged activation: VP64 is fused to PP7, which recognizes and binds a sequence in the RNA module when the RNA module is properly folded.]]
To ensure that the attached RNA module both retains targeting functionality as well as the resulting complex drive transcriptional activation at a specific site of interest, transient reporter gene expression of [[luciferase]] and fluorescent protein was measured. Two variations of such a '''transcription activator assay''' was performed; directly with a dCas9 fused to a transcriptional activator/repressor (VP64, a factor known to enhance gene expression) '''(Direct activation)''' or indirectly where the transcriptional activator is fused to an RNA binding protein module on the sgRNA '''(Bridged activation)'''. Reporter gene activation through direct activation imply the sgRNA variant binds and targets dCas9 efficiently. All the five topologies showed direct activation except TOP3 and TOP4, which showed reduced activity. Bridged activation indicates that the fused RNA accessory domain is intact in mature dCas9 complexes. Bridged activation was observed with TOP1, TOP3 and INT. The results were recapitulated at endogenous loci by targeting minimal sgRNA and selective expanded topologies (TOP1 and INT) to human ASCL1, IL1RN, NTF3 and TTN promoters. Direct and bridged activation were observed by qRT-PCR for each construct proving that CRISP-Disp allows deployment of large RNA domains to genomic loci.

The effect of internal (stem-loop) insertion size on dCas9 complex was assessed using INT-like constructs with cassettes of PP7 stem loops with a size range from 25 nt to 247 nt. Each construct induced significant activation in the reporter assays signifying that internal insertion size does not influence the dCas9 complex function. Similarly, the effect of internal insert sequence was also determined through a set of unique sgRNA variants displaying cassettes of 25 random nucleotides. Reporter assays and RIP-Seq confirmed that sequence does not govern complex efficacy.

The utility of CRISP-Disp was explored with an array of functional RNA domains such as natural protein binding motifs, artificial aptamers and small molecules with varying size. While all the complexes were functional and viable, and successfully deployed the RNA domains at endogenous loci, the efficacy changed with length and expression levels. This suggests that optimization of structure and sequence might be important required before designing the construct.

To determine if artificial lncRNA scaffolds can be used with CRISPR-Display, dCas9 complexes were assembled with artificial RNA with a size comparable to lncRNAs. The constructs were expanded to ~650nt size with an additional P4-P6 domain with hairpin loops that can be recognized by another phage coat protein, MS2. These topology constructs were called double TOP0-2 with the two domains either together at 5’ or 3’end or separately at each end. Transient reporter assays followed by confirmation with [[Immunoprecipitation|RNA Immunoprecipitation]] sequencing (RIP-qPCR) showed that all the three constructs retained both the domains in the complex.

This was also tested with natural lncRNA domains by building Pol II-driven TOP1 and INT constructs fused with human lncRNA domains. lncRNAs used had lengths between ~90–4800 nt, and included the NoRC-binding pRNA, three enhancer-transcribed RNAs (eRNAs) FALEC, TRERNA1 and ncRNA-a3), ''Xist'' A-repeat (RepA), and the 4,799-nt transcriptional activator ''[[HOTTIP]]''. While all the constructs showed significant direct activation, it decreased with increasing lncRNA-sgRNA length. These lncRNA domains could regulate the reporters independent of dCas9 with pRNA and RepA repressing the GLuc reporter expression (repressors) and TRERNA1, ncRNA-a3 and HOTTIP inducing activation (activators), but were properly targeted to an ectopic location of interest by using the CRISP-Disp system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Thus, CRISP-Disp enables control of gene expression with deployment of both artificial scaffolds as well as natural lncRNA domains.

== Applications ==
CRISPR-Display allows for previously unavailable studies of lncRNA functionality, artificial ncRNA functionalization, recruitment of endogenous and engineered proteins to genomic loci, and locus affinity tagging for cell imaging. 
[[File:CRISPR-Display_applications.png|thumb|CRISPR-Display allows addition of RNA modules to the sgRNA for a range of functionalities, such as ectopic lncRNA localization, recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation, or affinity tagging for live cell imaging. The functions can be performed simultaneous in the same cell.]]

=== lncRNA domain localization ===
CRISPR-Display allows targeted localization of natural lncRNAs to ectopic sites for investigation of their function. Exposing various ectopic DNA loci to natural lncRNAs can help show the effects of lncRNAs on gene expression and chromatin state, and help dissect the mechanism of such effects. One of the major outstanding questions in the study of lncRNAs is whether effects on chromatin state or gene expression adjacent to a lncRNA locus is due to functional, sequence-specific mechanisms of the lncRNA itself, or due simply to the act of transcribing the lncRNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Pinera|first=Pablo|last2=Jones|first2=Matthew F.|last3=Lal|first3=Ashish|last4=Lu|first4=Timothy K.|date=2015-07-16|title=Putting Non-coding RNA on Display with CRISPR|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=59|issue=2|pages=146–148|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2015.07.002|issn=1097-4164|pmid=26186289|pmc=6314022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melé|first=Marta|last2=Rinn|first2=John L.|date=2016-06-02|title="Cat's Cradling" the 3D Genome by the Act of LncRNA Transcription|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=62|issue=5|pages=657–664|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2016.05.011|issn=1097-4164|pmid=27259198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Localizing lncRNA to ectopic sites with CRISPR-Display can help separate the function of the RNA itself from the effects of transcribing such RNA species. Before CRISPR-Display, such studies were challenging due to low throughput, and inability to distinguish lncRNA function from other confounding factors like cryptically encoded peptides or functional DNA elements.

=== Artificial ncRNA functionalization ===
CRISPR-Display also allows for targeted use of the wide array of artificial RNAs with specific functionality, such as RNAs for recruitment of endogenous RNA-binding proteins, antibody affinity tagging, and recruitment of tagged fusion proteins.

==== Affinity tagging for live cell imaging ====
One example of artificial ncRNA functionalization is incorporating RNA domains recognized by specific antibodies to the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can target the sgRNA with a particular epitope sequence to various loci, and fluorescently tagged antibodies can be used to image the locus, showing its localization in the nucleus, and possible interactions with other tagged proteins or genomic loci.

==== Recruitment of endogenous or engineered RNA binding proteins for gene regulation ====
Endogenous proteins known to bind a specific RNA motif can be recruited to ectopic genomic locations by incorporating the RNA motif into the sgRNA. CRISPR-Display can also recruit fusion proteins engineered to bind specific RNA sequences. Recruiting these proteins can allow studies of specific proteins’ and protein complexes’ effects on gene regulation and chromatin states, as well as specific regulation of certain genes for investigation of gene function.

=== Multiplexed functional studies ===
Due to the modularity of the sgRNA, several different sgRNAs with distinct functional modules can be expressed in each cell at once. The different RNA modules can then work simultaneously and independently, allowing for, for example, regulation of one genomic location whilst imaging the effects of the regulation at another location.

The possible applications of CRISPR-Display will continue to increase with further development and understanding of ncRNA functionalization. It is not unreasonable to think that CRISPR-Display may one day enable complex synthetic biology systems, with distinct temporal expression of sgRNAs, and networks and circuits of gene regulation by targeting of regulatory proteins.

== Advantages ==
* Can easily accommodate large RNA cargo (up to ~4.8kb, possibly even larger) within the sgRNA core. Therefore, structured RNA domains, natural long lncRNAs, artificial RNA modules and pools of random sequences can be used with dCas9.
* sgRNA-dCas9 complexation is not limited by sequence composition of the RNA cargo, but seems independent of the RNA modules used.
* CRISPR-Display is a modular method, which allows different functions to be simultaneously performed at diverse loci in the same cell. Using a single construct with orthogonal RNA binding proteins where each protein is fused to a unique functional domain and targeted by sgRNA containing its related RNA motif. (multiplexing) (already included in the applications)
* RNA modules can be added at different locations within the sgRNA sequence (internally, or at the 5’ or 3’ ends), so the location of the RNA module can be optimized or best function.
* Allows construction of Cas9 complexes with protein binding cassettes, artificial aptamers, pools of random sequences as well as natural lncRNAs.

== Limitations ==
* CRISPR-Display is currently limited by the number of available functional RNA motifs and RNA binding protein functions. As more such motifs and proteins are discovered and developed, further applications of CRISPR-Display may become possible.
* dCas9 complexation decreases with increasing sgRNA-lncRNA length. The quantitative yields of intact lncRNA domains are, however, recovered relative to the respective sgRNA. Therefore, construct integrity can depend on factors like length and RNA structure.
* Design of a high efficiency CRISPR-Display construct may require some structural or sequence optimization, which can lead to variable construct efficacy.

[[File:Deformity of Hand due to X-ray burns.jpg|thumb|Female hand showing deformity due to x-ray burns. The inflammation is due to excessive radiation, which occurs when x-ray machines are unshielded.]]

A '''deformity''', '''dysmorphism''', or '''dysmorphic feature''' is a major abnormality in the shape of a body part or organ compared to the normal shape of that part.
==Causes==
Deformity may arise from numerous causes:
*Genetic [[mutation]]
*Damage to the [[fetus]] or [[uterus]]
*Complications at [[childbirth|birth]]
*A growth or hormone disorder
*Reconstructive surgery following a severe injury, e.g. [[Third degree burn|burn injury]]
*[[Arthritis]] and other rheumatoid disorders
*Fractured bones left to heal without being properly [[Reduction (orthopedic_surgery)|set]] ([[malunion]])
*Chronic application of external forces, e.g. [[artificial cranial deformation]]
*Chronic [[paresis]], [[paralysis]] or [[muscle imbalance]], especially in children, e.g. due to [[poliomyelitis]] or [[cerebral palsy]]

Deformity can occur in non-humans, as well.  [[Frogs]] can be mutated due to [[Ribeiroia]] ([[Trematoda]]) infection.

==Mortality==
In many cases in which a major deformity is present at birth, it is the result of an underlying condition severe enough that the baby does not survive very long. The mortality of severely deformed births may be due to a range of complications including missing or non-functioning vital organs, structural defects that prevent breathing or eating, and high susceptibility to injuries, abnormal facial appearance, or infections that lead to death.

==In mythology==
[[Mythological]] creatures may have been created due to a deformative syndrome also, for instance, descriptions of [[mermaid]]s may be related to the symptoms of [[sirenomelia]]. The [[Irish Mythology]] includes the [[Fomorians]], who are almost without exception described as being deformed, possessing only one of what most have two of ([[human eye|eye]]s, [[arm]]s, [[Human leg|leg]]s, etc.) or having larger than normal limbs.

      <text bytes="34227" xml:space="preserve">'''Third-generation sequencing''' (also known as '''long-read sequencing''') is a class of [[DNA sequencing]] methods currently under active development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Third generation sequencing works by reading the nucleotide sequences at the single molecule level, in contrast to existing methods that require breaking long strands of DNA into small segments then inferring nucleotide sequences by amplification and synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.illumina.com/documents/products/techspotlights/techspotlight_sequencing.pdf|title=Illumina sequencing technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical challenges exist in the engineering of the necessary molecular instruments for whole genome sequencing to make the technology commercially available.

[[Massive parallel sequencing|Second-generation sequencing]] (short-read sequencing), often referred to as Next-generation sequencing (NGS), has dominated the DNA sequencing space since its development. It has dramatically reduced the cost of DNA sequencing by enabling a massively-paralleled approach capable of producing large numbers of reads at exceptionally high coverages throughout the genome.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treangen|first=Todd J.|last2=Salzberg|first2=Steven L.|date=2012-01-01|title=Repetitive DNA and next-generation sequencing: computational challenges and solutions|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=36–46|doi=10.1038/nrg3117|issn=1471-0056|pmc=3324860|pmid=22124482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since eukaryotic genomes contain many repetitive regions, a major limitation to this class of sequencing methods is the length of reads it produces.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Briefly, second generation sequencing works by first amplifying the DNA molecule and then conducting sequencing by synthesis. The collective fluorescent signal resulting from synthesizing a large number of amplified identical DNA strands allows the inference of nucleotide identity. However, due to random errors, DNA synthesis between the amplified DNA strands would become progressively out-of-sync. Quickly, the signal quality deteriorates as the read-length grows. In order to preserve read quality, long DNA molecules must be broken up into small segments, resulting in a critical limitation of second generation sequencing technologies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Computational efforts aimed to overcome this challenge often rely on approximative [[heuristic]]s that may not result in accurate assemblies.

By enabling direct sequencing of single DNA molecules, third generation sequencing technologies have the capability to produce substantially longer reads than second generation sequencing.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bleidorn|first=Christoph|date=2016-01-02|title=Third generation sequencing: technology and its potential impact on evolutionary biodiversity research|journal=Systematics and Biodiversity|volume=14|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1080/14772000.2015.1099575|issn=1477-2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an advantage has critical implications for both genome science and the study of biology in general. However, third generation sequencing data have much higher error rates than previous technologies, which can complicate downstream genome assembly and analysis of the resulting data.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Pushpendra K.|date=2008-11-01|title=Single-molecule DNA sequencing technologies for future genomics research|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|volume=26|issue=11|pages=602–611|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2008.07.003|pmid=18722683}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technologies are undergoing active development and it is expected that there will be improvements to the high error rates. For applications that are more tolerant to error rates, such as structural variant calling, third generation sequencing has been found to outperform existing methods{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=May 2019}}.

== Current technologies ==
Sequencing technologies with a different approach than second-generation platforms were first described as "third-generation" in 2008-2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Check Hayden|first=Erika|date=2009-02-06|title=Genome sequencing: the third generation|journal=Nature News|volume=457|issue=7231|pages=768–769|language=en|doi=10.1038/news.2009.86|pmid=19212365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several companies currently at the heart of third generation sequencing technology development, namely, [[Pacific Biosciences]], [[Oxford Nanopore Technologies|Oxford Nanopore Technology]], Quantapore (CA-USA), and Stratos (WA-USA). These companies are taking fundamentally different approaches to sequencing single DNA molecules.

PacBio developed the sequencing platform of [[SMRT sequencing|single molecule real time sequencing (SMRT)]], based on the properties of [[zero-mode waveguide]]s. Signals are in the form of fluorescent light emission from each nucleotide incorporated by a DNA polymerase bound to the bottom of the zL well.

[[Nanopore sequencing|Oxford Nanopore’s technology]] involves passing a DNA molecule through a nanoscale pore structure and then measuring changes in electrical field surrounding the pore; while Quantapore has a different proprietary nanopore approach. Stratos Genomics spaces out the DNA bases with polymeric inserts, "''Xpandomers''", to circumvent the signal to noise challenge of nanopore ssDNA reading.

Also notable is [[Helicos_single_molecule_fluorescent_sequencing|Helicos]]'s single molecule fluorescence approach, but the company entered bankruptcy in the [[Helicos_Biosciences|fall of 2015]].

== Advantages ==

=== Longer reads ===
In comparison to the current generation of sequencing technologies, third generation sequencing has the obvious advantage of producing much longer reads. It is expected that these longer read lengths will alleviate numerous computational challenges surrounding genome assembly, transcript reconstruction, and metagenomics among other important areas of modern biology and medicine.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

It is well known that eukaryotic genomes including primates and humans are complex and have large numbers of long repeated regions. Short reads from second generation sequencing must resort to approximative strategies in order to infer sequences over long ranges for assembly and genetic variant calling. [[Paired-end tag|Pair end reads]] have been leveraged by second generation sequencing to combat these limitations. However, exact fragment lengths of pair ends are often unknown and must also be approximated as well. By making long reads lengths possible, third generation sequencing technologies have clear advantages.

=== Epigenetics ===
[[Epigenetics|Epigenetic markers]] are stable and potentially heritable modifications to the DNA molecule that are not in its sequence. An example is DNA methylation at CpG sites, which has been found to influence gene expression. Histone modifications are another example. The current generation of sequencing technologies rely on laboratory techniques such as [[ChIP-sequencing]] for the detection of epigenetic markers. These techniques involve tagging the DNA strand, breaking and filtering fragments that contain markers, followed by sequencing. Third generation sequencing may enable direct detection of these markers due to their distinctive signal from the other four nucleotide bases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Portability and speed ===
Other important advantages of third generation sequencing technologies include portability and sequencing speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schadt|first=E. E.|last2=Turner|first2=S.|last3=Kasarskis|first3=A.|date=2010-10-15|title=A window into third-generation sequencing|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|language=en|volume=19|issue=R2|pages=R227–R240|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddq416|pmid=20858600|issn=0964-6906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since minimal sample preprocessing is required in comparison to second generation sequencing, smaller equipments could be designed. Oxford Nanopore Technology has recently commercialized the [https://nanoporetech.com/products/minion MinION sequencer]. This sequencing machine is roughly the size of a regular USB flash drive and can be used readily by connecting to a laptop. In addition, since the sequencing process is not parallelized across regions of the genome, data could be collected and analyzed in real time. These advantages of third generation sequencing may be well-suited in hospital settings where quick and on-site data collection and analysis is demanded.

== Challenges ==
{{Update|section=yes|date=January 2020|part=long-read sequencing technologies producing low-accuracy reads. While true 5 years ago, circular consensus reads with the PacBio Sequel II long-read sequencer can easily achieve an even higher read accuracy than [[hybrid genome assembly]] with a combination of other sequencers.  [https://www.pacb.com/smrt-science/smrt-sequencing/smrt-sequencing-modes/] {{PMID|31885515|28364362|31406327|31897449|31483244}}}}

Third generation sequencing, as it currently stands, faces important challenges mainly surrounding accurate identification of nucleotide bases; error rates are still much higher compared to second generation sequencing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This is generally due to instability of the molecular machinery involved. For example, in PacBio’s single molecular and real time sequencing technology, the DNA polymerase molecule becomes increasingly damaged as the sequencing process occurs.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, since the process happens quickly, the signals given off by individual bases may be blurred by signals from neighbouring bases. This poses a new computational challenge for deciphering the signals and consequently inferring the sequence. Methods such as [[Hidden Markov model|Hidden Markov Models]], for example, have been leveraged for this purpose with some success.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On average, different individuals of the human population share about 99.9% of their genes. In other words, approximately only one out of every thousand bases would differ between any two person. The high error rates involved with third generation sequencing are inevitably problematic for the purpose of characterizing individual differences that exist between members of the same species.

== Genome assembly ==
[[Sequence assembly|Genome assembly]] is the reconstruction of whole genome DNA sequences. This is generally done with two fundamentally different approaches.

=== Reference alignment ===
When a reference genome is available, as one is in the case of human, newly sequenced reads could simply be aligned to the reference genome in order to characterize its properties. Such reference based assembly is quick and easy but has the disadvantage of “hiding" novel sequences and large copy number variants. In addition, reference genomes do not yet exist for most organisms.

=== ''De novo'' assembly ===
''De novo'' assembly is the alternative genome assembly approach to reference alignment. It refers to the reconstruction of whole genome sequences entirely from raw sequence reads. This method would be chosen when there is no reference genome, when the species of the given organism is unknown as in [[metagenomics]], or when there exist genetic variants of interest that may not be detected by reference genome alignment.

Given the short reads produced by the current generation of sequencing technologies, de novo assembly is a major computational problem. It is normally approached by an iterative process of finding and connecting sequence reads with sensible overlaps. Various computational and statistical techniques, such as [[De Bruijn graph|de bruijn graphs]] and overlap layout consensus graphs, have been leveraged to solve this problem. Nonetheless, due to the highly repetitive nature of eukaryotic genomes, accurate and complete reconstruction of genome sequences in de novo assembly remains challenging. [[Paired-end tag|Pair end reads]] have been posed as a possible solution, though exact fragment lengths are often unknown and must be approximated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Ruiqiang|last2=Zhu|first2=Hongmei|last3=Ruan|first3=Jue|last4=Qian|first4=Wubin|last5=Fang|first5=Xiaodong|last6=Shi|first6=Zhongbin|last7=Li|first7=Yingrui|last8=Li|first8=Shengting|last9=Shan|first9=Gao|date=2010-02-01|title=De novo assembly of human genomes with massively parallel short read sequencing|journal=Genome Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=265–272|doi=10.1101/gr.097261.109|issn=1088-9051|pmc=2813482|pmid=20019144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybrid assembly ===
Long read lengths offered by third generation sequencing may alleviate many of the challenges currently faced by de novo genome assemblies. For example, if an entire repetitive region can be sequenced unambiguously in a single read, no computation inference would be required. Computational methods have been proposed to alleviate the issue of high error rates. For example, in one study, it was demonstrated that de novo assembly of a microbial genome using PacBio sequencing alone performed superior to that of second generation sequencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chin|first=Chen-Shan|last2=Alexander|first2=David H.|last3=Marks|first3=Patrick|last4=Klammer|first4=Aaron A.|last5=Drake|first5=James|last6=Heiner|first6=Cheryl|last7=Clum|first7=Alicia|last8=Copeland|first8=Alex|last9=Huddleston|first9=John|date=2013-06-01|title=Nonhybrid, finished microbial genome assemblies from long-read SMRT sequencing data|journal=Nature Methods|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=563–569|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2474|pmid=23644548|issn=1548-7091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third generation sequencing may also be used in conjunction with second generation sequencing. This approach is often referred to as hybrid sequencing. For example, long reads from third generation sequencing may be used to resolve ambiguities that exist in genomes previously assembled using second generation sequencing. On the other hand, short second generation reads have been used to correct errors in that exist in the long third generation reads. In general, this hybrid approach has been shown to improve de novo genome assemblies significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goodwin|first=Sara|last2=Gurtowski|first2=James|last3=Ethe-Sayers|first3=Scott|last4=Deshpande|first4=Panchajanya|last5=Schatz|first5=Michael C.|last6=McCombie|first6=W.

== Epigenetic markers ==
[[DNA methylation|DNA methylation (DNAm)]] – the covalent modification of [[DNA]] at CpG sites resulting in attached [[methyl group]]s – is the best understood component of [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] machinery. DNA modifications and resulting gene expression can vary across cell types, temporal development, with genetic ancestry, can change due to environmental stimuli and are heritable. After the discovery of DNAm, researchers have also found its correlation to diseases like cancer and [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Hunter B.|last2=Lam|first2=Lucia L.|last3=Neumann|first3=Sarah M.|last4=Kobor|first4=Michael S.|date=2012-02-09|title=Population-specificity of human DNA methylation|journal=Genome Biology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=R8|doi=10.1186/gb-2012-13-2-r8|issn=1474-760X|pmc=3334571|pmid=22322129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this disease etiology context DNAm is an important avenue of further research.

=== Advantages ===
The current most common methods for examining methylation state [[DNA methylation#Detection|require an assay]] that fragments DNA before standard second generation sequencing on the [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] platform. As a result of short read length, information regarding the longer patterns of methylation are lost.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite biorxiv|last=Simpson|first=Jared T.|last2=Workman|first2=Rachael|last3=Zuzarte|first3=Philip C.|last4=David|first4=Matei|last5=Dursi|first5=Lewis Jonathan|last6=Timp|first6=Winston|date=2016-04-04|title=Detecting DNA Methylation using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencer|biorxiv=047142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third generation sequencing technologies offer the capability for single molecule real-time sequencing of longer reads, and detection of DNA modification without the aforementioned assay.&lt;ref name="Flusberg 461–465"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flusberg|first=Benjamin A.|last2=Webster|first2=Dale R.|last3=Lee|first3=Jessica H.|last4=Travers|first4=Kevin J.|last5=Olivares|first5=Eric C.|last6=Clark|first6=Tyson A.|last7=Korlach|first7=Jonas|last8=Turner|first8=Stephen W.|date=2010-06-01|title=Direct detection of DNA methylation during single-molecule, real-time sequencing|journal=Nature Methods|language=en|volume=7|issue=6|pages=461–465|doi=10.1038/nmeth.1459|pmc=2879396|pmid=20453866}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:3rd_gen_Epigenetics.png|thumb|577x577px|PacBio SMRT technology and Oxford Nanopore can use unaltered DNA to detect methylation.]]
[[Oxford Nanopore Technologies|Oxford Nanopore Technologies’]] [[MinION]] has been used to detect DNAm. As each DNA strand passes through a pore, it produces electrical signals which have been found to be sensitive to epigenetic changes in the nucleotides, and a [[hidden Markov model]] (HMM) was used to analyze MinION data to detect [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]] (5mC) DNA modification.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The model was trained using synthetically methylated [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] DNA and the resulting signals measured by the nanopore technology. Then the trained model was used to detect 5mC in MinION genomic reads from a human cell line which already had a reference methylome. The classifier has 82% accuracy in randomly sampled singleton sites, which increases to 95% when more stringent thresholds are applied.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other methods address different types of DNA modifications using the MinION platform. Stoiber et al. examined 4-methylcytosine (4mC) and 6-methyladenine (6mA), along with 5mC, and also created a software to directly visualize the raw MinION data in human-friendly way.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite biorxiv|last=Stoiber|first=Marcus H.|last2=Quick|first2=Joshua|last3=Egan|first3=Rob|last4=Lee|first4=Ji Eun|last5=Celniker|first5=Susan E.|last6=Neely|first6=Robert|last7=Loman|first7=Nicholas|last8=Pennacchio|first8=Len|last9=Brown|first9=James B.|date=2016-12-15|title=De novo Identification of DNA Modifications Enabled by Genome-Guided Nanopore Signal Processing|biorxiv=094672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here they found that in ''E. coli'', which has a known [[methylome]], event windows of 5 base pairs long can be used to divide and statistically analyze the raw MinION electrical signals. A straightforward [[Mann–Whitney U test|Mann-Whitney U test]] can detect modified portions of the ''E. coli'' sequence, as well as further split the modifications into 4mC, 6mA or 5mC regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It seems likely that in the future, MinION raw data will be used to detect many different epigenetic marks in DNA.

[[Pacific Biosciences|PacBio]] sequencing has also been used to detect DNA methylation. In this platform the pulse width - the width of a fluorescent light pulse - corresponds to a specific base. In 2010 it was shown that the interpulse distance in control and methylated samples are different, and there is a "signature" pulse width for each methylation type.&lt;ref name="Flusberg 461–465"/&gt; In 2012 using the PacBio platform the binding sites of DNA [[methyltransferase]]s were characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=T.

Other forms of DNA modifications – from heavy metals, oxidation, or UV damage – are also possible avenues of research using Oxford Nanopore and PacBio third generation sequencing.

=== Drawbacks ===
Processing of the raw data – such as normalization to the median signal – was needed on MinION raw data, reducing real-time capability of the technology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Consistency of the electrical signals is still an issue, making it difficult to accurately call a nucleotide. MinION has low throughput; since multiple overlapping reads are hard to obtain, this further leads to accuracy problems of downstream DNA modification detection. Both the hidden Markov model and statistical methods used with MinION raw data require repeated observations of DNA modifications for detection, meaning that individual modified nucleotides need to be consistently present in multiple copies of the genome, e.g. in multiple cells or plasmids in the sample.

For the PacBio platform, too, depending on what methylation you expect to find, coverage needs can vary. As of March 2017, other epigenetic factors like histone modifications have not been discoverable using third-generation technologies. Longer patterns of methylation are often lost because smaller contigs still need to be assembled.

== Transcriptomics ==
[[Transcriptomics]] is the study of the [[transcriptome]], usually by characterizing the relative abundances of messenger RNA molecules the tissue under study. According to the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], genetic information flows from double stranded DNA molecules to single stranded mRNA molecules where they can be readily translated into function protein molecules. By studying the transcriptome, one can gain valuable insight into the regulation of gene expressions.

While expression levels as the gene level can be more or less accurately depicted by second generation sequencing, transcript level information is still an important challenge.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steijger|first=Tamara|last2=Abril|first2=Josep F.|last3=Engström|first3=Pär G.|last4=Kokocinski|first4=Felix|last5=The RGASP Consortium|last6=Hubbard|first6=Tim J.|last7=Guigó|first7=Roderic|last8=Harrow|first8=Jennifer|last9=Bertone|first9=Paul|date=2013-12-01|title=Assessment of transcript reconstruction methods for RNA-seq|journal=Nature Methods|language=en|volume=10|issue=12|pages=1177–1184|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2714|issn=1548-7091|pmc=3851240|pmid=24185837}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the role of alternative splicing in molecular biology remains largely elusive. Third generation sequencing technologies hold promising prospects in resolving this issue by enabling sequencing of mRNA molecules at their full lengths.

=== Alternative splicing ===
[[Alternative splicing]] (AS) is the process by which a single gene may give rise to multiple distinct mRNA transcripts and consequently different protein translations.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graveley|first=Brenton R.|title=Alternative splicing: increasing diversity in the proteomic world|journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=17|issue=2|pages=100–107|doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(00)02176-4|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence suggests that AS is a ubiquitous phenomenon and may play a key role in determining the phenotypes of organisms, especially in complex eukaryotes; all eukaryotes contain genes consisting of introns that may undergo AS. In particular, it has been estimated that AS occurs in 95% of all human multi-exon genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Qun|last2=Shai|first2=Ofer|last3=Lee|first3=Leo J.|last4=Frey|first4=Brendan J.|last5=Blencowe|first5=Benjamin J.|date=2008-12-01|title=Deep surveying of alternative splicing complexity in the human transcriptome by high-throughput sequencing|journal=Nature Genetics|language=en|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1413–1415|doi=10.1038/ng.259|pmid=18978789|issn=1061-4036}}&lt;/ref&gt; AS has undeniable potential to influence myriad biological processes. Advancing knowledge in this area has critical implications for the study of biology in general.

=== Transcript reconstruction ===
The current generation of sequencing technologies produce only short reads, putting tremendous limitation on the ability to detect distinct transcripts; short reads must be reverse engineered into original transcripts that could have given rise to the resulting read observations.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pertea|first=Mihaela|last2=Pertea|first2=Geo M.|last3=Antonescu|first3=Corina M.|last4=Chang|first4=Tsung-Cheng|last5=Mendell|first5=Joshua T.|last6=Salzberg|first6=Steven L.|date=2015-03-01|title=StringTie enables improved reconstruction of a transcriptome from RNA-seq reads|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=290–295|doi=10.1038/nbt.3122|issn=1087-0156|pmc=4643835|pmid=25690850}}&lt;/ref&gt; This task is further complicated by the highly variable expression levels across transcripts, and consequently variable read coverages across the sequence of the gene.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In addition, exons may be shared among individual transcripts, rendering unambiguous inferences essentially impossible.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Existing computational methods make inferences based on the accumulation of short reads at various sequence locations often by making simplifying assumptions.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; [https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/ Cufflinks] takes a parsimonious approach, seeking to explain all the reads with the fewest possible number of transcripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trapnell|first=Cole|last2=Williams|first2=Brian A.|last3=Pertea|first3=Geo|last4=Mortazavi|first4=Ali|last5=Kwan|first5=Gordon|last6=van Baren|first6=Marijke J.|last7=Salzberg|first7=Steven L.|last8=Wold|first8=Barbara J.|last9=Pachter|first9=Lior|date=2010-05-01|title=Transcript assembly and quantification by RNA-Seq reveals unannotated transcripts and isoform switching during cell differentiation|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=28|issue=5|pages=511–515|doi=10.1038/nbt.1621|issn=1087-0156|pmc=3146043|pmid=20436464}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, StringTie attempts to simultaneously estimate transcript abundances while assembling the reads.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; These methods, while reasonable, may not always identify real transcripts.

A study published in 2008 surveyed 25 different existing transcript reconstruction protocols.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Its evidence suggested that existing methods are generally weak in assembling transcripts, though the ability to detect individual exons are relatively intact.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; According to the estimates, average sensitivity to detect exons across the 25 protocols is 80% for ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' genes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In comparison, transcript identification sensitivity decreases to 65%. For human, the study reported an exon detection sensitivity averaging to 69% and transcript detection sensitivity had an average of mere 33%.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In other words, for human, existing methods are able to identify less than half of all existing transcript.

Third generation sequencing technologies have demonstrated promising prospects in solving the problem of transcript detection as well as mRNA abundance estimation at the level of transcripts. While error rates remain high, third generation sequencing technologies have the capability to produce much longer read lengths.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abdel-Ghany|first=Salah E.|last2=Hamilton|first2=Michael|last3=Jacobi|first3=Jennifer L.|last4=Ngam|first4=Peter|last5=Devitt|first5=Nicholas|last6=Schilkey|first6=Faye|last7=Ben-Hur|first7=Asa|last8=Reddy|first8=Anireddy S.

The trouble with higher error rates may be alleviated by supplementary high quality short reads. This approach has been previously tested and reported to reduce the error rate by more than 3 folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Au|first=Kin Fai|last2=Underwood|first2=Jason G.|last3=Lee|first3=Lawrence|last4=Wong|first4=Wing Hung|date=2012-10-04|title=Improving PacBio Long Read Accuracy by Short Read Alignment|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=10|pages=e46679|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0046679|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3464235|pmid=23056399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metagenomics ==

[[Metagenomics]] is the analysis of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples.

=== Advantages ===
The main advantage for third-generation sequencing technologies in [[metagenomics]] is their speed of sequencing in comparison to second generation techniques. Speed of sequencing is important for example in the clinical setting (i.e. [[pathogen]] identification), to allow for efficient diagnosis and timely clinical actions.

Oxford Nanopore's MinION was used in 2015 for real-time metagenomic detection of pathogens in complex, high-background clinical samples. The first [[Ebola virus]] (EBV) read was sequenced 44 seconds after data acquisition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greninger|first=Alexander L.|last2=Naccache|first2=Samia N.|last3=Federman|first3=Scot|last4=Yu|first4=Guixia|last5=Mbala|first5=Placide|last6=Bres|first6=Vanessa|last7=Stryke|first7=Doug|last8=Bouquet|first8=Jerome|last9=Somasekar|first9=Sneha|date=2015-01-01|title=Rapid metagenomic identification of viral pathogens in clinical samples by real-time nanopore sequencing analysis|journal=Genome Medicine|volume=7|pages=99|doi=10.1186/s13073-015-0220-9|issn=1756-994X|pmc=4587849|pmid=26416663}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was uniform mapping of reads to genome; at least one read mapped to &gt;88% of the genome. The relatively long reads allowed for sequencing of a near-complete viral genome to high accuracy (97–99% identity) directly from a primary clinical sample.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A common [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] marker for microbial community diversity studies is the 16S [[ribosomal RNA]] gene. Both MinION and PacBio's SMRT platform have been used to sequence this gene.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schloss|first=Patrick D.|last2=Jenior|first2=Matthew L.|last3=Koumpouras|first3=Charles C.|last4=Westcott|first4=Sarah L.|last5=Highlander|first5=Sarah K.|date=2016-01-01|title=Sequencing 16S rRNA gene fragments using the PacBio SMRT DNA sequencing system|journal=PeerJ|volume=4|pages=e1869|doi=10.7717/peerj.1869|pmc=4824876|pmid=27069806}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benítez-Páez|first=Alfonso|last2=Portune|first2=Kevin J.|last3=Sanz|first3=Yolanda|date=2016-01-01|title=Species-level resolution of 16S rRNA gene amplicons sequenced through the MinION™ portable nanopore sequencer|journal=GigaScience|volume=5|pages=4|doi=10.1186/s13742-016-0111-z|issn=2047-217X|pmc=4730766|pmid=26823973}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context the PacBio error rate was comparable to that of shorter reads from [[454 Life Sciences|454]] and Illumina's MiSeq sequencing platforms.

=== Drawbacks ===
MinION's high error rate (~10-40%) prevented identification of [[antimicrobial resistance]] markers, for which single nucleotide resolution is necessary. For the same reason [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] pathogens were not identified.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ease of carryover contamination when re-using same the flow cell (standard wash protocols don’t work) is also a concern. Unique barcodes may allow for more multiplexing. Furthermore, performing accurate species identification for [[bacteria]], [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[Parasitism|parasites]] is very difficult, as they share a larger portion of the genome, and some only differ by &lt;5%.

The per base sequencing cost is still significantly more than that of MiSeq. However, the prospect of supplementing reference databases with full-length sequences from organisms below the limit of detection from the [[Sanger sequencing|Sanger]] approach;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; this could possibly greatly help the identification of organisms in metagenomics.

TVP23A is a member of the pfam superfamily containing the [[domain of unknown function]] 846 (DUF846).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cddsrv.cgi?uid=191380 |title=DUF846}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TVP23A has a predicted molecular weight of 24.1 kilodaltons, an isoelectric point of 6.5, and relatively high amounts of [[tryptophan]] and [[phenylalanine]].&lt;ref name="Biology Workbench"&gt;{{cite web|title=SAPS|url=http://seqtool.sdsc.edu/CGI/BW.cgi#!|website=Biology Workbench|publisher=SDSC}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The secondary structure of TVP23A consists primarily of [[alpha helices]] composing 4 transmembrane domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TMHMM|url=http://seqtool.sdsc.edu/CGI/BW.cgi#!|website=Biology Workbench}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not much information on the tertiary structure of TVP23A or its homologs.  iTASSER&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I-TASSER server for protein structure and function prediction|url=http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/|website=zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used to generate a prediction for the folding pattern of TVP23A, which supports the presence of multiple helix structures.

== Expression ==
TVP23A is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gene: TVP23A|url=http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/ExpressionAtlas?g=ENSG00000166676;r=16:10760919-10818794|website=www.ensembl.org|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of higher expression in the brain tissue of mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GDS3142 / 1435130_at|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/tools/profileGraph.cgi?ID=GDS3142:1435130_at|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promoter for TVP23A is GXP_91266, spanning 1403 base pairs located on the negative strand of chromosome 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ElDorado|url=https://www.genomatix.de/|website=Genomatix.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
The hypothesized function of TVP23A is a transmembrane protein involved in retrograde transport of [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]] from early [[endosome]]s into the late Golgi apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inadome|first1=Hironori|last2=Noda|first2=Yoichi|last3=Kamimura|first3=Yurika|last4=Adachi|first4=Hiroyuki|last5=Yoda|first5=Koji|title=Tvp38, Tvp23, Tvp18 and Tvp15: Novel membrane proteins in the Tlg2-containing Golgi/endosome compartments of Saccharomyces cerevisiae|journal=Experimental Cell Research|date=February 2007|volume=313|issue=4|pages=688–697|doi=10.1016/j.yexcr.2006.11.008|pmid=17178117}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVP23A interactions with [[SNARE (protein)|SNARE]] TVI1 were found to be required for retrograde transport.

== Interacting Proteins ==
TVP23A has been found to interact with four different proteins via Yeast [[Two-hybrid screening|two hybrid arrays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IntAct|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/|website=www.ebi.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of these proteins, YIPF1 and YIPF2, are believed to be Golgi transport proteins.

== Homology ==

=== Homologous Domains ===
TVP23A is a DUF846 containing protein, which is homologous throughout TVP-type proteins.  This domain contains the 4 transmembrane domains of TVP23A&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF05832|title=Pfam: Family: DUF846 (PF05832)|website=pfam.xfam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paralogs ===
TVP23A has two paralogs, [[FAM18B1|TVP23B]] and TVP23C.  TVP23B and TVP23C are 96% similar to each other, and both are located on [[Chromosome 17 (human)|chromosome 17]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool|url=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi|website=blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the locations of these three genes, and their identities to each other, it is probable that ancestral TVP23 underwent [[Gene duplication|duplication]] and [[Translocation (genetics)|translocation]], giving rise to TVP23A on chromosome 16 and TVP23B/C on chromosome 17, which then underwent a second duplication to form TVP23B and TVP23C.

'''[[Machine learning]]''', a subfield of [[computer science]] involving the development of algorithms that learn how to make predictions based on [[Database|data]], has a number of emerging applications in the field of [[bioinformatics]]. Bioinformatics deals with computational and mathematical approaches for understanding and processing biological data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Prior to the emergence of machine learning algorithms, bioinformatics algorithms had to be explicitly programmed by hand which, for problems such as [[protein structure prediction]], proves extremely difficult.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Yuedong|last2=Gao|first2=Jianzhao|last3=Wang|first3=Jihua|last4=Heffernan|first4=Rhys|last5=Hanson|first5=Jack|last6=Paliwal|first6=Kuldip|last7=Zhou|first7=Yaoqi|title=Sixty-five years of the long march in protein secondary structure prediction: the final stretch?|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=19|issue=3|pages=482–494|doi=10.1093/bib/bbw129|pmid=28040746|pmc=5952956|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine learning techniques such as [[deep learning]] enable the algorithm to make use of automatic [[feature learning]] which means that based on the dataset alone, the algorithm can learn how to combine multiple [[Feature (machine learning)|features]] of the input data into a more abstract set of features from which to conduct further learning. This multi-layered approach to learning patterns in the input data allows such systems to make quite complex predictions when trained on large datasets. In recent years, the size and number of available biological datasets have skyrocketed, enabling bioinformatics researchers to make use of these machine learning systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Machine learning has been applied to six biological domains: [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[microarrays]], [[systems biology]], [[evolution]], and [[text mining]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larrañaga|first=Pedro|last2=Calvo|first2=Borja|last3=Santana|first3=Roberto|last4=Bielza|first4=Concha|last5=Galdiano|first5=Josu|last6=Inza|first6=Iñaki|last7=Lozano|first7=José A.|last8=Armañanzas|first8=Rubén|last9=Santafé|first9=Guzmán|title=Machine learning in bioinformatics|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=7|issue=1|pages=86–112|doi=10.1093/bib/bbk007|pmid=16761367|date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Genomics ===
[[File:Growth of GenBank.png|thumb|The exponential growth of GenBank, a genomic sequence database provided by the National center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)]]
[[Genomics]] involves the study of the [[genome]], the complete [[DNA sequencing|DNA sequence]], of organisms. While genomic sequence data has historically been sparse due to the technical difficulty in sequencing a piece of DNA, the number of available sequences is growing exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/statistics/|title=GenBank and WGS Statistics|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while [[raw data]] is becoming increasingly available and accessible, the biological interpretation of this data is occurring at a much slower pace.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathé|first=Catherine|last2=Sagot|first2=Marie-France|last3=Schiex|first3=Thomas|last4=Rouzé|first4=Pierre|date=October 1, 2002|title=Current methods of gene prediction, their strengths and weaknesses|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=30|issue=19|pages=4103–4117|issn=1362-4962|pmc=140543|pmid=12364589|doi=10.1093/nar/gkf543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there is an increasing need for the development of machine learning systems that can automatically determine the location of protein-encoding genes within a given DNA sequence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is a problem in computational biology known as [[gene prediction]].

Gene prediction is commonly performed through a combination of what are known as extrinsic and intrinsic searches.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For the extrinsic search, the input DNA sequence is run through a large database of sequences whose genes have been previously discovered and their locations annotated. A number of the sequence's genes can be identified by determining which strings of bases within the sequence are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to known gene sequences. However, given the limitation in size of the database of known and annotated gene sequences, not all the genes in a given input sequence can be identified through homology alone. Therefore, an intrinsic search is needed where a gene prediction program attempts to identify the remaining genes from the DNA sequence alone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Machine learning has also been used for the problem of [[multiple sequence alignment]] which involves aligning many DNA or amino acid sequences in order to determine regions of similarity that could indicate a shared evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
It can also be used to detect and visualize genome rearrangements.&lt;ref name="rearrang"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratas|first=D|author2=Silva, R|author3= Pinho, A|author4= Ferreira, P|title=An alignment-free method to find and visualise rearrangements between pairs of DNA sequences.|journal=Scientific Reports (Group Nature)|date=May 18, 2015|volume=5|number=10203|pmid=25984837|doi=10.1038/srep10203|pages=10203|pmc=4434998|bibcode=2015NatSR...510203P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proteomics ===
[[File:C16orf95 protein secondary structure prediction.png|thumb|A protein's amino acid sequence annotated with the protein secondary structure. Each amino acid is labeled as either an alpha helix, a beta sheet, or a coil.]]
[[Protein]]s, strings of [[amino acid]]s, gain much of their function from [[protein folding]] in which they conform into a three-dimensional structure. This structure is composed of a number of layers of folding, including the [[Protein primary structure|primary structure]] (i.e. the flat string of amino acids), the [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure]] ([[Alpha helix|alpha helices]] and [[beta sheet]]s), the [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structure]], and the [[Protein quaternary structure|quartenary structure]].

Protein secondary structure prediction is a main focus of this subfield as the further protein foldings (tertiary and quartenary structures) are determined based on the secondary structure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Solving the true structure of a protein is an incredibly expensive and time-intensive process, furthering the need for systems that can accurately predict the structure of a protein by analyzing the amino acid sequence directly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Prior to machine learning, researchers needed to conduct this prediction manually. This trend began in 1951 when Pauling and Corey released their work on predicting the hydrogen bond configurations of a protein from a polypeptide chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pauling|first=L.|last2=Corey|first2=R. B.|last3=Branson|first3=H. R.|date=April 1, 1951|title=The structure of proteins; two hydrogen-bonded helical configurations of the polypeptide chain|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=37|issue=4|pages=205–211|issn=0027-8424|pmc=1063337|pmid=14816373|doi=10.1073/pnas.37.4.205|bibcode=1951PNAS...37..205P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, through the use of automatic feature learning, the best machine learning techniques are able to achieve an accuracy of 82-84%.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The current state-of-the-art in secondary structure prediction uses a system called DeepCNF (deep convolutional neural fields) which relies on the machine learning model of [[artificial neural network]]s to achieve an accuracy of approximately 84% when tasked to classify the amino acids of a protein sequence into one of three structural classes (helix, sheet, or coil).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Sheng|last2=Peng|first2=Jian|last3=Ma|first3=Jianzhu|last4=Xu|first4=Jinbo|date=December 1, 2015|title=Protein secondary structure prediction using deep convolutional neural fields|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=18962|arxiv=1512.00843|bibcode=2016NatSR...618962W|doi=10.1038/srep18962|pmid=26752681|pmc=4707437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical limit for three-state protein secondary structure is 88–90%.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Machine learning has also been applied to proteomics problems such as [[Side chain|protein side-chain]] prediction, [[Turn (biochemistry)|protein loop]] modeling, and [[protein contact map]] prediction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Microarrays ===
Microarrays, a type of [[lab-on-a-chip]], are used for automatically collecting data about large amounts of biological material. Machine learning can aid in the analysis of this data, and it has been applied to expression pattern identification, classification, and genetic network induction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:DNA-microarray analysis.jpg|thumb|A DNA-microarray analysis of Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is shown and identifies differences in gene expression patterns.]]
This technology is especially useful for monitoring the expression of genes within a genome, aiding in diagnosing different types of cancer based on which genes are expressed.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pirooznia|first=Mehdi|last2=Yang|first2=Jack Y.|last3=Yang|first3=Mary Qu|last4=Deng|first4=Youping|date=2008|title=A comparative study of different machine learning methods on microarray gene expression data|journal=BMC Genomics|volume=9|issue=1|pages=S13|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-9-S1-S13|issn=1471-2164|pmc=2386055|pmid=18366602}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main problems in this field is identifying which genes are expressed based on the collected data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, due to the huge number of genes on which data is collected by the microarray, there is a large amount of irrelevant data to the task of expressed gene identification, further complicating this problem. Machine learning presents a potential solution to this problem as various classification methods can be used to perform this identification. The most commonly used methods are [[radial basis function network]]s, [[deep learning]], [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayesian classification]], [[decision tree]]s, and [[random forest]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Systems biology ===
Systems biology focuses on the study of the emergent behaviors from complex interactions of simple biological components in a system. Such components can include molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/researchtopic/2362/machine-learning-in-molecular-systems-biology|title=Machine Learning in Molecular Systems Biology|website=Frontiers|language=en|access-date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machine learning has been used to aid in the modelling of these complex interactions in biological systems in domains such as genetic networks, signal transduction networks, and metabolic pathways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Graphical model|Probabilistic graphical models]], a machine learning technique for determining the structure between different variables, are one of the most commonly used methods for modeling genetic networks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, machine learning has been applied to systems biology problems such as identifying [[DNA binding site|transcription factor binding sites]] using a technique known as [[Markov chain|Markov chain optimization]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Genetic algorithm]]s, machine learning techniques which are based on the natural process of evolution, have been used to model genetic networks and regulatory structures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other systems biology applications of machine learning include the task of enzyme function prediction, high throughput microarray data analysis, analysis of genome-wide association studies to better understand markers of disease, protein function prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=d'Alché-Buc|first=Florence|last2=Wehenkel|first2=Louis|date=2008|title=Machine Learning in Systems Biology|journal=BMC Proceedings|volume=2|issue=4|pages=S1|doi=10.1186/1753-6561-2-S4-S1|pmid=19091048|pmc=2654969|issn=1753-6561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stroke Diagnosis ===
Machine learning methods for analysis of [[neuroimaging]] data are used to help diagnose [[stroke]]. Three-dimensional [[Convolutional neural network|CNN]] and [[Support-vector machine|SVM]] methods are often used. 
&lt;ref name="stroke1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jiang |first1=Fei |title=Artificial intelligence in healthcare: past, present and future |journal=BMJ Journals Stroke and Vascular Neurology |date=2017 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=230–243 |doi=10.1136/svn-2017-000101 |pmid=29507784 |pmc=5829945 |url=https://svn.bmj.com/content/svnbmj/2/4/230.full.pdf |accessdate=23 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Text mining ===
The increase in available biological publications led to the issue of the increase in difficulty in searching through and compiling all the relevant available information on a given topic across all sources. This task is known as [[knowledge extraction]]. This is necessary for biological data collection which can then in turn be fed into machine learning algorithms to generate new biological knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krallinger|first=Martin|last2=Erhardt|first2=Ramon Alonso-Allende|last3=Valencia|first3=Alfonso|date=March 15, 2005|title=Text-mining approaches in molecular biology and biomedicine|journal=Drug Discovery Today|volume=10|issue=6|pages=439–445|doi=10.1016/S1359-6446(05)03376-3|pmid=15808823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machine learning can be used for this knowledge extraction task using techniques such as [[natural language processing]] to extract the useful information from human-generated reports in a database. [[Text Nailing]], an alternative approach to machine learning, capable of extracting features from clinical narrative notes was introduced in 2017.

This technique has been applied to the search for novel drug targets, as this task requires the examination of information stored in biological databases and journals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Annotations of proteins in protein databases often do not reflect the complete known set of knowledge of each protein, so additional information must be extracted from biomedical literature. Machine learning has been applied to automatic annotation of the function of genes and proteins, determination of the [[Protein targeting|subcellular localization of a protein]], analysis of [[Gene expression|DNA-expression arrays]], large-scale [[List of protein interactions|protein interaction]] analysis, and molecule interaction analysis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Another application of text mining is the detection and visualization of distinct DNA regions given sufficient reference data.&lt;ref name="sing"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratas|first=D|author2=Hosseini, M|author3=Silva, R|author4= Pinho, A|author5= Ferreira, P|title=Visualization of Distinct DNA Regions of the Modern Human Relatively to a Neanderthal Genome|journal=Iberian Conference on Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis. Springer|volume=10255|pages=235–242|date= June 20–23, 2017|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-58838-4_26|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-319-58837-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|fenestra|fenestration}}
A '''fenestra''' ('''fenestration'''; plural '''fenestrae''' or '''fenestrations''') is any small opening or pore, commonly used as a term in the [[biology|biological sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fenestra - definition of fenestra in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/fenestra|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Latin]] for the word "window", and is used in various fields to describe a pore in an [[anatomy|anatomical]] structure.

== Biological morphology ==
In [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], fenestrae are found in [[cancellous bone]]s, particularly in the [[Skull#Fenestrae|skull]]. In [[anatomy]], the [[round window]] and [[oval window]] are also known as the ''fenestra rotunda'' and the ''fenestra ovalis''. In [[microanatomy]], fenestrae are found in [[endothelium]] of [[Capillary#Fenestrated|fenestrated capillaries]], enabling the rapid exchange of [[molecule]]s between the blood and surrounding [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]. The [[internal elastic lamina|elastic layer]] of the [[tunica intima]] is a fenestrated membrane. In [[surgery]], a fenestration is a new opening made in a part of the body to enable drainage or access.

== Plant biology ==
In [[plant biology]], the perforations in a [[perforate leaf]] are also described as fenestrae, and the leaf is called a fenestrate leaf.  The [[leaf window]] is also known as a fenestra, and is a translucent structure that transmits light, as in ''[[Fenestraria]]''.

== Zoology ==
In [[zoology]], the trilobite ''[[Fenestraspis]]'' possessed extensive fenestrae in the posterior part of the body. In the [[paleognathae]], there is an ilio–ischiatic fenestra.

'''Diploidization''' is the process of converting a polyploid genome back into a diploid one. [[Polyploid]]y is a product of whole genome duplication (WGD) and is followed by diploidization as a result of genome shock.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Hufton, A. L. and G.

Yesterday’s Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333-41.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant kingdom has undergone multiple events of polyploidization followed by diploidization in both ancient and recent lineages.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been hypothesized that vertebrate genomes have gone through two rounds of [[paleopolyploidy]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Kenneth H. Yesterday's Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333–341.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms of diploidization are poorly understood but patterns of chromosomal loss and evolution of novel genes are observed in the process.

== Elimination of duplicated genes ==

Upon the formation of new polyploids, large sections of DNA are rapidly lost from one genome.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of DNA effectively achieves two purposes. First, the eliminated copy restores the normal gene dosage in the diploid organism.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the changes in chromosomal genetic structure increase the divergence of the homoeologous chromosomes (similar chromosomes from inter-species hybrid) and promotes [[homologous chromosome]] pairing.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt; Both are important in terms of adjusting to the induced genome shock.

== Evolution of genes to ensure correct chromosome pairing ==

There have been rare events in which genes that ensure proper chromosome pairing have evolved shortly after polyploidization. One such gene, Ph1, exists in hexaploid wheat.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Perez, E,, P. Shaw and G. Moore The Ph1 locus is needed to ensure specific somatic and meiotic centromere association Nature 411: 204-207&lt;/ref&gt; These genes keep the two sets of genomes separately by either spatially separating them or giving them a unique chromatin identity to facilitate recognition from its homologous pair. This prevents the need of rapid gene loss to speed up homeologous chromosome diversification.

== Drive for diploidization ==
; Coordinate inter-genomic gene expression
: Duplicated genes often result in increased dosage of gene products. Doubled dosages are sometimes lethal to the organism thus the two genome copies must coordinate in a structured fashion to maintain normal nuclear activity.&lt;ref&gt;Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; Many mechanisms of diploidization promote this coordination.
; Maintain intra-genomic chromosome pairing at meiosis
: Chromosome pairing during meiosis is a significant challenge for polyploids. Homoeologous chromosomes with similar genetic content may pair with each other resulting in trivalent or tetravalent interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution of these structures results in chromosome breakage, rearrangement, and gamete infertility. Diploidization is often required to restore the cell’s ability to stably go through meiosis.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt;
; Reduce costs of maintaining large, duplicated genomes
: Large genomes are costly to synthesize during replication and hard to maintain.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of duplicated genes during diploidization effectively reduces the overall size of the genome.

== Revolutionary vs. evolutionary changes ==
Once a polyploid is made, either synthetically or naturally, the genome goes through a period of "genome shock". Genome shock can be defined as a stage in which the genome experiences massive reorganization and structural changes to deal with the external stress (X-ray damage, chromosome duplication, etc.) imposed upon the genome.&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, Barbara The significance of responses of the genome to challenge Science 1984, 226: 792–801&lt;/ref&gt; Such changes are termed '''revolutionary changes''' and occur early in the process of diploidization.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary changes ensure that the organism has a stable genome that can be passed to its progeny.

At the end of this process, certain duplicated genes may be preserved thus allowing evolution to shape them into novel functions. This is commonly termed as neofunctionalization. The mechanism of retaining duplicated genes is poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that dosage balance may play a key role in shaping the evolutionary fates of duplicated genes.&lt;ref&gt; Conant, G.C., J. A. Birchler, and J. C. Pires Dosage, duplication, and diploidization: clarifying the interplay of multiple models for duplicate gene evolution over time. Current Opinion in Plant Biology 2014, 19: 91–98&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary changes refer to the long process of converting duplicated genes into diverse, functional gene derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
There are many ways in which a polyploid organism can convert back to a diploid status. This is usually achieved by elimination of duplicated genes. The main goals of diploidization are: (1) To ensure proper gene dosage; and (2) to maintain stable cellular division processes. This process does not need to occur rapidly for all chromosomes in one or few steps. In recent polyploid events, segments of the genome may still remain in a tetraploid status. In other words, diploidization is a long ongoing process that is shaped by both intrinsic and evolutionary drives.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Kenneth H. Yesterday’s Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333–341.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abnormal chromosome pairing ===
Normally, homologous chromosomes pair up in bivalents during meiosis and separate into different daughter cells. However, when multiple copies of similar chromosomes are present in the nucleus, homeologous chromosomes can also pair with homologous chromosomes resulting in the formation of trivalents or multivalents.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of multivalents results in unequal division of the chromosomes and lead to daughter cells lacking one or few chromosomes.

=== Illegitimate recombination ===
When homeologous chromosomes pair up though bivalents or multivalents, illegitimate genetic crossovers may occur.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; Since the chromosomes may differ in genetic structure and content, segments of the chromosome may be shuffled around resulting in massive gene loss. Additionally, [[illegitimate recombination]]s may also result in dicentric chromosomes lead to chromosome breakage during anaphase.&lt;ref&gt;Hufton, A. L. and G. Panopoulou Polyploidy and genome restructuring: a variety of outcomes Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development 2009, 19: 600–606&lt;/ref&gt; This further contributes to gene loss on duplicated chromosomes.

=== Relaxed selective pressure on duplicated genes ===
The duplicated copies of a gene are commonly non-essential to the plant’s ability to maintain normal growth and development. Therefore, one copy is generally free to mutate/be lost from the genome.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Moshe and Avraham A. Levy Genome evolution in allopolyploid wheat—a revolutionary reprogramming followed by gradual changes. J. Genet. Genomics 2009, 36: 511–518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Kenneth H. Yesterday’s Polyploids and the Mystery of Diploidization Nat Rev Genet. 2001 May;2(5): 333-41.&lt;/ref&gt; This contributes to gene loss through the massive chromosome reorganization events during genome shock.

=== Neofunctionalization ===
As mentioned earlier, duplicated genes are under relaxed selective pressure. Thus it may also be subject to [[neofunctionalization]], the process in which a duplicated gene obtains a novel function.

      <text bytes="7469" xml:space="preserve">'''The Biotron''' is a research facility located at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] that "provides controlled environments and climate-controlled greenhouses to support plant, animal, and materials research for university, non-profit, and commercial clients."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biotron|url=https://biotron.wisc.edu/|website=Biotron Laboratory|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
An evolution of the [[phytotron]], the development of the facility had its roots in the late 1950s as a campaign established by the [[Botanical Society of America]] in search of a national phytotron.&lt;ref name=munns&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Engineering_the_Environment.html?id=kdssDwAAQBAJ&amp;q=biotron|last1=Munns|first1=David P. D.|title=Engineering the Environment: Phytotrons and the Quest for Climate Control in the Cold War|date=2017-05-30|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=9780822982760|language=en|pages=196–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|196}} With additional funding and support by the [[National Science Foundation]] the Biotron was eventually envisioned as a combination facility that would allow both plant and animal tests to be conducted.

Plant physiologist [[Folke Skoog]] would be instrumental in bringing the Biotron to the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. A colleague of [[Frits Went]] at Caltech, Skoog oversaw the two proposals the university submitted to the Botanical Society in 1959.&lt;ref name=munns /&gt;{{rp|203}} The interdisciplinary nature and scope of the project quickly led it to becoming Madison's most expensive facility at around $4.2 million.&lt;ref name=munns /&gt;{{rp|202}} It was up to Harold Senn, appointed director of the Biotron to concentrate on assembling funding, which he was able to accomplish by January 1963, with the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[National Institute of Health]] contributing to the project.&lt;ref name=munns /&gt;{{rp|210}}

The Biotron was officially dedicated on September 18, 1970 with many experiments under precise controlled environmental conditions already under study, such as a lizard in the Palm Springs desert or black-eyed peas growing in hot and humid Nigeria.&lt;ref name=times1970&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/19/archives/environment-center-dedicated-wisconsins-biotron-permits-research-in.html|title=Environment Center Dedicated|last=Wilford|first=John Noble|date=1970-09-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When finally completed in 1971, the Biotron contained over fifty rooms with many able to variate temperature from as low as -25C to as high as 50C with humidity adjustable anywhere from 1%-100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biotron manual for investigators|last=Senn|first=H. A.|last2=Anderson|first2=D. P.|last3=Anderson|first3=L.

Senn supposedly spent an additional $3,000 of the Biotron budget on increasing the computer's memory an extra 4 [[kilobytes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biotron|url=http://www.worldoftrons.com/blog/2017/2/22/biotron|website=World of Trons|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Biotron went through a period of decline in the 1980s, unlike other facilities it never closed. In 1986, the first experiments using [[LED]]s to grow plants were developed with [[NASA]] and tests were performed for the [[Galileo probe]] before its 1989 launch.&lt;ref name=isthmus&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://isthmus.com/news/news/uw-madison-biotron-climate-simulation/|title=Field stations in a box|last=Merfeld|first=Liz|date=March 2, 2016|work=Isthmus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its work in the 1990s partnered with NASA in the [[Controlled Ecological Life Support System]] (CELSS) and its goal in researching the viability of certain vegetables for space travel, in particular the [[potato]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/206266590/|title= Invention may lead to space salads|date=June 13, 1992|page=6|work=Iowa City Press-Citizen from Iowa City, Iowa|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="munns" /&gt;{{rp|224}} Study of animal hibernation were done by [[ESA]] for human space exploration.&lt;ref name=isthmus /&gt;

==Rooms==
The Biotron has 45 rooms that are capable of simulating a range of environmental variables with precision and control. These rooms feature separate air handling and control over the temperature, humidity, and lighting. Some rooms specialize in isolation from sound and vibration, electromagnetic radiation, or pressure.&lt;ref name=times1970 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biotron.wisc.edu/controlled-environments/|title=Controlled Environments|website=Biotron Laboratory|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological hermeneutics came into being after the development of the [[microscope]] during the seventeenth century. The most celebrated practitioner [[Robert Hooke]] devoted two of his 'Schema' of his ground breaking book ''Micrographia'' to the study of the [[Microbiomes of the built environment|microbiome]] of the book.

Schema 12  was drawn from studying the red covers of a ‘small book’ which he judged to be made of ‘Sheeps skin’, he found:&lt;blockquote&gt;… a small white spot of hairy mould, multitudes of which I found to bespeck &amp; whiten [the book]. These spots appear’d, through a good Microscope, to be a very pretty shap’d Vegetative body, which, from almost the same part of the Leather, shot out multitudes of small long cylindrical and transparent stalks …&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hooke/robert/micrographia/observ20.html|title=Micrographia, by Robert Hooke : observ20|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schema 33 is dedicated to '''the study of the small silver coloured'' book-worm'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hooke/robert/micrographia/observ52.html|title=Micrographia, by Robert Hooke : Observ. LII. Of the small Silver-colour'd Book-worm.|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the discipline stalled however with the ascendance of [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] to the presidency of the Royal Society where he 'did much to obscure Hooke'.

A collection of books maintaining the investigation of the transdiscipline can be found at [[Chetham's Library]] where the practice was developed from Hooke's initial investigations through the collecting policy of successive librarians who 'set out to acquire a major collection of books and manuscripts that would cover the whole range of available knowledge and would rival the college libraries of Oxford and Cambridge'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://library.chethams.com/history/|title=Chetham's Library {{!}} History|work=Chetham's Library|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to collect biological material for later study books were sent out into the community as parish libraries. Gorton library is the last surviving example and has yet to be investigated using Biological Hermeneutic techniques.

In 1831 the foundation of the British Association for the Advancement of Science led to the popularisation of science and enabled a wider group to undertake their own investigations outside of the Royal Society creating a space for the further development of the practice.

'''Neural computation''' is the hypothetical information processing performed by networks of [[neuron]]s. Neural computation is affiliated with the philosophical tradition known as [[Computational theory of mind]], also referred to as computationalism, which advances the thesis that neural computation explains cognition. The first persons to propose an account of neural activity as being computational was [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch|Warren McCullock]] and [[Walter Pitts]] in their seminal 1943 paper, A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity. There are three general branches of computationalism, including classicism, [[connectionism]], and [[computational neuroscience]]. All three branches agree that cognition is computation, however they disagree on what sorts of computations constitute cognition. The classicism tradition believes that computation in the brain is digital, analogous with digital computing. Both connectionism and computational neuroscience do not require that the computations which realize cognition are necessarily digital computations. However, the two branches greatly disagree upon which sorts of experimental data should be used to construct explanatory models of cognitive phenomena. Connectionists rely upon behavioral evidence to construct models to explain cognitive phenomenon, whereas computational neuroscience leverages neuroanatomical and neurophysiological information to construct mathematical models which explain cognition.

When comparing the three main traditions of the computational theory of mind, as well as the different possible forms of computation in the brain, it is helpful to define what we mean by computation in a general sense. Computation is the processing of vehicles, otherwise known as variables or entities, according to a set of rules. A rule in this sense is simply an instruction for executing a manipulation on the current state of the variable, in order to produce an specified output. In other words, a rule dictates which output to produce given a certain input to the computing system. A computing system is a mechanism whose components must be functionally organized to process the vehicles in accordance with the established set of rules. The types of vehicles processed by a computing system determines which type of computations it performs. Traditionally, in cognitive science there have been two proposed types of computation related to neural activity - [[Digital computer|digital]] and [[Analog computer|analog]], with the vast majority of theoretical work incorporating a digital understanding of cognition. Computing systems which perform digital computation are functionally organized to execute operations on strings of digits with respect to the type and location of the digit on the string. It has been argued that neural spike train signaling implements some form of digital computation, since [[Action potential|neural spikes]] may be considered as discrete units or digits, like 0 or 1 - the neuron either fires an action potential or it does not. Accordingly, neural spike trains could be seen as strings of digits. Alternatively, analog computing systems perform manipulations on non-discrete, irreducibly continuous variables, that is, entities which vary continuously as a function of time. These sorts of operations are characterized by systems of differential equations.

Neural computation can be studied for example by building [[models of neural computation]].

There is a scientific journal dedicated to this subject, ''[[Neural Computation (journal)|Neural Computation]]''.

[[Artificial neural network]]s (ANN) is subfield of the research area [[machine learning]]. Work on ANNs has been somewhat inspired by knowledge of neural computation.

'''Infectious tolerance''' is a term referring to a phenomenon where a tolerance-inducing state is transferred from one cell population to another. It can be induced in many ways; although it is often artificially induced, it is a natural ''in vivo'' process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobbold|first=S.|last2=Waldmann|first2=H.|date=October 1998|title=Infectious tolerance|journal=Current Opinion in Immunology|volume=10|issue=5|pages=518–524|issn=0952-7915|pmid=9794831|doi=10.1016/S0952-7915(98)80217-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of research deal with the development of a strategy utilizing this phenomenon in transplantation immunology. The goal is to achieve long-term tolerance of the [[Transplant rejection|transplant]] through short-term therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kendal|first=Adrian R.|last2=Waldmann|first2=Herman|date=October 2010|title=Infectious tolerance: therapeutic potential|journal=Current Opinion in Immunology|volume=22|issue=5|pages=560–565|doi=10.1016/j.coi.2010.08.002|issn=1879-0372|pmid=20829013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term "infectious tolerance" was originally used by Gershon and Kondo in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gershon|first=R.

Later developed new tolerogenic strategies have provided strong evidence to re-evaluate the phenomenon of T cell mediated suppression, in particular the use of non-depleting anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating that neither [[thymus]] nor [[clonal deletion]] is necessary to induce tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Qin|first=S.

[[File:Immunoregulation by regulatory T cells (Treg)..jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Treg migrate to the grafted tissue. Activated Treg convert ATP released by inflamed tissues to adenosine via the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73. Local adenosine could contribute to the initial “privileged” microenvironment. Treg also secrete TGF-β and IL-10 which inhibit the maturation and migration of dendritic cells (DC). These “decommissioned” DC can secrete catabolic enzymes for depletion of essential amino acids (EAA) and, therefore, induce apoptosis of effector T cells. Moreover, the “privileged” tissues could release pro-apoptotic galectin-9 which binds to TIM-3 expressed by effector T cells such as Th1 and Th17. This further amplifies the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Each of these components within the graft can further reinforce the local anti-inflammatory state such that any naive T cell, migrating into this area, will be converted to induced Treg (iTreg) through infectious tolerance. The iTreg then expand and further suppress immunity in the “privileged” microenvironment.]]
During a tolerant state potential effector cells remain but are tightly regulated by induced antigen-specific CD4+ [[regulatory T cell]]s (iTregs). Many subsets of iTregs play a part in this proces, but CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD25&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;FoxP3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Tregs play a key role, because they have the ability to convert conventional T cells into iTregs directly by secretion of the suppressive cytokines [[Transforming growth factor beta|TGF-β]], [[IL-10 family|IL-10]] or [[Interleukin 35|IL-35]], or indirectly via [[Dendritic cell|dendritic cells (DCs)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gravano|first=David M.|last2=Vignali|first2=Dario A.A.|date=June 2012|title=The Battle Against Immunopathology: Infectious Tolerance Mediated by Regulatory T Cells|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|volume=69|issue=12|pages=1997–2008|doi=10.1007/s00018-011-0907-z|issn=1420-682X|pmc=3353028|pmid=22205213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of IL-10 induces the formation of another population of regulatory T cells called Tr1.

Glycogen functions as one of two forms of energy reserves, glycogen being for short-term and the other form being [[triglyceride]] stores in [[adipose tissue]] (i.e., body fat) for long-term storage. In [[human]]s, glycogen is made and stored primarily in the cells of the [[liver]] and [[skeletal muscle]].&lt;ref name="Glucose-Glycogen storage review"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wasserman DH|date=January 2009|title=Four grams of glucose|journal=American Journal of Physiology.

Glycogen is the analogue of [[starch]], a glucose [[polymer]] that functions as energy storage in [[plant]]s. It has a structure similar to [[amylopectin]] (a component of starch), but is more extensively branched and compact than starch. Both are white [[powder (substance)|powders]] in their dry state. Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the [[cytosol]]/cytoplasm in many [[cell (biology)|cell]] types, and plays an important role in the [[glucose cycle]]. Glycogen forms an [[energy]] reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose, but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of [[triglycerides]] (lipids). As such it is also found as storage reserve in many parasitic protozoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryley|first1=JF|title=Studies on the metabolism of the protozoa. 5.

Glycogen is a branched [[biopolymer]] consisting of linear chains of [[glucose]] [[Residue (chemistry)|residues]] with an average chain length of approximately 8–12 glucose units.&lt;ref&gt;Manners, D. J. Carbohydr. Polym. 1991, 16, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose units are linked together linearly by α(1→4) [[glycosidic bond]]s from one glucose to the next. Branches are linked to the chains from which they are branching off by α(1→6) glycosidic bonds between the first glucose of the new branch and a glucose on the stem chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Biochemistry |edition = 7th, International |last = Berg, Tymoczko &amp; Stryer |year = 2012 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = 978-1429203142 |page = 338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the way glycogen is synthesised, every glycogen granule has at its core a [[glycogenin]] protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Biochemistry |edition = 7th, International |last = Berg|year = 2012 |publisher = W. H. Freeman |isbn = |page = 650|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glycogen in muscle, liver, and fat cells is stored in a hydrated form, composed of three or four parts of water per part of glycogen associated with 0.45&amp;nbsp;[[Molar concentration#Units|millimoles]] (18&amp;nbsp;mg) of potassium per gram of glycogen.&lt;ref name="pmid1615908"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kreitzman SN, Coxon AY, Szaz KF | title=Glycogen storage: illusions of easy weight loss, excessive weight regain, and distortions in estimates of body composition | journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=56 | issue=1 Suppl | year=1992 | pages=292s–93s  | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/56/1/292S.full.pdf | id= | pmid=1615908| doi=10.1093/ajcn/56.1.292S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glucose is an osmotic molecule, and can have profound effects on osmotic pressure in high concentrations possibly leading to cell damage or death if stored in the cell without being modified.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt;  Glycogen is a non-osmotic molecule, so it can be used as a solution to storing glucose in the cell without disrupting osmotic pressure.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt;

==Functions==

===Liver===
As a meal containing [[carbohydrate]]s or protein is eaten and [[digestion|digested]], [[blood glucose]] levels rise, and the [[pancreas]] secretes [[insulin]]. Blood glucose from the [[portal vein]] enters liver cells ([[hepatocyte]]s). Insulin acts on the hepatocytes to stimulate the action of several [[enzyme]]s, including [[glycogen synthase]]. Glucose molecules are added to the chains of glycogen as long as both insulin and glucose remain plentiful. In this [[postprandial]] or "fed" state, the liver takes in more glucose from the blood than it releases.

After a meal has been digested and glucose levels begin to fall, insulin secretion is reduced, and glycogen synthesis stops. When it is needed for [[Food energy|energy]], glycogen is broken down and converted again to glucose. [[Glycogen phosphorylase]] is the primary enzyme of glycogen breakdown. For the next 8–12 hours, glucose derived from liver glycogen is the primary source of blood glucose used by the rest of the body for fuel.

[[Glucagon]], another hormone produced by the pancreas, in many respects serves as a countersignal to insulin. In response to insulin levels being below normal (when blood levels of glucose begin to fall below the normal range), glucagon is secreted in increasing amounts and stimulates both [[glycogenolysis]] (the breakdown of glycogen) and [[gluconeogenesis]] (the production of glucose from other sources).

===Muscle===
[[Skeletal muscle|Muscle cell]] glycogen appears to function as an immediate reserve source of available glucose for muscle cells. Other cells that contain small amounts use it locally, as well. As muscle cells lack [[glucose-6-phosphatase]], which is required to pass glucose into the blood, the glycogen they store is available solely for internal use and is not shared with other cells. This is in contrast to liver cells, which, on demand, readily do break down their stored glycogen into glucose and send it through the blood stream as fuel for other organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oregonstate.edu/instruct/bb450/summer09/lecture/glycogennotes.html|title=Glycogen Biosynthesis; Glycogen Breakdown|website=oregonstate.edu|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Glycogen was discovered by [[Claude Bernard]]. His experiments showed that the liver contained a substance that could give rise to reducing sugar by the action of a "ferment" in the liver. By 1857, he described the isolation of a substance he called "''la matière glycogène''", or "sugar-forming substance". Soon after the discovery of glycogen in the liver, A. Sanson found that muscular tissue also contains glycogen. The empirical formula for glycogen of ({{chem|C|6|H|10|O|5}})&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; was established by [[August Kekulé|Kekulé]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=F. G. Young |title=Claude Bernard and the Discovery of Glycogen|journal=British Medical Journal |volume=1 |issue=5033 (Jun. 22, 1957) |pages=1431–37 |year=1957 |jstor=25382898 |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5033.1431|pmid=13436813|pmc=1973429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism==

===Synthesis===
{{Main|Glycogenesis}}

Glycogen synthesis is, unlike its breakdown, [[endergonic]]—it requires the input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from [[uridine triphosphate]] (UTP), which reacts with [[glucose-1-phosphate]], forming [[UDP-glucose]], in a reaction catalysed by [[UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase]]. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of [[UDP-glucose]] initially by the protein [[glycogenin]], which has two [[tyrosine]] anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules have been added to a tyrosine residue, the enzyme [[glycogen synthase]] progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose to the reducing end of the glycogen chain.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, D. (2013) Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry, 6th ed., W.H. Freeman and Company (p. 618)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glycogen branching enzyme]] catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven glucose residues from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.

===Breakdown===
{{Main|Glycogenolysis}}
Glycogen is cleaved from the nonreducing ends of the chain by the enzyme [[glycogen phosphorylase]] to produce monomers of glucose-1-phosphate:

[[File:Glycogen phosphorylase stereo.png|600px|center|Action of Glycogen Phosphorylase on Glycogen]]

In vivo, phosphorolysis proceeds in the direction of glycogen breakdown because the ratio of phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate is usually greater than 100.&lt;ref&gt;Stryer, L. (1988) Biochemistry, 3rd ed., Freeman (p. 451)&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose-1-phosphate is then converted to [[G6P|glucose 6-phosphate]] (G6P) by [[phosphoglucomutase]]. A special [[glycogen debranching enzyme|debranching enzyme]] is needed to remove the α(1-6) branches in branched glycogen and reshape the chain into a linear polymer. The G6P monomers produced have three possible fates:
* G6P can continue on the [[glycolysis]] pathway and be used as fuel.
* G6P can enter the [[pentose phosphate pathway]] via the enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] to produce NADPH and 5-carbon sugars.
* In the liver and kidney, G6P can be dephosphorylated back to glucose by the enzyme [[glucose 6-phosphatase]]. This is the final step in the [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway.

==Clinical relevance==

===Disorders of glycogen metabolism===
The most common disease in which glycogen [[metabolism]] becomes abnormal is [[diabetes]], in which, because of abnormal amounts of insulin, liver glycogen can be abnormally accumulated or depleted. Restoration of normal glucose metabolism usually normalizes glycogen metabolism, as well.

In [[hypoglycemia]] caused by excessive insulin, liver glycogen levels are high, but the high insulin levels prevent the [[glycogenolysis]] necessary to maintain normal blood sugar levels. [[Glucagon]] is a common treatment for this type of hypoglycemia.

Various [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]] are caused by deficiencies of enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis or breakdown. These are collectively referred to as [[glycogen storage disease]]s.

===Glycogen depletion and endurance exercise===
{{See also|Central nervous system fatigue}}
Long-distance athletes, such as [[Marathon (sport)|marathon]] runners, [[Cross-country skiing|cross-country skiers]], and [[cyclist]]s, often experience glycogen depletion, where almost all of the athlete's glycogen stores are depleted after long periods of exertion without sufficient carbohydrate consumption. This phenomenon is referred to as "[[hitting the wall]]".

Glycogen depletion can be forestalled in three possible ways. First, during exercise, carbohydrates with the highest possible rate of conversion to blood glucose (high [[glycemic index]]) are ingested continuously. The best possible outcome of this strategy replaces about 35% of glucose consumed at heart rates above about 80% of maximum. Second, through endurance training adaptations and specialized regimens (e.g. fasting low-intensity endurance training), the body can condition [[type I muscle]] fibers to improve both fuel use efficiency and workload capacity to increase the percentage of fatty acids used as fuel,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/training/methods-of-endurance-training-part-1.html | title=Methods of Endurance Training Part 1| date=2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/qa-steady-state-vs-tempo-training-and-fat-loss.html | title=Steady State vs. Tempo Training and Fat Loss| date=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; sparing carbohydrate use from all sources. Third, by consuming large quantities of carbohydrates after depleting glycogen stores as a result of exercise or diet, the body can increase storage capacity of intramuscular glycogen stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.directlyfitness.com/store/carbing-cyclical-ketogenic-diet/ |last=McDonald |first=Lyle |title=Research Review: An In-Depth Look Into Carbing Up On The Cyclical Ketogenic Diet |access-date=19 February 2017|date=2012-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lyle. ''The Ketogenic Diet: A Complete Guide for the Dieter and the Practitioner. ''Lyle McDonald, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Costill DL et. al. Muscle glycogen utilization during prolonged exercise on successive days. J Appl Physiol (1971) 31: 834–38."&lt;/ref&gt; This process is known as [[carbohydrate loading]]. In general, glycemic index of carbohydrate source does not matter since muscular insulin sensitivity is increased as a result of temporary glycogen depletion.&lt;ref&gt;Glycogen depletion and increased insulin sensitivity and responsiveness in muscle after exerciseAm J Physiol Endocrinol MetabDecember 1, 1986&amp;nbsp;251:(6) E664–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lyle. The Ultimate Diet 2.0. Lyle McDonald, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

When experiencing glycogen debt, athletes often experience extreme [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] to the point that it is difficult to move. As a reference,{{according to|date=July 2019}} the very best professional cyclists in the world{{examples|date=July 2019}} will usually{{when|date=July 2019}} finish a 4- to 5-hr stage race right at the limit of glycogen depletion using the first three strategies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

When athletes ingest both carbohydrate and [[caffeine]] following exhaustive exercise, their glycogen stores tend to be replenished more rapidly;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Pedersen DJ, Lessard SJ, Coffey VG, etal |title=High rates of muscle glycogen resynthesis after exhaustive exercise when carbohydrate is coingested with caffeine |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=7–13 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18467543 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01121.2007 |type=Original article }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Recovery nutrition review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beelen M, Burke LM, Gibala MJ, ((van Loon LJC)) | title = Nutritional strategies to promote postexercise recovery | journal = International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 515–32 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21116024 | doi = 10.1123/ijsnem.20.6.515 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/11196140caacf1e54cb6be1d9d19dc3999c49189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the minimum dose of caffeine at which there is a [[clinically significant]] effect on glycogen repletion has not been established.&lt;ref name="Recovery nutrition review" /&gt;

A '''bioactive terrarium''' (or [[vivarium]]) is a [[terrarium]] for housing one or more terrestrial [[animal]]s which also includes populations of small [[invertebrate]]s and [[microorganism]]s to consume and break down the waste products of the primary species.  This population of [[decomposer]]s is colloquially referred to as the "cleanup crew" (abbr. "CUC"), and can include terrestrial [[isopod]]s, [[springtail]]s, [[earthworm]]s, [[millipede]]s, and various [[beetle]]s as determined by compatibility with the habitat of the primary species (e.g. tropical rainforest vs. desert).  In a fully functional bioactive terrarium, all of the waste products will be broken down by the cleanup crew, eliminating the need for cage cleaning and preventing odors.  While most bioactive terrariums are also naturalistic ((with live plants, soil, lighting, and naturalistic decor), a terrarium may be bioactive without being naturalistic, and naturalistic without being bioactive).

==Enclosure==
Although any enclosure can be made bioactive by addition of a "cleanup crew" and appropriate substrate, such enclosures are almost always naturalistic terraria constructed of PVC, wood, glass and/or acrylic; bioactive enclosures in "rack" style caging is uncommon. 

==Substrate==
Bioactive enclosures require some form of particulate substrate to provide habitat for the cleanup crew.  The choice of substrate is typically determined by the habitat of the primary species (e.g. jungle vs desert), and created by mixing a variety of components such as organic topsoil (free of pesticides and non-biological fertilizers), peat, coco fiber, sand, long-fiber sphagnum moss, cypress mulch, and orchid bark in varying proportions.  In wet habitats, there is typically a layer of coarse rocks beneath the substrate to allow drainage, separated from the overlying substrate with a fine plastic mesh.  Additionally, some bioactive terraria include leaflitter, which can serve as food and microhabitat for the cleanup crew.

==Cleanup crew==
[[File:Bioactive Terrarium Cleanup Crew.jpg|thumb|Isopods eating snake feces in a bioactive terrarium]]
Waste products of the primary species are consumed by a variety of smaller invertebrates, termed a "cleanup crew".  These can include [[Woodlouse|woodlice]], [[springtail]]s, [[earthworm]]s, [[millipede]]s, and various [[beetle]]s, with different species being preferred in different habitats - the cleanup crew for a tropical rainforest bioactive terrarium may rely primarily on springtails, isopods, and earthworms, while a desert habitat would use mostly beetles.  If the primary species is insectivorous, they may consume insects in the cleanup crew, and thus the cleanup crew must have sufficient retreats to avoid being completely depopulated.

Additionally, bioactive terraria typically have a flourishing population of bacteria and other microorganisms which break down the wastes of the cleanup crew and primary species.  Fungi may occur, and, if non-toxic, may provide food for the cleanup crew and primary species.

In [[maximum parsimony]], an '''informative site''' is a position in the relevant set of sequences at which there are at least two different [[character state]]s at that point in the sequences, and each of those states occurs in at least two of the sequences. Character states can take on multiple types of data, including [[Morphology_(biology)|morphological]] (such as the presence of wings, tentacles, etc.) or [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular information]] such as sequences of [[DNA]] or [[proteins]].
[[File:Parsimony informative v1.svg|thumb|Example of parsimony informative sites. In phylogenetics, parsimony informative sites are those with at least two states. Here, this is sites 2 and 4. Site 2 indicates a grouping of Species A and C, while site 4 indicates a grouping of Species A and B. Because these two sites conflict, other analyses (such as [[maximum likelihood]]) are needed to resolve the phylogenetic tree of these four species.]]

{{distinguish|Neonatology}}
&lt;!---Extant taxon is now a redirect here, so this article needs to be about that topic now too...---&gt;
'''Neontology''' is a part of [[biology]] that, in contrast to [[paleontology]], deals with living (or, more generally, ''[[Holocene|recent]]'') [[organisms]]. It is the study of '''extant taxa''' (singular: extant [[taxon]]): taxa (such as [[species]], [[genus|genera]] and [[family (biology)|families]]) with members still alive, as opposed to (all) being [[Extinction|extinct]]. For example:
* The [[moose]] (''Alces alces'') is an extant species, and the [[dodo]] (''Raphus cucullatus'') is an extinct species.
* In the group of [[mollusc]]s known as the [[cephalopod]]s, {{as of|1987|lc=y}} there were approximately 600 extant species and 7,500 extinct species.&lt;ref name="Essential"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential readings in evolutionary biology|others=Ayala, Francisco José, 1934-, Avise, John C.|isbn=978-1421413051|location=Baltimore|oclc=854285705|last1 = Ayala|first1 = Francisco J.|last2=Avise|first2=John C.|date=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A taxon can be classified as extinct if it is broadly agreed or certified that no members of the group are still alive. Conversely, an extinct taxon can be reclassified as extant if there are new discoveries of extant species ("[[Lazarus species]]"), or if previously-known extant species are reclassified as members of the taxon.

Most biologists, [[zoology|zoologists]], and [[botanist]]s are in practice neontologists, and the term neontologist is used largely by paleontologists referring to non-[[Paleontology|paleontologists]]. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] said of neontology:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All professions maintain their [[parochialism]]s, and I trust that nonpaleontological readers will forgive our major [[wikt:manifestation|manifestation]]. We are paleontologists, so we need a name to contrast ourselves with all you folks who study modern [[organisms]] in [[human]] or [[ecology|ecological]] [[time]]. You therefore become neontologists. We do recognize the unbalanced and parochial nature of this [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] division.&lt;ref name="Pattern"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pattern and Process in Cultural Evolution|last=Shennan|first=Stephan|publisher=University of California Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0520255999|location=|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neontological evolutionary biology has a temporal perspective between 100 and 1000 years. Neontology's fundamental basis relies on models of natural selection as well as speciation. Neontology's methods, when compared to evolutionary [[paleontology]], has a greater emphasis on experiments. There are more frequent discontinuities present in paleontology than in neontology, because paleontology involves extinct taxa. Neontology has organisms actually present and available to sample and perform research on.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt; Neontology's research method uses [[cladistics]] to examine [[morphology (biology)|morphologies]] and [[genetics]]. Neontology data has more emphasis on genetic data and the population structure than paleontology does.&lt;ref name="Pattern"/&gt;

==Information gaps==
When the scientific community accepted the [[synthetic theory of evolution]], [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomies]] became [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular evolutionary genetics|last=Masatoshi.|first=Nei|date=1987|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231063210|location=New York|oclc=13945914}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, information gaps arose within the fossil record of species- especially in Homo sapiens. The anthropologists who accepted the synthetic theory, reject the idea of an "ape-man" because the concept had mistaken paleontology with neontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of the history of science|others=Bynum, W. F. (William F.), 1943-, Browne, E. J. (E. Janet), 1950-, Porter, Roy, 1946-2002|isbn=978-0691614717|location=Princeton, New Jersey|oclc=889248984|last1 = Bynum|first1 = William F.|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An ape-man, in actuality, would be a [[primate]] with traits that would represent anything in between [[human]]s and the other [[Hominidae|great apes]]. If the concept of an ape-man was based on neontology, then our [[phenotype]] would resemble [[Bigfoot]]. Since the concept was based on paleontology, the idea of an ape-man could possibly be represented by the fossil hominids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creature of controversy : a candid look at the hidden world of Bigfoot research &amp; the men and women who hunt for a legend|last=A.|first=Shiel, Lisa|date=2011|publisher=Jacobsville Books|isbn=978-1934631423|location=Lake Linden, MI|oclc=818361503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extant taxa vs. extinct taxa==
Neontology studies '''extant''' (living) taxa and also recently extinct taxa, but declaring a taxon to be definitively extinct is difficult. Taxa that have previously been declared extinct may reappear over time. Species that were once considered extinct and then reappear unscathed are characterized by the term "the Lazarus effect", or are also called a [[Lazarus species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://biogeosciences.u-bourgogne.fr/documents/articles_pdf/2001_Fara_GeolJ.pdf|title=What are Lazarus taxa?|last=Fara|first=Emmanuel|date=19 April 2000|access-date=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a study determined that 36% of supposed mammalian extinction had been proven, while the other 64% had insufficient evidence to be declared extinct or had been rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Extinctions in near time : causes, contexts, and consequences|others=MacPhee, R.

==Neontology importance==
Neontology's fundamental theories rely on biological models of [[natural selection]] and speciation that connect genes, the unit of heredity with the mechanism of evolution by natural selection.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} For example, researchers utilized neontological and paleontological datasets to study nonhuman primate dentitions compared with human dentitions. In order to understand the underlying genetic mechanisms that influence this variation between nonhuman primates and humans, neontological methods are applied to the research method. By incorporating neontology with different biological research methods, it can become clear how genetic mechanisms underlie major events in things such as primate evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grieco|first=Theresa M.|last2=Rizk|first2=Oliver T.|last3=Hlusko|first3=Leslea J.|date=2012-09-07|title=Data from: A modular framework characterizes micro- and macroevolution of Old World monkey dentitions|chapter-url=http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.693j8|doi=10.5061/dryad.693j8|type=Data Set|publisher=Dryad Digital Repository|chapter=Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadal, ''The SAGE Encyclopedia of Psychology and Gender'' (2017, {{ISBN|1483384276}}), page 401: "Most cultures currently construct their societies based on the understanding of gender binary—the two gender categorizations (male and female). Such societies divide their population based on biological sex assigned to individuals at birth to begin the process of gender socialization."&lt;/ref&gt; those who exist outside these groups fall under the umbrella term [[Non-binary gender|''non-binary'' or ''genderqueer'']]. Some societies have specific genders besides "man" and "woman", such as the [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijras]] of [[South Asia]]; these are often referred to as ''[[third gender]]s'' (and ''fourth genders'', etc).

[[Sexology|Sexologist]] [[John Money]] introduced the terminological distinction between [[Sex and gender distinction|biological sex and gender as a role]] in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word ''gender'' to refer to anything but [[grammatical gender|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name=udry /&gt;&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt; However, Money's meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s, when [[feminist theory]] embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the [[Social construction of gender difference|social construct of gender]]. Today, the distinction is followed in some contexts, especially the social sciences&lt;ref name="socialsciencedictionary"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.socialsciencedictionary.com/GENDER| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202125938/http://www.socialsciencedictionary.com/GENDER| url-status=dead| archive-date=2 February 2011| title=GENDER| publisher=Social Science Dictionary| accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pearsonhighered"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender Roles: A Sociological Perspective|author=Lindsey, Linda L.|isbn=978-0-13-244830-7|year=2010|publisher=Pearson|chapter=Ch. 1.

In other contexts, including some areas of the social sciences, ''gender'' includes ''sex'' or replaces it.&lt;ref name="udry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt; For instance, in non-human animal research, ''gender'' is commonly used to refer to the biological sex of the animals.&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt; This [[Semantic change|change in the meaning]] of gender can be traced to the 1980s. In 1993, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) started to use ''gender'' instead of ''sex''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126835.pdf|title=Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs|access-date=3 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406164205/https://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM126835.pdf|archive-date=6 April 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 2011, the FDA reversed its position and began using ''sex ''as the biological classification and ''gender'' as "a person's self representation as male or female, or how that person is responded to by social institutions based on the individual's gender presentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm283453.htm|title=Evaluation of Sex-Specific Data in Medical Device Clinical Studies – Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff|last=|first=|date=22 August 2014|website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |accessdate=26 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[social science]]s have a branch devoted to [[gender studies]]. Other sciences, such as [[sexology]] and [[neuroscience]], are also interested in the subject. The social sciences sometimes approach gender as a [[Social constructionism|social construct]], and gender studies particularly do, while research in the [[natural science]]s investigates whether [[sex differences in humans|biological differences]] in males and females influence the development of gender in humans; both inform debate about how far biological differences influence the formation of gender identity. In some English literature, there is also a trichotomy between biological sex, psychological gender, and social gender role. This framework first appeared in a feminist paper on [[transsexualism]] in 1978.&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1978|title=Transsexualism and women: A critical perspective|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=4|issue=3|pages=97–106|doi=10.2307/3177542|jstor=3177542|author=Yudkin, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and usage ==

=== Derivation ===

The modern English word ''gender'' comes from the [[Middle English]] ''gender'', ''gendre'', a [[loanword]] from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] and [[Middle French]] ''gendre''. This, in turn, came from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:genus#Latin|genus]]''. Both words mean "kind", "type", or "sort". They derive ultimately from a widely attested [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) [[Root (linguistics)|root]] ''g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;n-'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Pokorny|Pokorny, Julius]] (1959, reprinted in 1989) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071113165848/http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=leiden&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=%5Cdata%5Cie%5Cpokorny&amp;first=651 'gen'], in ''Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'', Bern: Francke, pp. 373–375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE143.html 'gen&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;-'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704184247/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE143.html |date=4 July 2007 }}, in 'Appendix I: Indo-European Roots', to ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', Fourth Edition, (Boston: [[Houghton Mifflin]] Company, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
which is also the source of ''kin'', ''kind'', ''king'', and many other English words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/roots/zzg00600.html 'Gen']. Your Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; It appears in Modern [[French language|French]] in the word ''[[genre]]'' (type, kind, also ''[[:fr:genre sexuel|genre sexuel]]'') and is related to the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ''gen-'' (to produce), appearing in ''[[gene]]'', ''[[wikt:genesis|genesis]]'', and ''[[oxygen]]''. The ''Oxford Etymological Dictionary of the English Language'' of 1882 defined ''gender'' as ''kind, breed, sex'', derived from the Latin ablative case of ''genus'', like ''genere natus'', which refers to birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00skeauoft/page/n5|title=An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language|last=Skeat|first=Walter William|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1882|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED1, Volume 4, 1900) notes the original meaning of ''gender'' as "kind" had already become obsolete.

=== History of the concept ===

The concept of gender, in the modern sense, is a recent invention in human history.&lt;ref name="holmes antiquity" /&gt; The ancient world had no basis of understanding gender as it has been understood in the humanities and social sciences for the past few decades.&lt;ref name="holmes antiquity"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holmes |first1=Brooke |title=Gender : Antiquity and its Legacy |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195380828 |pages=1–2 |chapter=Introduction |quote=For as it turns out, what we call gender is a fairly recent concept. It's not that people in Ancient Greece and Rome didn't talk and think and argue about the categories of male and female, masculine and feminine and the nature and extent of sexual difference. They did in [ways] both similar to and very different from our own. The problem is that they didn't have the concept of gender that has grown so influential in the humanities and the social sciences over the past four decades.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''gender'' had been associated with grammar for most of history and only started to move towards it being a malleable cultural construct in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="holmes antiquity2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holmes |first1=Brooke |title=Gender : Antiquity and its Legacy |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195380828 |pages=3–4 |chapter=Introduction |quote=The concept of gender, as I've just said, is recent. So what is it and where does it come from? Simone de Beauvoir famously wrote: 'one is not born, but rather becomes, woman'...But the term 'gender', which had long been associated with grammar, only started to move towards what she was describing in the later 1950s and 1960s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Sexology|Sexologist]] [[John Money]] introduced the terminological distinction between [[Sex and gender distinction|biological sex and gender as a role]] in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word ''gender'' to refer to anything but [[grammatical gender|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name=udry /&gt;&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt; For example, in a bibliography of 12,000 references on marriage and family from 1900–1964, the term ''gender'' does not even emerge once.&lt;ref name=udry /&gt; Analysis of more than 30 million academic article titles from 1945–2001 showed that the uses of the term ''"gender"'', were much rarer than uses of ''"sex"'', was often used as a grammatical category early in this period. By the end of this period, uses of ''"gender"'' outnumbered uses of ''"sex"'' in the social sciences, arts, and humanities.&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt; It was in the 1970s that feminist scholars adopted the term ''gender'' as way of distinguishing “socially constructed” aspects of male–female differences (gender) from “biologically determined” aspects (sex).&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt;

In the last two decades of the 20th century, the use of ''gender'' in academia has increased greatly, outnumbering uses of ''sex'' in the social sciences. While the spread of the word in science publications can be attributed to the influence of feminism, its use as a synonym for sex is attributed to the failure to grasp the distinction made in feminist theory, and the distinction has sometimes become blurred with the theory itself; [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]] stated, "Among the reasons that working scientists have given me for choosing gender rather than sex in biological contexts are desires to signal sympathy with feminist goals, to use a more academic term, or to avoid the connotation of copulation."&lt;ref name="haig" /&gt;

In legal cases alleging [[discrimination]], ''sex'' is usually preferred as the determining factor rather than ''gender'' as it refers to biology rather than socially constructed [[norm (sociology)|norms]] which are more open to interpretation and dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Render, Meredith. (2006) "Misogyny, Androgyny, and Sexual Harassment: Sex Discrimination in a Gender-Deconstructed World". ''Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender''. Vol. 29(1) (Winter). pp. 99–150.&lt;/ref&gt; Julie Greenberg writes that although gender and sex are separate concepts, they are interlinked in that [[gender discrimination]] often results from [[gender stereotype|stereotype]]s based on what is expected of members of each sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greenberg | first1 = Julie A | year = 1999 | title = Defining Male and Female: Intersexuality and the Collision Between Law and Biology | url = | journal = Arizona Law Review | volume = 41 | issue = | page = 265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B.]]'', United States Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote:

{{quote|The word ‘gender’ has acquired the new and useful connotation of cultural or attitudinal characteristics (as opposed to physical characteristics) distinctive to the sexes. That is to say, gender is to sex as feminine is to female and masculine is to male.&lt;ref&gt;''J.E.B. v. Ala. ex rel. T.B.'', 114 S. Ct. 1419, 1436 n.1 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== As a grammatical category ====

The word was still widely used, however, in the specific sense of [[grammatical gender]] (the assignment of nouns to categories such as ''masculine'', ''feminine'' and ''neuter''). According to [[Aristotle]], this concept was introduced by the Greek philosopher [[Protagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rhetoric |author=Aristotle |authorlink=Aristotle |translator-last=Roberts |translator-first=William Rhys |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_IMCohto0YC&amp;pg=PA127 |date=2004 |orig-year=1st pub. [[Modern Library]] NY, 1954 |publisher=[[Dover Publications|Dover]] |location=Mineola, NY |isbn=978-0-486-43793-4 |oclc=55616891 |quote=A fourth rule is to observe Protagoras' classification of nouns into male, female and inanimate.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1926, [[Henry Watson Fowler]] stated that the definition of the word pertained to this grammar-related meaning: {{quote|"Gender...is a grammatical term only. To talk of persons...of the masculine or feminine g[ender], meaning of the male or female sex, is either a jocularity (permissible or not according to context) or a blunder."&lt;ref&gt;[[Fowler's Modern English Usage]], 1926: p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== As a social role ====

Sexologist [[John Money]] coined the term ''gender role'', and was the first to use it in print in a scientific trade journal.  In a seminal 1955 paper he defined it as "all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman."&lt;ref name="Basic-Concepts"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Money |first=John |authorlink1=John Money |last2=Hampson |first2=Joan G |last3=Hampson |first3=John |date=October 1955 |title=An Examination of Some Basic Sexual Concepts: The Evidence of Human Hermaphroditism |journal=Bull.

The popular use of ''gender'' simply as an alternative to ''sex'' (as a biological category) is also widespread, although attempts are still made to preserve the distinction. The ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]]'' (2000) uses the following two sentences to illustrate the difference, noting that the distinction "is useful in principle, but it is by no means widely observed, and considerable variation in usage occurs at all levels."&lt;ref name="difference"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/59/G0075900.html Usage note: ''Gender'',] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321144225/http://bartleby.com/61/59/G0075900.html |date=21 March 2006 }} ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sebastian Berggren 1999 for Wild Side Story.jpg|thumb|upright|Gender depicted as an ambiguous phenomenon, by a young Swedish actor]]
''Gender identity'' refers to a personal identification with a particular gender and gender role in society. The term ''[[woman]]'' has historically been used interchangeably with reference to the female body, though more recently this usage has been viewed as controversial by some [[feminist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mikkola, Mari (12 May 2008). [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2012/entries/feminism-gender "Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender."] Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;There are qualitative analyses that explore and present the representations of gender; however, [[feminist]]s challenge these dominant ideologies concerning gender roles and biological sex. One's biological sex is directly tied to specific social roles and the expectations. [[Judith Butler]] considers the concept of being a woman to have more challenges, owing not only to society's viewing women as a social category but also as a felt sense of self, a culturally conditioned or constructed subjective identity.&lt;ref name="Butler 1990"&gt;Butler (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Social identity'' refers to the common identification with a collectivity or social category that creates a common culture among participants concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D.A. and Oliver, P.E.

Categorizing males and females into [[social role]]s creates a problem, because individuals feel they have to be at one end of a linear spectrum and must identify themselves as man or woman, rather than being allowed to choose a section in between.&lt;ref&gt;Pathak, Sunita, and Pathak, Surendra [https://www.academia.edu/263120/Gender_and_the_MDGs_with_reference_to_women_as_human "Gender and the MDGs with Reference to Women as Human"].

Pine Forge Press. 3rd edition&lt;/ref&gt; Social roles of men and women in relation to each other is based on the cultural norms of that society, which lead to the creation of [[gender systems]].

Philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] said that as sexual subjects, humans are the object of power, which is not an institution or structure, rather it is a signifier or name attributed to "complex strategical situation".&lt;ref&gt;Tong, Rosemarie (2009). Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction / Rosemarie Tong.Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press {{ISBN|0-8133-4375-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, "power" is what determines individual attributes, behaviors, etc. and people are a part of an ontologically and epistemologically constructed set of names and labels. For example, being female characterizes one as a woman, and being a woman signifies one as weak, emotional, and irrational, and incapable of actions attributed to a "man". Butler said that gender and sex are more like verbs than nouns. She reasoned that her actions are limited because she is female. "I am not permitted to construct my gender and sex willy-nilly," she said.&lt;ref name="Butler 1990" /&gt; "[This] is so because gender is politically and therefore socially controlled. Rather than 'woman' being something one is, it is something one does."&lt;ref name="Butler 1990" /&gt; More recent criticisms of Judith Butler's theories critique her writing for reinforcing the very conventional dichotomies of gender.&lt;ref&gt;Vigo, Julian.

=== Social assignment and gender fluidity ===
{{See also|Sex assignment}}
According to [[gender studies|gender theorist]] [[Kate Bornstein]], gender can have ambiguity and fluidity.&lt;ref&gt;Bornstein, Kate (1995). ''Gender Outlaw – On Men, Women and the rest of us'', Vintage, {{ISBN|0-679-75701-5}} pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; There are two contrasting ideas regarding the definition of gender, and the intersection of both of them is definable as below:

The [[World Health Organization]] defines gender as the result of socially constructed ideas about the behavior, actions, and roles a particular sex performs.&lt;ref name="www.who.int" /&gt; The beliefs, values and attitude taken up and exhibited by them is as per the agreeable norms of the society and the personal opinions of the person is not taken into the primary consideration of assignment of gender and imposition of gender roles as per the assigned gender.&lt;ref name="www.who.int" /&gt; Intersections and crossing of the prescribed boundaries have no place in the arena of the social construct of the term "gender".

The assignment of gender involves taking into account the physiological and biological attributes assigned by nature followed by the imposition of the socially constructed conduct. ''Gender'' is a term used to exemplify the attributes that a society or culture constitutes as "masculine" or "feminine". Although a person's sex as male or female stands as a biological fact that is identical in any culture, what that specific sex means in reference to a person's gender role as a woman or a man in society varies cross culturally according to what things are considered to be masculine or feminine.&lt;ref name="Birke, Lynda 2001"&gt;Birke, Lynda (2001). "Chapter 24, In Pursuit of Difference." ''The Gender and Science Reader''. New York: Routledge, pp. 309–22.&lt;/ref&gt; These roles are learned from various, intersecting sources such as parental influences, the socialization a child receives in school, and what is portrayed in the local media. Learning gender roles starts from birth and includes seemingly simple things like what color outfits a baby is clothed in or what toys they are given to play with. However, a person's gender does not always align with what has been assigned at birth. Factors other than learned behaviors play a role in the development of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ehrensaft|first=Diane|date=25 May 2017|title=Gender nonconforming youth: current perspectives|journal=Adolescent Health, Medicine and Therapeutics|language=English|volume= 8|pages=57–67|doi=10.2147/ahmt.s110859|issn=1179-318X|pmc=5448699|pmid=28579848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to taxonomic approaches, some feminist philosophers have argued that gender "is a vast orchestration of subtle mediations between oneself and others", rather than a "private cause behind manifest behaviours".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Laurie|first=Timothy|title=The Ethics of Nobody I Know: Gender and the Politics of Description|url=https://www.academia.edu/6262250|year=2014|journal=Qualitative Research Journal|volume=14|issue=1|pages=64–78|doi=10.1108/qrj-03-2014-0011|hdl=10453/44221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Non-binary and third genders ====
{{main|Genderqueer|Third gender}}
Historically, many if not most societies have recognized only two distinct, broad classes of gender roles, a [[gender binary|binary]] of masculine and feminine, largely corresponding to the biological sexes of male and female.&lt;ref name="Nadal-re-binary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Llorente-re-binary"&gt;Maria Llorente, ''Culture, Heritage, and Diversity in Older Adult Mental Health Care'' (2018, {{ISBN|1615372059 }}), page 184: "Historically, in many, if not most, cultures, gender traditionally has been conceived as binary, but the modern and preferred understanding is that gender actually occurs on a spectrum."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie L. Miville, Angela D. Ferguson, ''Handbook of Race-Ethnicity and Gender in Psychology'' (2014, {{ISBN|1461488605}}), page 47: "In Western societies, as in many regions of the world, gender has been historically conceptualized and constructed as a binary (being either "male" or "female") largely determined by both biological (genetic and hormonal) and social cognitive (social, cultural reinforcement, and modeling of gendered behaviour)."&lt;/ref&gt; When a baby is born, society allocates the child to one gender or the other, on the basis of what their genitals resemble.&lt;ref name="Birke, Lynda 2001" /&gt; 

However, some societies have historically acknowledged and even honored people who fulfill a gender role that exists more in the middle of the continuum between the feminine and masculine polarity. For example, the Hawaiian [[māhū]],  who occupy "a place in the middle" between male and female,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://tedxmaui.com/hinaleimoana-wong-kalu/|title = Hinaleimoana Wong-Kalu – TedxMaui|date = 27 May 2014|accessdate = |website = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue6/matzner.html|title = Intersections: Transgender, Queens, Mahu, Whatever': An Oral History from Hawai'i|date = |accessdate = |website = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] ''ikwekaazo'', "men who choose to function as women",&lt;ref name=Treur2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Treuer|first1=Anton|editor1-last=|editor1-first=|title= The Assassination of Hole in the Day|date=2011|publisher=Borealis Books|location=|isbn=|page=|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1aIrg3wiUyoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q=ininiikaazo%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 October 2016|chapter=Women and Gender}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''ininiikaazo'', "women who function as men".&lt;ref name=Treur2011/&gt; In the language of the [[sociology of gender]], some of these people may be considered [[third gender]], especially by those in gender studies or anthropology.

In addition to these traditionally recognized third genders, many cultures now recognize, to differing degrees, various [[genderqueer|non-binary gender identities]]. People who are non-binary (or genderqueer) have gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine. They may identify as having an overlap of gender identities, having two or more genders, having no gender, having a fluctuating gender identity, or being third gender or other-gendered. Recognition of non-binary genders is still somewhat new to mainstream Western culture,&lt;ref&gt;McGee, R. Jon and Richard L. Warms (2011). Anthropological Theory: An Introductory History.

=== Measurement of gender identity ===
Early gender identity research hypothesized a single bipolar dimension of masculinity-femininity, with masculinity and femininity being opposites on one continuum. Assumptions of the unidimensional model were challenged as societal stereotypes changed, which led to the development of a two-dimensional gender identity model. In the model, masculinity and femininity were conceptualized as two separate and orthogonal dimensions, coexisting in varying degrees within an individual. This conceptualization on femininity and masculinity remains the accepted standard today.&lt;ref name=palan /&gt;

Two instruments incorporating the multidimensional nature of masculinity and femininity have dominated gender identity research: The Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) and the [[Personal Attributes Questionnaire]] (PAQ). Both instruments categorize individuals as either being sex typed (males report themselves as identifying primarily with masculine traits, females report themselves as identifying primarily with feminine traits), cross sex-typed (males report themselves as identifying primarily with feminine traits, females report themselves as identifying primarily with masculine traits), [[Androgyny|androgynous]] (either males or females who report themselves as high on both masculine and feminine traits) or undifferentiated (either males or females who report themselves as low on both masculine and feminine traits).&lt;ref name=palan&gt;{{cite journal|author=Palan, K. |year=2001 |url=http://www.amsreview.org/articles/palan10-2001.pdf |title=Gender Identity in Consumer Research: A Literature Review and Research Agenda |journal=Academy of Marketing Science Review |volume=10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911204513/http://www.amsreview.org/articles/palan10-2001.pdf |archivedate=11 September 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenge (1997) noted that men are generally more masculine than women and women generally more feminine than men, but the association between biological sex and masculinity/femininity is waning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1997|title=Changes in masculine and feminine traits over time: A meta-analysis|journal=Sex Roles|volume=36|issue=5–6|pages=305–325|doi=10.1007/BF02766650|last1=Twenge|first1=Jean M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist theory and gender studies ===
{{Feminist philosophy sidebar}}
Biologist and feminist academic [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] rejects the discourse of biological versus social determinism and advocates a deeper analysis of how interactions between the biological being and the social environment influence individuals' capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fausto-Sterling (1992) ''Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about Men and Women''. New York: Basic Books. p. 8 {{ISBN|0-465-04792-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher and feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]] applied [[existentialism]] to women's experience of life: "One is not born a woman, one becomes one."&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir, Simone (1949) ''The Second Sex''."&lt;/ref&gt; In context, this is a philosophical statement. However, it may be analyzed in terms of biology—a girl must pass [[puberty]] to become a woman—and sociology, as a great deal of mature relating in social contexts is learned rather than instinctive.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000) Chapter 3 "Of Gender and Genitals", pp. 44–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[feminist theory]], terminology for gender issues developed over the 1970s. In the 1974 edition of ''Masculine/Feminine or Human'', the author uses "innate gender" and "learned sex roles",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Chafetz, J.S. | title=Masculine/Feminine or Human? An Overview of the Sociology of Sex Roles | location=Itasca, Illinois | publisher=F.E. Peacock | year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the 1978 edition, the use of ''sex'' and ''gender'' is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Chafetz, J.S. | title=Masculine/Feminine or Human?

By 1980, most feminist writings had agreed on using ''gender'' only for socioculturally adapted [[trait theory|traits]].

In [[gender studies]] the term ''gender'' refers to proposed social and cultural constructions of masculinities and femininities. In this context, ''gender'' explicitly excludes reference to biological differences, to focus on cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Stephanie (1992). [https://books.google.com/books?id=WMoNAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Gender''], Routledge, p. vii {{ISBN|0-422-60570-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This emerged from a number of different areas: in sociology during the 1950s; from the theories of the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan#Lacan and his discontents|Jacques Lacan]]; and in the work of French psychoanalysts like [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Luce Irigaray]], and American feminists such as [[Judith Butler]]. Those who followed Butler came to regard gender roles as a practice, sometimes referred to as "[[performative]]".&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1990) p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles E. Hurst states that some people think sex will, "...automatically determine one's gender demeanor and role (social) as well as one's [[sexual orientation]] (sexual attractions and behavior).&lt;ref name="Hurst141" /&gt; Gender sociologists believe that people have [[cultural]] origins and habits for dealing with gender. For example, Michael Schwalbe believes that humans must be taught how to act appropriately in their designated gender to fill the role properly, and that the way people behave as masculine or feminine interacts with social expectations. Schwalbe comments that humans "are the results of many people embracing and acting on similar ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Schwalbe, M. (2005). The Sociologically Examined Life: Pieces of the Conversation Third Edition.  pp. 22–23 {{ISBN|0-07-282579-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; People do this through everything from [[clothing]] and hairstyle to relationship and employment choices. Schwalbe believes that these distinctions are important, because society wants to identify and categorize people as soon as we see them. They need to place people into distinct categories to know how we should feel about them.

Hurst comments that in a society where we present our genders so distinctly, there can often be severe consequences for breaking these cultural norms. Many of these consequences are rooted in [[discrimination]] based on sexual orientation. Gays and lesbians are often discriminated against in our legal system because of societal prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, N. and Stanley, E. (2011). Captive Genders. 1st ed. Edinburgh: AK Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Center for American Progress, (2016). Unjust: How The Broken Criminal Justice System Fails LGBT People. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lydon et al., "Coming Out of Concrete Closets: A Report on Black &amp; Pink's National LGBTQ Prisoner Survey."&lt;/ref&gt;  Hurst describes how this discrimination works against people for breaking gender norms, no matter what their sexual orientation is. He says that "courts often confuse sex, gender, and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex".&lt;ref name="Hurst141"&gt;Hurst, C. (2007) ''Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences''. 6th Edition. pp. 131, 139–142&lt;/ref&gt; This prejudice plays out in our legal system when a person is judged differently because they do not present themselves as the "correct" gender.

[[Andrea Dworkin]] stated her "commitment to destroying male dominance and gender itself" while stating her belief in [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Andrea (1995). "My Life as a Writer", pp.&amp;nbsp;33–34 in Dworkin, Andrea ''Life and Death: Unapologetic Writings on the Continuing War Against Women''. New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|0-7432-3626-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist [[Mary Hawkesworth]] addresses gender and feminist theory, stating that since the 1970s the concept of gender has transformed and been used in significantly different ways within feminist scholarship. She notes that a transition occurred when several feminist scholars, such as [[Sandra Harding]] and [[Joan Wallach Scott|Joan Scott]], began to conceive of gender "as an analytic category within which humans think about and organize their social activity". Feminist scholars in [[Political Science]] began employing gender as an analytical category, which highlighted "social and political relations neglected by mainstream accounts". However, Hawkesworth states "feminist political science has not become a dominant paradigm within the discipline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hawkesworth|first=Mary|year=2005|title=Engendering political science: An immodest proposal|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|volume=1|issue=1|pages=141–156|doi=10.1017/s1743923x0523101x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American political scientist Karen Beckwith addresses the concept of gender within political science arguing that a "common language of gender" exists and that it must be explicitly articulated in order to build upon it within the political science discipline. Beckwith describes two ways in which the political scientist may employ 'gender' when conducting empirical research: "gender as a category and as a process." Employing gender as a category allows for political scientists "to delineate specific contexts where behaviours, actions, attitudes and preferences considered masculine or feminine result in particular" political outcomes. It may also demonstrate how gender differences, not necessarily corresponding precisely with sex, may "constrain or facilitate political" actors. Gender as a process has two central manifestations in political science research, firstly in determining "the differential effects of structures and policies upon men and women," and secondly, the ways in which masculine and feminine political actors "actively work to produce favorable gendered outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karen|first=Beckwith|title=A Common Language of Gender?|journal=Politics &amp; Gender|year=2005|volume=1|issue=1|page=132|doi=10.1017/s1743923x05211017|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bb784fb6ccf6126c87f44196e5aebe5ecee124a9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to gender studies, Jacquetta Newman states that although sex is determined biologically, the ways in which people express gender is not. Gendering is a socially constructed process based on culture, though often cultural expectations around women and men have a direct relationship to their biology.  Because of this, Newman argues, many privilege sex as being a cause of oppression and ignore other issues like race, ability, poverty, etc. Current gender studies classes seek to move away from that and examine the intersectionality of these factors in determining people's lives. She also points out that other non-Western cultures do not necessarily have the same views of gender and gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women, 2nd ed|last=White|first=Linda|publisher=Oxford Press|year=1964|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman also debates the meaning of equality, which is often considered the goal of feminism; she believes that ''equality'' is a problematic term because it can mean many different things, such as people being treated identically, differently, or fairly based on their gender. Newman believes this is problematic because there is no unified definition as to what equality means or looks like, and that this can be significantly important in areas like public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Politics, and Public Policy: The Political Struggles of Canadian Women, 2nd ed|last=White|first=Linda|publisher=Oxford Press|year=1964|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social construction of sex hypotheses ===
{{See also|Sex and gender distinction}}
[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|"[[Rosie the Riveter]]" was an iconic symbol of the American [[Home front during World War II|homefront]] in [[World War II|WWII]] and a departure from restrictive, "feminine", [[gender role]]s due to [[Total war|wartime necessity]].]]
Sociologists generally regard gender as a social construct, and various researchers, including many [[Feminism|feminists]], consider sex to only be a matter of biology and something that is not about social or cultural construction. For instance, [[Sexology|sexologist]] [[John Money]] suggests the distinction between biological sex and gender as a role.&lt;ref name=j1 /&gt; Moreover, [[Ann Oakley]], a professor of sociology and social policy, says "the constancy of sex must be admitted, but so also must the variability of gender."&lt;ref&gt;Oakley, Ann (1972). ''Sex, Gender and Society''. London: Temple Smith. p. 16 {{ISBN|0-85117-020-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] states, "'[s]ex' refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women," and "'gender' refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women."&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (2002). "[http://www.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/ Gender and Reproductive Rights: Working Definitions]". Retrieved 15 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, sex is regarded as a category studied in biology (natural sciences), while gender is studied in [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. Lynda Birke, a feminist biologist, maintains "'biology' is not seen as something which might change."&lt;ref&gt;Birke, Lynda (2001). "In Pursuit of Difference: Scientific Studies of Women and Men," Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch eds., ''The Gender and Science Reader'', New York: Routledge. p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is stated that sex is something that does not change, while gender can change according to social structure.

However, there are scholars who argue that sex is also socially constructed. For example, gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] states that "perhaps this construct called 'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed, perhaps it was always already gender, with the consequence that the distinction between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all."&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1990) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
She continues:&lt;blockquote&gt;It would make no sense, then, to define gender as the cultural interpretation of sex, if sex is itself a gender-centered category. Gender should not be conceived merely as the cultural inscription of meaning based on a given sex (a juridical conception); gender must also designate the very apparatus of production whereby the sexes themselves are established. [...] This production of sex as the pre-discursive should be understood as the effect of the apparatus of cultural construction designated by gender.&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1990) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Butler argues that "bodies only appear, only endure, only live within the productive constraints of certain highly gendered regulatory schemas,"&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1993) p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; and sex is "no longer as a bodily given on which the construct of gender is artificially imposed, but as a cultural norm which governs the materialization of bodies."&lt;ref&gt;Butler (1993) pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Marria Lugones states that, among the [[Yoruba people]], there was no concept of gender and no gender system at all before [[colonialism]]. She argues that colonial powers used a gender system as a tool for domination and fundamentally changing social relations among the indigenous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lugones|first=María|date=Winter 2008|title=Heterosexualism and the Colonial/Modern Gender System|journal=Hypatia|volume=22|issue=1|pages=196–198|doi=10.1353/hyp.2006.0067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to history, Linda Nicholson, a professor of history and [[women's studies]], points out that the understanding of human bodies as sexually dimorphic was historically not recognised. She argues that male and female genitals were considered inherently the same in Western society until the 18th century. At that time, female genitals were regarded as incomplete male genitals, and the difference between the two was conceived as a matter of degree. In other words, there was a belief in a gradation of physical forms, or a spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1994 |title="Interpreting Gender". Signs |journal=Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=79–105 |doi=10.1086/494955 |jstor=3174928 |author=Nicholson, Linda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, drawing from the empirical research of [[intersex]] children, [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], a professor of biology and [[gender studies]], describes how the doctors address the issues of intersexuality. She starts her argument with an example of the birth of an intersexual individual and maintains "our conceptions of the nature of gender difference shape, even as they reflect, the ways we structure our social system and polity; they also shape and reflect our understanding of our physical bodies."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000) p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Then she adds how gender assumptions affects the scientific study of sex by presenting the research of intersexuals by John Money et al., and she concludes that "they never questioned the fundamental assumption that there are only two sexes, because their goal in studying intersexuals was to find out more about 'normal' development."&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000) p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; She also mentions the language the doctors use when they talk with the parents of the intersexuals. After describing how the doctors inform parents about the intersexuality, she asserts that because the doctors believe that the intersexuals are actually male or female, they tell the parents of the intersexuals that it will take a little bit more time for the doctors to determine whether the infant is a boy or a girl. That is to say, the doctors' behavior is formulated by the cultural gender assumption that there are only two sexes. Lastly, she maintains that the differences in the ways in which the medical professionals in different regions treat intersexual people also give us a good example of how sex is socially constructed.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000"&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In her ''Sexing the body: gender politics and the construction of sexuality'', she introduces the following example:&lt;blockquote&gt; A group of physicians from Saudi Arabia recently reported on several cases of XX intersex children with [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] (CAH), a genetically inherited malfunction of the [[enzyme]]s that aid in making [[steroid hormones]]. [...] In the United States and Europe, such children, because they have the potential to bear children later in life, are usually raised as girls. Saudi doctors trained in this European tradition recommended such a course of action to the Saudi parents of CAH XX children. A number of parents, however, refused to accept the recommendation that their child, initially identified as a son, be raised instead as a daughter. Nor would they accept feminizing surgery for their child. [...] This was essentially an expression of local community attitudes with [...] the preference for male offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Fausto-Sterling (2000) pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus it is evident that culture can play a part in assigning gender, particularly in relation to intersex children.&lt;ref name="Fausto-Sterling, Anne 2000" /&gt;

Another work of Ann Fausto-Sterling's in which she discusses gender is ''The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough.'' In this article, Fausto-Sterling states that Western culture has only two sexes and that even their language restricts the presence of more than two sexes. She argues that instead of having a binomial nomenclature for organizing humans into two distinct sexes (male and female), there are at least five sexes in the broad spectrum of gender. These five sexes include male, female, hermaphrodite, female [[pseudohermaphrodites]] (individuals who have ovaries and some male genitalia but lack testes), and male pseudohermaphrodites (individuals who have testes and some female genitalia but lack ovaries). Fausto-Sterling additionally adds that in the category of hermaphrodites, there are additional degrees and levels in which the genitalia are developed; this means that there may be more intersexes that exist in this continuum of gender.

Fausto-Sterling argues that gender has been gradually institutionally disciplined into a binary system through medical advances. She brings up multiple instances where gender in history was not split into strictly male or female, and states that, by the end of the Middle Age, intersex individuals were forced to pick a side in the binary gender code and to adhere by it. She adds on that "hermaphrodites have unruly bodies" and they need to fit into society's definition of gender.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ridgeway|first1=Cecilia L.|last2=Correll|first2=Shelley J.|title=Unpacking the Gender System: A Theoretical Perspective on Gender Beliefs and Social Relations|jstor=4149448|volume=18|issue=4|pages=510–531|doi=10.1177/0891243204265269|journal=Gender|year=2004|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/79e0fe06525986e9c95defb495e8c8701b27aa8b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, modern-day parents have been urged by medical doctors to decide the sex for their hermaphroditic child immediately after childbirth. She emphasizes that the role of the medical community is that of an institutionalized discipline on society that there can only be two sexes: male and female and only the two listed are considered "normal." Lastly, Fausto-Sterling argues that modern laws require humans to be labelled either as male or female and that "ironically, a more sophisticated knowledge of the complexity of sexual systems has led to the repression of such intricacy."&lt;ref name="jstor.org" /&gt; She mentions this quote to inform the prevailing thought that hermaphrodites, without medical intervention, are assumed to live a life full of psychological pain when in fact, there is no evidence in which that is the case. She finishes up her argument asking what would happen if society started accepting intersex individuals.

The article ''Adolescent Gender-Role Identity and Mental Health: Gender Intensification Revisited'' focuses on the work of Heather A. Priess, Sara M. Lindberg, and [[Janet Shibley Hyde]] on whether or not girls and boys diverge in their gender identities during adolescent years. The researchers based their work on ideas previously mentioned by Hill and Lynch in their gender intensification hypothesis in that signals and messages from parents determine and affect their children's [[gender role]] identities. This hypothesis argues that parents affect their children's gender role identities and that different interactions spent with either parents will affect gender intensification. Priess and among other's study did not support the hypothesis of Hill and Lynch which stated "that as adolescents experience these and other socializing influences, they will become more stereotypical in their gender-role identities and gendered attitudes and behaviors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Priess|first1=Heather A.|last2=Lindberg|first2=Sara M.|last3=Hyde|first3=Janet Shibley|title=Adolescent Gender-Role Identity and Mental Health: Gender Intensification Revisited|jstor=25592088|volume=80|issue=5|pages=1531–1544|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01349.x|journal=Child Development|pmc=4244905|pmid=19765016|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the researchers did state that perhaps the hypothesis Hill and Lynch proposed was true in the past but is not true now due to changes in the population of teens in respect to their gender-role identities.

Authors of ''Unpacking the Gender System: A Theoretical Perspective on Gender Belief’s and Social Relations'', Cecilia Ridgeway and Shelley Correll, argue that gender is more than an identity or role but is something that is institutionalized through "social relational contexts." Ridgeway and Correll define "social relational contexts" as "any situation in which individuals define themselves in relation to others in order to act."&lt;ref name="Wiley"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ridgeway|first1=Cecilia L.|last2=Correll|first2=Shelley J.|title=Unpacking the Gender System: A Theoretical Perspective on Gender Beliefs and Social Relations|jstor=4149448|volume=18|issue=4|pages=510–531|doi=10.1177/0891243204265269|journal=Gender|year=2004|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/79e0fe06525986e9c95defb495e8c8701b27aa8b}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also point out that in addition to social relational contexts, cultural beliefs plays a role in the gender system. The coauthors argue that daily people are forced to acknowledge and interact with others in ways that are related to gender. Every day, individuals are interacting with each other and comply with society's set standard of [[hegemonic]] beliefs, which includes gender roles. They state that society's hegemonic cultural beliefs sets the rules which in turn create the setting for which social relational contexts are to take place. Ridgeway and Correll then shift their topic towards sex categorization. The authors define sex categorization as "the sociocognitive process by which we label another as male or female."&lt;ref name="Wiley" /&gt;

In most cases, men and women and boys and girls are similar in behavior, with little gender difference, but some gendered behavior is influenced by prenatal and early life androgen exposure. This includes, for example, gender normative play, self-identification with a gender, and tendency to engage in aggressive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hines|first1=Melissa|last2=Constantinescu|first2=Mihaela|last3=Spencer|first3=Debra|title=Early androgen exposure and human gender development|journal=Biology of Sex Differences|date=26 February 2015|volume=6|pages=3|doi=10.1186/s13293-015-0022-1|pmc=4350266|issn=2042-6410|pmid=25745554}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males of most mammals, including humans, exhibit more rough and tumble play behavior, which is influenced by maternal testosterone levels.

The [[sexual dimorphism#Psychological and behavioral differentiation|biology of gender]] became the subject of an expanding number of studies over the course of the late 20th century. One of the earliest areas of interest was what became known as "gender identity disorder" (GID) and which is now also described as [[gender dysphoria]]. Studies in this, and related areas, inform the following summary of the subject by John Money. He stated:

{{quote|The term "gender role" appeared in print first in 1955. The term ''gender identity'' was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is sub-divisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and post-pubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7996589|year=1994|last1=Money|first1=J|title=The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years|volume=20|issue= 3|pages=163–177|doi= 10.1080/00926239408403428|journal= Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Money refers to attempts to distinguish a difference between biological sex and social gender as "scientifically debased", because of our increased knowledge of a continuum of [[sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] features (Money's word is "dipolar") that link biological and behavioral differences. These extend from the exclusively biological "genetic" and "prenatal hormonal" differences between men and women, to "postnatal" features, some of which are social, but others have been shown to result from "post-pubertal hormonal" effects.

Although causation from the biological—[[Genetics|genetic]] and [[Sex steroids|hormonal]]—to the behavioral has been broadly demonstrated and accepted, Money is careful to also note that understanding of the causal chains from biology to behavior in sex and gender issues is very far from complete. For example, the existence of a "[[Biology and sexual orientation|gay gene]]" has not been proven, but such a gene remains an acknowledged possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= Michael | last= Abrams | url= http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jun/born-gay/article_view?b_start:int=0&amp;-C= | title= The Real Story on Gay Genes: Homing in on the science of homosexuality—and sexuality itself| work= [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]  | date= June 2007 | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are studies concerning women who have a condition called [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], which leads to the overproduction of the masculine sex [[hormone]], [[androgen]]. These women usually have ordinary female appearances (though nearly all girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) have corrective surgery performed on their genitals). However, despite taking hormone-balancing medication given to them at birth, these females are statistically more likely to be interested in activities traditionally linked to males than female activities. Psychology professor and CAH researcher Dr. Sheri Berenbaum attributes these differences to an exposure of higher levels of male sex hormones in utero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Beattie-Moss | first = Melissa | authorlink =  | title = Are gender differences predetermined? | website =  | publisher = [[Penn State University]] | date = 8 June 2005 | url = http://www.rps.psu.edu/probing/gender.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060113080145/http://www.rps.psu.edu/probing/gender.html | url-status=dead | archive-date = 13 January 2006 | doi =  | accessdate = 30 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender taxonomy ===
The following [[gender taxonomy]] illustrates the kinds of diversity that have been studied and reported in medical literature. It is placed in roughly chronological order of biological and social development in the human [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The earlier stages are more purely biological and the latter are more dominantly social. Causation is known to operate from chromosome to gonads, and from gonads to hormones. It is also significant from brain structure to gender identity (see Money quote above). Brain structure and processing (biological) that may explain erotic preference (social), however, is an area of ongoing research. Terminology in some areas changes quite rapidly as knowledge grows.
* [[chromosome]]s: 46,XX ([[Female|genetic female]]); 46,XY ([[Male|genetic male]]) ;45,X ([[Turner's syndrome]]); 47,XXY ([[Klinefelter syndrome]]); 47,XYY ([[XYY syndrome]]); 47,XXX ([[XXX syndrome]]); 48,XXYY ([[XXYY syndrome]]); 46,XX/XY [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]]; other mosaic;
* [[gonad]]s: [[testicle]]s; [[ovary|ovaries]]; ovarian and testicular tissues, not in same gonad ([[true hermaphroditism]]), [[Ovotestis|ovotestes]], or other [[gonadal dysgenesis]];
* [[hormone]]s: [[androgen]]s (including [[testosterone]], [[dihydrotestosterone]], etc.), [[estrogen]]s (including [[estradiol]], [[estriol]], etc.), [[antiandrogen]]s, [[progestogen]]s, and [[List of human hormones|others]];

* [[Secondary sex characteristic#In humans|secondary sexual characteristics]]: dimorphic physical characteristics, other than primary characteristics (such as [[Androgenic hair|body hair]], development of [[breast]]s); certain changes in brain structure due to organizing effects of sex hormones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Is it useful to view the brain as a secondary sexual characteristic?| journal= Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume = 46 Pt 4| date= October 2014| number= 46 Pt 4| pages= 628–38 | doi= 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.08.009| last1= Ball | first1= GF | last2= Balthazart | first2= J | last3= McCarthy | first3= MM | pmid= 25195165}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[gender identity]]: one’s sense of oneself as a [[man]], [[woman]], or [[Gender variance|gender non-conforming]];

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
{{See also|Sexual differentiation|Sexual dimorphism|Sex differences in humans}}
[[File:Peacock courting peahen.jpg|thumb|Sexual differentiation in [[peafowl]]]]
Although sexual reproduction is ''defined'' at the cellular level, key features of sexual reproduction operate ''within'' the structures of the gamete cells themselves. Notably, gametes carry very long molecules called [[DNA]] that the biological processes of reproduction can "read" like a book of instructions. In fact, there are typically many of these "books", called ''chromosomes''. Human gametes usually have 23 chromosomes, 22 of which are common to both sexes. The final chromosomes in the two human gametes are called ''sex'' chromosomes because of their role in [[Sex-determination systems|sex determination]]. [[Ovum|Ova]] always have the same sex chromosome, labelled ''[[X chromosome|X]]''. About half of [[spermatozoa]] also have this same X chromosome, the rest have a [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]]. At fertilization the gametes fuse to form a cell, usually with 46 chromosomes, and either XX female or XY male, depending on whether the sperm carried an X or a Y chromosome. Some of the other possibilities are listed [[Gender#Gender taxonomy|above]].{{fact|date=June 2019}}

Genes which are specific to the X or Y chromosome are called [[sex-linked genes]]. For example, the genes which create red and green retinal photoreceptors are located on the X chromosome, which men only have one of. Thus [[red-green color blindness]] is an [[X-linked recessive inheritance|X-linked recessive trait]] and is much more common in men. However, [[sex-limited genes]] on any chromosome can be expressed to indicate, for example, "if in a male body, do X; otherwise, do not."{{fact|date=June 2019}}

The human [[XY sex-determination system|XY system]] is not the only sex determination system. Birds typically have a reverse, ZW system—males are ZZ and females ZW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1= Maria | last1= Lepowsky | first2= JS | last2= Chafetz | title= The Encyclopedic Entry of Gender | via = Reference.com; Dictionary.com| year= 2008| isbn= }}{{nonspecific| date= February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether male or female birds influence the sex of offspring is not known for all species. Several species of [[butterfly]] are known to have female parent sex determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2= Sahara|first2=K.|last3=Marec|first3=F.|year= 2007|title=Sex Chromosomes and Sex Determination in Lepidoptera|journal=Sexual Development|volume=1|issue=6|pages=332–46|doi=10.1159/000111765|pmid=18391545|quote=The speciose insect order Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) and their closest relatives, Trichoptera (caddis flies), share a female-heterogametic sex chromosome system|last1=Traut|first1=W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[platypus]] has a complex hybrid system, the male has ten sex chromosomes, half X and half Y.&lt;ref name="discoverPlatypus"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/apr/sex-ys-platypuses0425/|title=Sex, Ys, and Platypuses|publisher=Discover|author=Selim, Jocelyn |date=25 April 2005|accessdate=7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, what is functionally relevant are differences in composition and "wiring". [[Richard J.

It has also been demonstrated that brain processing responds to the external environment. Learning, both of ideas and behaviors, appears to be coded in brain processes. It also appears that in several simplified cases this coding operates differently, but in some ways equivalently, in the brains of men and women.&lt;ref&gt;"Even when men and women do the same chores equally well, they may use different brain circuits to get the same result." Linda Marsha (July 2007).

== Gender studies ==
{{Main|Gender studies}}
[[Gender studies]] is a [[Field of study|field]] of [[interdisciplinary]] study and [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to gender, [[gender identity]] and gendered [[Representation (politics)|representation]] as central categories of analysis. This field includes [[Women's studies]] (concerning [[women]], [[feminity]], their [[gender role]]s and politics, and [[feminism]]), [[Men's studies]] (concerning [[men]], [[masculinity]], their [[gender role]]s, and politics), and [[LGBT studies]].&lt;ref name="whitman"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212181127/http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies | url-status=dead | archive-date=12 December 2012 | title=Gender Studies | publisher=Whitman College | accessdate=2 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes Gender studies is offered together with Study of [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]].
These disciplines study gender and sexuality in the fields of literature and language, [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[Film studies|cinema]] and [[media studies]], human development, law, and medicine.&lt;ref name="uchicago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gendersexuality.uchicago.edu/about/|title=About – Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS)|publisher=[[The University of Chicago]]|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology and sociology ==
{{See also|Sex and psychology}}
Many of the more complicated human behaviors are influenced by both innate factors and by environmental ones, which include everything from genes, gene expression, and body chemistry, through diet and social pressures. A large area of research in [[behavioralism|behavioral psychology]] collates evidence in an effort to discover [[correlation]]s between behavior and various possible antecedents such as genetics, gene regulation, access to food and vitamins, culture, gender, hormones, physical and social development, and physical and social environments.{{fact|date=June 2019}}

A core research area within sociology is the way human behavior operates on ''itself'', in other words, how the behavior of one group or individual influences the behavior of other groups or individuals. Starting in the late 20th century, the feminist movement has contributed extensive study of gender and theories about it, notably within sociology but not restricted to it.{{Fact|date=June 2019}}

Social theorists have sought to determine the specific nature of gender in relation to biological sex and sexuality,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} with the result being that culturally established gender and sex have become interchangeable identifications that signify the allocation of a specific 'biological' sex within a categorical gender.{{Citation needed| date= May 2008}} The second wave feminist view that gender is socially constructed and hegemonic in all societies, remains current in some literary theoretical circles, Kira Hall and Mary Bucholtz publishing new perspectives as recently as 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6d37lDUcLYEC&amp;pg=PP11 |title= Gender Articulated |accessdate= 21 September 2008 |publisher= Routledge |isbn= 978-0-415-91399-7 |year= 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary socialisation theory proposes the notion that when a child is first born it has a biological sex but no social gender.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} As the child grows, "...society provides a string of prescriptions, templates, or models of behaviors appropriate to the one sex or the other,"&lt;ref&gt;Connell, R.

Some believe society is constructed in a way that splits gender into a dichotomy via social organisations that constantly invent and reproduce cultural images of gender. Joan Acker believes gendering occurs in at least five different interacting social processes:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| year= 1990|title= Hierarchies, Jobs, Bodies: A Theory of Gendered Organizations|url=http://www.csun.edu/~snk1966/J.%20Acker%20Hierarchies,%20Jobs,%20Bodies%20--%20A%20Theory%20of%20Gendered%20Organizations.pdf|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=4|issue=2|pages=139–158|doi= 10.1177/089124390004002002|jstor=189609|last1=Acker|first1=J.|citeseerx= 10.1.1.693.1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The construction of divisions along the lines of gender, such as those produced by labor, power, family, the state, even allowed behaviors and locations in physical space
* The construction of symbols and images such as language, ideology, dress and the media, that explain, express and reinforce, or sometimes oppose, those divisions
* Interactions between men and women, women and women and men and men that involve any form of dominance and submission. Conversational theorists, for example, have studied the way that interruptions, turn taking and the setting of topics re-create gender inequality in the flow of ordinary talk
* The way that the preceding three processes help to produce gendered components of individual identity, i.e., the way they create and maintain an image of a gendered self
* Gender is implicated in the fundamental, ongoing processes of creating and conceptualising social structures.

Looking at gender through a Foucauldian lens, gender is transfigured into a vehicle for the social division of power. Gender difference is merely a construct of society used to enforce the distinctions made between what is assumed to be female and male, and allow for the domination of masculinity over femininity through the attribution of specific gender-related characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Deji, Olanike F. (2012) ''Gender Concepts and Theories''. Gender and Rural Development. Berlin: Lit. N..&lt;/ref&gt; "The idea that men and women are more different from one another than either is from anything else, must come from something other than nature... far from being an expression of natural differences, exclusive gender identity is the suppression of natural similarities."&lt;ref name=glover&gt;Glover, D and Kaplan, C (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2NLbiutayFoC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Genders''], Routledge, New York {{ISBN|0-415-44243-5}}, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender conventions play a large role in attributing masculine and feminine characteristics to a fundamental biological sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary| last= Mikkola | first= Mari | title= Feminist Perspectives on Sex and Gender | encyclopedia= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | edition= Spring 2016 |editor-first= Edward N. | editor-last= Zalta | url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/feminism-gender/ | publisher= Stanford University | accessdate= | date= 12 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Socio-cultural codes and conventions, the rules by which society functions, and which are both a creation of society as well as a constituting element of it, determine the allocation of these specific traits to the sexes. These traits provide the foundations for the creation of hegemonic gender difference. It follows then, that gender can be assumed as the acquisition and internalisation of social norms. Individuals are therefore socialized through their receipt of society's expectations of 'acceptable' gender attributes that are flaunted within institutions such as the family, the state and the media. Such a notion of 'gender' then becomes naturalized into a person's sense of self or identity, effectively imposing a gendered social category upon a sexed body.&lt;ref name= glover /&gt;

The conception that people are gendered rather than sexed also coincides with Judith Butler's theories of gender performativity. Butler argues that gender is not an expression of what one is, but rather something that one does.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1999|title=Performativity, Parody, Politics|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=16|issue=2|pages=195–213|doi=10.1177/02632769922050476|last1=Lloyd|first1=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows then, that if gender is acted out in a repetitive manner it is in fact re-creating and effectively embedding itself within the social consciousness. Contemporary sociological reference to male and female gender roles typically uses ''masculinities'' and ''femininities'' in the plural rather than singular, suggesting diversity both within cultures as well as across them.

The difference between the sociological and popular definitions of gender involve a different dichotomy and focus. For example, the sociological approach to "gender" (social roles: female versus male) focuses on the difference in (economic/power) position between a male CEO (disregarding the fact that he is [[heterosexual]] or [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]) to female workers in his employ (disregarding whether they are straight or gay). However the popular sexual self-conception approach (self-conception: gay versus straight) focuses on the different self-conceptions and social conceptions of those who are gay/straight, in comparison with those who are straight (disregarding what might be vastly differing economic and power positions between female and male groups in each category). There is then, in relation to definition of and approaches to "gender", a tension between historic feminist sociology and contemporary homosexual sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1994|title=The Heterosexual Imaginary: Feminist Sociology and Theories of Gender|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=12|issue=2|pages=203–219|doi=10.2307/201865|jstor=201865|author=Ingraham, Chrys|citeseerx=10.1.1.470.737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status ==
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2019}} 
A person's sex as male or female has legal significance—sex is indicated on government documents, and laws provide differently for men and women. Many pension systems have different retirement ages for men or women. Marriage is usually only available to opposite-sex couples; in some countries and jurisdictions there are [[same-sex marriage]] laws.

The question then arises as to what legally determines whether someone is female or male. In most cases this can appear obvious, but the matter is complicated for [[intersex]] or [[transgender]] people. Different jurisdictions have adopted different answers to this question. Almost all countries permit changes of legal gender status in cases of intersexualism, when the gender assignment made at birth is determined upon further investigation to be biologically inaccurate—technically, however, this is not a change of status ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''. Rather, it is recognition of a status deemed to exist but unknown from birth. Increasingly, jurisdictions also provide a procedure for changes of legal gender for transgender people.

[[Sex assignment|Gender assignment]], when there are indications that genital sex might not be decisive in a particular case, is normally not defined by a single definition, but by a combination of conditions, including chromosomes and gonads. Thus, for example, in many jurisdictions a person with XY chromosomes but female [[gonad]]s could be recognized as female at birth.

The ability to [[Legal aspects of transsexualism|change legal gender]] for transgender people in particular has given rise to the phenomena in some jurisdictions of the same person having different genders for the purposes of different areas of the law. For example, in Australia prior to the Re Kevin decisions, transsexual people could be recognized as having the genders they identified with under many areas of the law, including social security law, but not for the law of marriage. Thus, for a period, it was possible for the same person to have two different genders under Australian law.

It is also possible in federal systems for the same person to have one gender under state law and a different gender under federal law.

=== Languages ===
{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Natural languages often make gender distinctions. These may be of various kinds, more or less loosely associated by analogy with various actual or perceived differences between men and women.  Some grammatical gender systems go beyond, or ignore, the masculine-feminine distinction.
&lt;ref&gt;Kroulek, A. (2016, January 18). Why do languages have gender? Retrieved March 12, 2018, from http://www.k-international.com/blog/why-do-languages-have-gender/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many languages include terms that are used asymmetrically in reference to men and women. Concern that current language may be biased in favor of men has led some authors in recent times to argue for the use of a more [[Gender-neutral language in English|gender-neutral vocabulary]] in English and other languages.
* Several languages attest the use of different vocabulary by men and women, to differing degrees. See, for instance, [[Gender differences in spoken Japanese]]. The oldest documented language, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], records a distinctive sub-language only used by female speakers. Conversely, many [[Indigenous Australian languages]] have distinctive registers with a limited [[lexicon]] used by men in the presence of their mothers-in-law (see [[Avoidance speech]]). As well, quite a few [[sign language]]s have a gendered distinction due to boarding schools segregated by gender, such as [[Irish Sign Language]].
* Several languages such as [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are gender-neutral. In Persian the same word is used in reference to men and women. Verbs, adjectives and nouns are not gendered. (See [[Gender-neutrality in genderless languages]])
* [[Grammatical gender]] is a property of some languages in which every [[noun]] is assigned a gender, often with no direct relation to its meaning. For example, the word for "girl" is ''[[:es:muchacha|muchacha]]'' (grammatically feminine) in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''[[:de:Mädchen|Mädchen]]'' (grammatically neuter) in [[German language|German]], and ''[[:ga:cailín|cailín]]'' (grammatically masculine) in [[Irish language|Irish]].
* The term "[[grammatical gender]]" is often applied to more complex [[noun class]] systems. This is especially true when a noun class system includes masculine and feminine as well as some other non-gender features like animate, edible, manufactured, and so forth. An example of the latter is found in the [[Dyirbal language]]. Other gender systems exist with no distinction between masculine and feminine; examples include a distinction between animate and inanimate things, which is common to, amongst others, [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]; and systems distinguishing between people (whether human or divine) and everything else, which are found in the [[Dravidian languages]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].
* Several languages employ different ways to refer to people where there are three or more genders, such as [[Navajo language|Navajo]] or [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]].

This topic includes internal and external religious issues such as [[Gender of God|gender of God and deities]] creation myths about human gender, roles and rights (for instance, leadership roles especially [[ordination of women]], [[sex segregation]], [[gender equality]], marriage, abortion, [[Homosexuality and religion|homosexuality]])

According to Kati Niemelä of the Church Research Institute, women are universally more [[religious]] than men. They believe that the difference in religiosity between genders is due to biological differences, for instance usually people seeking security in life are more religious, and as men are considered to be greater risk takers than women, they are less religious. Although [[religious fanaticism]] is more often seen in men than women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/08/women_more_religious_than_men_1939513.html Women More Religious than Men]. yle.fi (29 August 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|100px|[[Yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']]]]
In [[Taoism]], [[yin and yang]] are considered feminine and masculine, respectively. The Taijitu and concept of the Zhou period reach into family and gender relations. Yin is female and yang is male. They fit together as two parts of a whole.
The male principle was equated with the sun: active, bright, and shining; the female principle corresponds to the moon: passive, shaded, and reflective. Male toughness was balanced by female gentleness, male action and initiative by female endurance and need for completion, and male leadership by female supportiveness.

In [[Judaism]], [[God]] is traditionally described in the masculine, but in the mystical tradition of the [[Kabbalah]], the [[Shekhinah]] represents the feminine aspect of God's essence. However, Judaism [[Jewish principles of faith|traditionally holds]] that God is completely non-corporeal, and thus neither male nor female. Conceptions of the gender of God notwithstanding, traditional Judaism places a strong emphasis on individuals following Judaism's traditional gender roles, though many modern [[Jewish religious movements|denominations of Judaism]] strive for greater egalitarianism. As well, traditional Jewish culture dictates that there are [[Gender and Judaism|six genders]].

In [[Christianity]], God is traditionally described in masculine terms and the Church has historically been described in feminine terms. On the other hand, Christian [[theology]] in many churches distinguishes between the masculine images used of God (Father, King, God the Son) and the reality they signify, which transcends gender, embodies all the virtues of both men and women perfectly, which may be seen through the doctrine of [[Imago Dei]]. In the [[New Testament]], Jesus at several times mentions the Holy Spirit with the masculine pronoun i.e. John 15:26 among other verses. Hence, [[God the Father|the Father]], [[God the Son|the Son]] and [[the Holy Spirit]] (i.e. [[Trinity]]) are all mentioned with the masculine pronoun; though the exact meaning of the masculinity of the Christian triune God is contended.

In [[Hinduism]]

{{quote|One of the several forms of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] God [[Shiva]], is Ardhanarishwar (literally half-female God). Here Shiva manifests himself so that the left half is Female and the right half is Male. The left represents Shakti (energy, power) in the form of Goddess [[Parvati]] (otherwise his consort) and the right half Shiva. Whereas Parvati is the cause of arousal of Kama (desires), Shiva is the killer. Shiva is pervaded by the power of Parvati and Parvati is pervaded by the power of Shiva.

While the stone images may seem to represent a half-male and half-female God, the true symbolic representation is of a being the whole of which is Shiva and the whole of which is Shakti at the same time. It is a 3-D representation of only shakti from one angle and only Shiva from the other. Shiva and Shakti are hence the same being representing a collective of Jnana (knowledge) and Kriya (activity).

Adi Shankaracharya, the founder of non-dualistic philosophy (Advaita–"not two") in Hindu thought says in his "Saundaryalahari"—''Shivah Shaktayaa yukto yadi bhavati shaktah prabhavitum na che devum devona khalu kushalah spanditam api'' " i.e., It is only when Shiva is united with Shakti that He acquires the capability of becoming the Lord of the Universe. In the absence of Shakti, He is not even able to stir. In fact, the term "Shiva" originated from "Shva," which implies a dead body. It is only through his inherent shakti that Shiva realizes his true nature.

This mythology projects the inherent view in ancient Hinduism, that each human carries within himself both female and male components, which are forces rather than sexes, and it is the harmony between the creative and the annihilative, the strong and the soft, the proactive and the passive, that makes a true person. Such thought, leave alone entail gender equality, in fact obliterates any material distinction between the male and female altogether. This may explain why in ancient India we find evidence of homosexuality, bisexuality, androgyny, [[multiple sex partners]] and open representation of sexual pleasures in artworks like the Khajuraho temples, being accepted within prevalent social frameworks.|&lt;ref name="vohra"&gt;"The Male-Female Hologram," Ashok Vohra, [[Times of India]], March 8, 2005, Page 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Poverty ===
{{Main|Feminization of poverty}}

Gender inequality is most common in women dealing with poverty. Many women must shoulder all the responsibility of the household because they must take care of the family. Oftentimes this may include tasks such as tilling land, grinding grain, carrying water and cooking.&lt;ref name=UNPD&gt;[http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/povertyreduction/focus_areas/focus_gender_and_poverty/ Gender and Poverty Reduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029203731/http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/ourwork/povertyreduction/focus_areas/focus_gender_and_poverty/ |date=29 October 2014 }}.

=== General strain theory ===
According to [[general strain theory]], studies suggest that gender differences between individuals can lead to externalized anger that may result in violent outbursts.&lt;ref name="Agnew, Robert 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2012|title=Reflection on "A Revised Strain Theory of Delinquency"|journal=Social Forces|volume=91|pages=33–38|doi=10.1093/sf/sos117|last1=Agnew|first1=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These violent actions related to gender inequality can be measured by comparing violent neighborhoods to non-violent neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Agnew, Robert 2012" /&gt; By noticing the independent variables (neighborhood violence) and the dependent variable (individual violence), it's possible to analyze gender roles.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Kempf-Leonard|first2=K.|last3=Mullins|first3=C.|year=2014|title=Gender and Juvenile Drug Abuse: A General Strain Theory Perspective|journal=Women &amp; Criminal Justice|volume=24|pages=22–43|doi=10.1080/08974454.2013.842519|last1=Grothoff|first1=G. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strain in the general strain theory is the removal of a positive stimulus and or the introduction of a negative stimulus, which would create a negative effect (strain) within individual, which is either inner-directed (depression/guilt) or outer-directed (anger/frustration), which depends on whether the individual blames themselves or their environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Blurton|first2=D.|last3=McCluskey|first3=J.D.|year=2007|title=General Strain Theory and Delinquency: Focusing on the Influences of Key Strain Characteristics on Delinquency|journal=Crime &amp; Delinquency|volume=54|issue=4|pages=582–613|doi=10.1177/0011128707301627|last1=Moon|first1=B.|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0977d920c8d86851d2b6a3a2df613e3c745447fc}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies reveal that even though males and females are equally likely to react to a strain with anger, the origin of the anger and their means of coping with it can vary drastically.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Males are likely to put the blame on others for adversity and therefore externalize feelings of anger.&lt;ref name="Agnew, Robert 2012" /&gt; Females typically internalize their angers and tend to blame themselves instead.&lt;ref name="Agnew, Robert 2012" /&gt; Female internalized anger is accompanied by feelings of guilt, fear, anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com" /&gt; Women view anger as a sign that they've somehow lost control, and thus worry that this anger may lead them to harm others and/or damage relationships. On the other end of the spectrum, men are less concerned with damaging relationships and more focused on using anger as a means of affirming their masculinity.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com" /&gt; According to the general strain theory, men would more likely engage in aggressive behavior directed towards others due to externalized anger whereas women would direct their anger towards themselves rather than others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; Also emotions could be influenced by gender. Results of Ingram et al. (2012) study shows ,,Feelings of anger were hypothesized to be reported more often in the descriptions of past conflicts of boys than in the descriptions of past conflicts of girls". On the other hand: "boys were no more likely than girls to describe feelings of anger ensuing from a conflict". Cause of this fact remains unclear although is discussed in Trnka's study (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trnka|first=Radek|date=October 2013|title=Gender Differences in Human Interpersonal Conflicts: A Reply to|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|volume=11|issue=4|pages=147470491301100|doi=10.1177/147470491301100401|issn=1474-7049}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown participants were able to recognize the facial expression of fear significantly better on a male face than on a female face.

=== Economic development ===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
Gender, and particularly the role of women is widely recognized as vitally important to [[international development]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;Adema, W., Ali, N., Frey, V., Kim, H., Lunati, M., Piacentini, M. and Queisser, M. (2014). Enhancing Women's Economic Empowerment Through Entrepreneurship and Business leadership in OECD Countries. OECD.&lt;/ref&gt; This often means a focus on gender-equality, ensuring [[participation (decision making)|participation]], but includes an understanding of the different roles and expectation of the genders within the community.&lt;ref&gt;OECD, ILO, IMF and WBG, (2014). Achieving stronger growth by promoting a more genderbalanced economy. Report prepared for the G20 Labour and Employment Ministerial Meeting. Melbourne, Australia: G20 Labour and Employment Ministerial Meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, the study of gender and development has become a broad field that involves politicians, economists, and [[human rights defender|human rights activists]]. Gender and Development, unlike previous theories concerning women in development, includes a broader view of the effects of development on gender including economic, political, and social issues. The theory takes a holistic approach to development and its effects on women and recognizes the negative effects gender blind development policies have had on women. Prior to 1970, it was believed that development affected men and women in the same way and no gendered perspective existed for development studies. However, the 1970s saw a transformation in development theory that sought to incorporate women into existing development paradigms.

When [[Ester Boserup]] published her book, ''Woman’s Role in Economic Development'', there was a realization that development affected men and women differently and there began to be more of a focus on women and development. Boserup argued that women were marginalized in the modernization process and practices of growth, development, and development policy threatened to actually make women worse off.
Boserup's work translated into the beginning of a larger discourse termed [[Women in Development]] (WID) coined by the Women's Committee of the Washington DC Chapter of the [[Society for International Development]], a network of female development professionals. The primary goal of WID was to include women into existing development initiatives, since it was argued that women were marginalized and excluded from the benefits of development. In so doing, the WID approach pointed out that the major problem to women's unequal representation and participation were male biased and patriarchal development policies. In short, the WID approach blamed patriarchy, which did not consider women's productive and reproductive work. In fact, women were tied to domestic work hence were almost invisible in development programs. The WID approach, however, began to gain criticism as ignoring how women's economic [[marginalization]] was linked to the development model itself.

Some feminists{{who|date=July 2016}} argued that the key concept for women and development should be subordination in the context of new capitalist forms of insecure and hierarchical job structures, rather than marginalization as WID approaches emphasized. The rise of criticism against the WID approach led to the emergence of a new theory, that of Women and Development (WAD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Muyoyeta |first1=Lucy |title=Women, Gender and Development |date=2004 |publisher=Women for Change |location=Zambia |isbn=095351367X |url=https://www.developmenteducation.ie/media/documents/women_gender_dev.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, just as WID had its critics, so did WAD. Critics{{who|date=July 2016}} of WAD argued that it failed to sufficiently address the differential power relations between women and men, and tended to overemphasize women's productive as opposed to reproductive roles. Also, rising criticism of the exclusion of men in WID and WAD led to a new theory termed [[Gender and Development]] (GAD). Drawing from insights developed in psychology, sociology, and gender studies, GAD theorists shifted from understanding women's problems as based on their sex (i.e. their biological differences from men) to understanding them as based on gender – the social relations between women and men, their social construction, and how women have been systematically subordinated in this relationship.

At their most fundamental, GAD perspectives link the social relations of production with the social relations of reproduction – exploring why and how women and men are assigned to different roles and responsibilities in society, how these dynamics are reflected in social, economic, and political theories and institutions, and how these relationships affect development policy effectiveness. According to proponents of GAD, women are cast not as passive recipients of development aid, but rather as active agents of change whose empowerment should be a central goal of development policy. In contemporary times, most literature and institutions that are concerned with women's role in development incorporate a GAD perspective, with the United Nations taking the lead of mainstreaming the GAD approach through its system and development policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=United Nations. Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues, &amp; Advancement of Women |title=Gender Mainstreaming an Overview |date=2002 |publisher=United Nations Publications |location=New York |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/e65237.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have highlighted that policy dialogue on the [[Millennium Development Goals]] needs to recognize that the gender dynamics of power, poverty, [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] and care link all the goals.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results |title=Gender and the MDGS |date=September 2008 |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310100258/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results |archivedate=10 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The various United Nations international women's conferences in Beijing, Mexico City, Copenhagen, and Nairobi, as well as the development of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000 have taken a GAD approach and holistic view of development. The [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]] signed at the United Nations Millennium Summit in 2000 including eight goals that were to be reached by 2015, and although it would be a difficult task to reach them, all of them could be monitored. The eight goals are:
# Halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty at the 1990 level by 2015.
# Achieve universal primary education
# Promote gender equality and empower women
# Reduce child mortality rates
# Improve maternal health
# Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria and other diseases
# Ensure environmental sustainability
# Global partnership

The MDGs have three goals specifically focused on women: Goal 3, 4 and 5 but women's issues also cut across all of the goals. These goals overall comprise all aspects of women's lives including economic, health, and political participation.

Gender equality is also strongly linked to [[education]]. The [[Dakar Framework for Action]] (2000) set out ambitious goals: to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005, and to achieve gender equality in education by 2015. The focus was on ensuring girls' full and equal access to and achievement in good quality basic education. The gender objective of the Dakar Framework for Action is somewhat different from the MDG Goal 3 (Target 1): "Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015". MDG Goal 3 does not comprise a reference to learner achievement and good quality basic education, but goes beyond the school level. Studies demonstrate the positive impact of girls' education on child and maternal health, fertility rates, poverty reduction and economic growth. Educated mothers are more likely to send their children to school.&lt;ref name="Achieving Gender Equality"&gt;[http://www.iiep.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Info_Services_Newsletter/pdf/eng/2010/2010_1En.pdf IIEP Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716103610/http://www.iiep.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Info_Services_Newsletter/pdf/eng/2010/2010_1En.pdf |date=16 July 2011 }}, Achieving Gender Equality in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations working in developing countries and in the development field have incorporated advocacy and empowerment for women into their work. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO) adopted a 10-year strategic framework in November 2009 that includes the strategic objective of gender equity in access to resources, goods, services and decision-making in rural areas, and mainstreams gender equity in all FAO's programs for agriculture and rural development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/gender/gender-home/gender-programme/gender-equity/en/|title= Gender equity|date=November 2009|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Progressive Communications]] (APC) has developed a [[Gender Evaluation Methodology]] for planning and evaluating development projects to ensure they benefit all sectors of society including women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderevaluation.net/ Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM)]. genderevaluation.net&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gender-related Development Index (GDI), developed by the United Nations, aims to show the inequalities between men and women in the following areas: long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has introduced indicators designed to add a gendered dimension to the Human Development Index (HDI). Additionally, in 1995, the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI) and the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM) were introduced. More recently, in 2010, UNDP introduced a new indicator, the [[Gender Inequality Index]] (GII), which was designed to be a better measurement of gender inequality and to improve the shortcomings of GDI and GEM.

=== Climate change ===
{{Main|Climate change and gender}}
Gender is a topic of increasing concern within [[climate change]] policy and science.&lt;ref name="Olsson"&gt;Olsson, Lennart'' et al.''

Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, gender approaches to climate change address gender-differentiated consequences of climate change, as well as unequal [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] capacities and gendered contribution to climate change. Furthermore, the intersection of climate change and gender raises questions regarding the complex and [[intersectionality|intersecting]] power relations arising from it. These differences, however, are mostly not due to biological or physical differences, but are formed by the social, institutional and legal context. Subsequently, [[vulnerability]] is less an intrinsic feature of women and girls but rather a product of their marginalization.&lt;ref name="Birkmann"&gt;Birkmann, Joern et al.

Geraldine Terry and Caroline Sweetman (eds.). Warwickshire: Practical Action Publishing, Oxfam GB.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some feminist scholars hold that the debate on climate change is not only dominated by men but also primarily shaped in ‘masculine’ principles, which limits discussions about climate change to a perspective that focuses on technical solutions.&lt;ref name="Tuana" /&gt; This perception of climate change hides subjectivity and power relations that actually condition climate-change policy and science, leading to a phenomenon that Tuana&lt;ref name="Tuana" /&gt; terms ‘epistemic injustice’.

They further showed that women's posts enjoyed higher popularity than men's post''s.''

Social media is more than just the communication of words. With social media increasing in popularity, pictures have come to play a large role in how many people communicate.

According to recent research, gender plays a strong role in structuring our social lives, especially since society assigns and creates "male" and "female" categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hodkinson|first1=P.|title=Bedrooms and beyond: Youth, identity and privacy on social network sites|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=19|issue=2|pages=272–288|date=22 September 2015|doi=10.1177/1461444815605454|url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/809096/9/bedrooms%20and%20beyond%20nms%20paper%20-%20for%20repository.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals in society might be able to learn the similarities between gender rather than the differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Mackey-Kallis|first2=Susan|last3=Shyles|first3=Len|last4=Barry|first4=Kelly|last5=Biagini|first5=Danielle|last6=Hart|first6=Colleen|last7=Jack|first7=Lauren|date=November 2012|title=Face it: The Impact of Gender on Social Media Images|journal=Communication Quarterly|volume=60|issue=5|pages=588–607|doi=10.1080/01463373.2012.725005|last1=Rose|first1=Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media helps create more equality, because every individual is able to express him- or herself however they like. Every individual also has the right to express their opinion, even though some might disagree, but it still gives each gender an equal amount of power to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=HA |last2=Eichstaedt |first2=JC |last3=Kern |first3=ML |last4=Dziurzynski |first4=L |last5=Ramones |first5=SM |last6=Agrawal |first6=M |last7=Shah |first7=A |last8=Kosinski |first8=M |last9=Stillwell |first9=D |last10=Seligman |first10=ME |last11=Ungar |first11=LH |title=Personality, gender, and age in the language of social media: the open-vocabulary approach. |journal=PLOS ONE |date=2013 |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=e73791 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0073791 |pmid=24086296|pmc=3783449 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...873791S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young adults in the U.S. frequently use social networking sites as a way to connect and communicate with one another, as well as to satisfy their curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Explaining why young adults use MySpace and Facebook through uses and gratifications theory|last2=Dong|first2=Q|last3=Day|first3=K.D|date=2009|edition=2|pages=215–229|last1=Urista|first1=M.A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescent girls generally use social networking sites as a tool to communicate with peers and reinforce existing relationships; boys on the other hand tend to use social networking sites as a tool to meet new friends and acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Older adolescents' motivations for social network site use: The influence of gender, group identity, and collective self-esteem|publisher=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|edition=2|pages=209–213|last1=Barker|first1=V}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, social networking sites have allowed individuals to truly express themselves, as they are able to create an identity and socialize with other individuals that can relate.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Ridder|first1=Sander|last2=van Bauwel|first2=Sofie|title=Youth and intimate media cultures: Gender, sexuality, relationships, and desire as storytelling practices in social networking sites|journal=Communications|date=1 January 2015|volume=40|issue=3|doi=10.1515/commun-2015-0012|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/5889652/file/7011376.pdf|hdl=1854/LU-5889652}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social networking sites have also given individuals access to create a space where they feel more comfortable about their sexuality.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Recent research has indicated that social media is becoming a stronger part of younger individuals' media culture, as more intimate stories are being told via social media and are being intertwined with gender, sexuality, and relationships.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Teens are avid internet and social media users in the United States. Research has found that almost all U.S. teens (95%) aged 12 through 17 are online, compared to only 78% of adults. Of these teens, 80% have profiles on social media sites, as compared to only 64% of the online population aged 30 and older. According to a study conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 11-to-18 year-olds spend on average over one and a half hours a day using a computer and 27 minutes per day visiting social network sites, i.e. the latter accounts for about one fourth of their daily computer use.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herring|first1=Susan|last2=Kapidzic|first2=Sanja|title=Teens, Gender, and Self-Presentation in Social Media|date=2015|publisher=International encyclopedia of social and behavioral sciences|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teen girls and boys differ in what they post in their online profiles. Studies have shown that female users tend to post more "cute" pictures, while male participants were more likely to post pictures of themselves in activities. Women in the U.S. also tend to post more pictures of friends, while men tend to post more about sports and humorous links. The study also found that males would post more alcohol and sexual references.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; The roles were reversed however, when looking at a teenage dating site: women made sexual references significantly more often than males.

Boys share more personal information, such as their hometown and phone number, while girls are more conservative about the personal information they allow to go public on these social networking sites. Boys, meanwhile, are more likely to orient towards technology, sports, and humor in the information they post to their profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malin|first1=Sveningsson Elm|title=Doing and undoing gender in a Swedish Internet community|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kau:diva-18434|accessdate=14 April 2016|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media goes beyond the role of helping individuals express themselves, as it has grown to help individuals create relationships, particularly romantic relationships. A large number of social media users have found it easier to create relationships in a less direct approach, compared to a traditional approach of awkwardly asking for someone's number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Role of Facebook in Romantic Relationship Development: An Exploration of Knapp's Relational Stage Model|date=2012|publisher=Conference Papers – International Communication Association|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media plays a big role when it comes to communication between genders. Therefore it's important to understand how gender stereotypes develop during online interactions. Research in the 1990s suggested that different genders display certain traits, such as being active, attractive, dependent, dominant, independent, sentimental, sexy, and submissive, in online interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Gauntlett|first1=D|title=Media, Gender and Identity: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ScR9AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=gender%2Band%2Bsocial%2Bmedia#v=onepage&amp;q=gender%20and%20social%20media|website=Media, Gender and Identity|accessdate=14 April 2016|isbn=978-1-134-15502-6|date=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though these traits continue to be displayed through gender stereotypes, recent studies show that this isn't necessarily the case any more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Herring|first1=I|title=Teens, Gender, and Self-Presentation in Social Media.

[[File:Comparison Bioresilience with Biodiversity.jpg|thumb|Comparing the Features of Bioresilience and Biodiversity as Found on a Mountain Slope]]
'''Bioresilience''' refers to the ability of a whole [[species]] or an [[individual]] of a species to adapt to change. Initially the term applied to changes in the [[natural environment]], but increasingly it is also used for adaptation to anthropogenically induced change.&lt;ref name=r0&gt;{{Cite journal|date = 2014 | title = Vanishing fauna (Special issue)|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=345|issue=6195| pages = 392–412 |url =http://www.sciencemag.org/site/special/vanishing/index.xhtml?_ga=1.172413478.429831163.1471029002 |doi= 10.1126/science.345.6195.392| pmid = 25061199| bibcode=| last1 = Vignieri| first1 = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Alexander von Humboldt]] was the first to note the resilience of [[life forms]] with increasing [[altitude]] and the accompanying decreasing prevalence in numbers, and he documented this in the 18th century on the slopes of the volcano [[Chimborazo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrea |last=Wulf |title=The Invention of Nature |location=New York |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |issue=5927 |pages=596–597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.1171659|pmid=19407186 |year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding of bioresilience evolved from research led by [[The Mountain Institute]] when establishing two of the national parks that surround [[Mount Everest]], [[Makalu-Barun National Park]] in [[Nepal]], and [[Qomolangma National Nature Preserve]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=T.B |last=Shrestha |title=Development Ecology of the Arun River Basin in Nepal |location=Kathmandu |publisher=International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research documented greater [[biodiversity]] at Everest’s base than higher up. There were progressively fewer documented species as the mountain ascended into higher [[biomes]], from [[subtropical]] to [[temperate]] to [[Alpine climate|alpine]] to Arctic-like. These fewer species, though, had greater biologic [[robustness]] correlating directly with increasing bioresilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Daniel |last=Taylor-Ide |title=Something Hidden Behind the Ranges: A Himalayan Quest |location=San Francisco |publisher=Mercury House |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Current research==
Monitoring of bioresilience, beginning in the [[Everest]] ecosystem but expanding to other mountain ecologies globally is being carried out by the Biomeridian Project at [[Future Generations University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Impacts on Life from Climate Change|url=https://www.future.edu/biomeridian/|website=Future Generations University|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of bioresilience has also been applied to human health to explain aging or chronic diseases decrease the ability of the body to adapt; in such cases, the system becomes rigid and unable to cross different life demands. As the human body loses robustness with age, an individual becomes unable to accommodate new life demands, be they contagions, stress, or events such as injury or even jet lag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Yun |first=Joon | title=The Key To Health In Old Age: Bioresilience | website=[[Forbes]] | date=June 18, 2018 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nextavenue/2018/06/18/the-key-to-health-in-old-age-bioresillience/|accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of resilience in biological systems has been widely recognized in terms of the impacts on life by anthropogenic changes.&lt;ref name=r0/&gt; Accelerating environmental change and continuing loss of genetic resources positions lower biodiversity around the planet threatening ecosystem services. A major mitigating factor will be life forms with higher resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Oliver |first=Tom H. |last2= Heard |first2=Mathew S. |first3= Nick J.B. |last3=Isaac |last4= Roy |first4=David B. |first5=Deborah |last5=Procter |first6=Felix |last6=Eigenbrod |first7=Rob |last7=Freckleton |first8=Andy |last8=Hector |first9=C. David L. |last9=Orme |first10=Owen L. |last10=Petchey |first11=Vânia |last11=Proença |first12=David |last12=Raffaelli |first13=K.

Paralleling the work in mountain environments, a growing number of studies is applying the concept of bioresilience to assess the robustness of life in other ecological systems challenged by the Anthropocene. One such study was with the adaptive renewal and natural perturbation in Lake Victoria, the world’s second largest freshwater lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Awiti |first=Alex O. |title=Biological Diversity and Resilience: Lessons from the Recovery of Cichlid Species in Lake Victoria |journal=[[Ecology &amp; Society]] |date=2011 |volume=16 |issue=1 |url=https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol16/iss1/art9/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extremophiles in biotechnology''' is the application of organisms that thrive in extreme environments to [[biotechnology]].

[[Extremophile]]s are organisms that thrive in the most volatile environments on the planet and it is due to their talents that they haven begun playing a large role in biotechnology. These organisms live everywhere from environments of high acidity or salinity to areas with limited or no oxygen are places they call home. Scientists show keen interest in organisms with rare or strange talents and in the past 20-30 years extremophiles have been at the forefront with thousands of researchers delving into their abilities.&lt;ref name = "Cowan_1992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cowan DA | title = Biotechnology of the Archaea | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 315–23 | date = September 1992 | pmid = 1369088 | doi = 10.1016/0167-7799(92)90257-v }}&lt;/ref&gt; The area in which there has been the most talk, research, and development in relation to these organisms is biotechnology. Scientists around the globe are either extracting DNA to modify genomes or directly using extremophiles to complete tasks.&lt;ref name = "Herbert_1992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herbert RA | title = A perspective on the biotechnological potential of extremophiles | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = 395–402 | date = November 1992 | pmid = 1368881 | doi = 10.1016/0167-7799(92)90282-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the discovery and interest in these organisms the enzymes used in PCR were found, making the rapid replication of DNA in the lab possible. Since they gained the spotlight researchers have been amassing databases of genome data for the hopes that new traits and abilities can be used to further biotechnical advancements Everything from the biodegradation of waste to the production of new fuels is on the horizon with the developments made in the field of biotechnology. There are many different kinds of extremophiles with each kind favoring a different environment. These organisms have become more and more important to biotechnology as their genomes have been uncovered, revealing a plethora of genetic potential. Currently the main uses of extremophiles lies in processes such as PCR, biofuel generation and biomining, but there are many other smaller scale operations at play. There are also labs that have identified what they wish to do with extremophiles, but haven't been able to fully achieve their goals. While these large scale goals have not yet been met the scientific community is working towards their completion in hope of creating new technologies and processes.

== Overview of extremophiles ==
[[File:T.aq.png|alt=|thumb|Thermal lake in which thermophilic extremophiles thrive.]]
Extremophile is the term that covers a large group of organisms, most prominently [[Archaea|Archaeans]], which have evolved to fill the niches of extremely inhospitable environments. Such environments include high or low temperatures, high levels of salinity, high or low pH levels, and areas where volatile chemicals are prominent. These organisms have made some of the most undesirable locations on the planet their home. A few examples of these locations include thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean, soda lakes, runoffs from chemical factories and the trash heaps of landfills.

There are 4 major types of extremophiles:

=== Thermophiles ===
Thermophilic extremophiles live in areas of extreme heat with the best example being geothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean. The benefit of these organisms lies in the polymers and enzymes produced within them as they are highly thermostable.&lt;ref name = "Cowan_1985"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cowan D, Daniel R, Morgan H |date=1985 |title=Thermophilic proteases: Properties and potential applications |journal=Trends in Biotechnology |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=68–72 |doi=10.1016/0167-7799(85)90080-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Herbert_1992" /&gt;

=== Halophilies ===
Halophilic extremophiles live in areas of high salinity such as solar salterns and soda lakes. Their ability to consume and thrive in areas of such salinity open up possible benefits such as inoculating crops in salt rich soils to help them grow. Another use found for them lies in their production of polymers used to make biodegradable plastics.&lt;ref name = "Herbert_1992" /&gt;

=== Methanogens ===
Methanogenic extremophiles live just about anywhere and are the most widespread. These organisms take various simple organic compounds and use them to synthesize methane as their source of energy. There are no other known organisms that use the synthesis of methane as a form of energy production.&lt;ref name = "Herbert_1992" /&gt;

=== Psychrophiles ===
Psychrophilic Extremophiles have the ability to maintain high growth rates and enzyme activity at temperatures even as low as 0℃. This presents the possibility of utilizing enzymes found in these organisms in parallel to how thermophilic organism enzymes are used, but at low temperatures as opposed to high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Margesin R, Schinner F |date=1994 |title=Properties of cold-adapted microorganisms and their potential role in biotechnology |journal=Journal of Biotechnology |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1016/0168-1656(94)90093-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having the ability to live in such harsh environment comes from the organisms traits and abilities that are coded into their genomes. Changes inherited over time via DNA have allowed these organisms to build up various resistances and immunities to the volatile nature of their homes.&lt;ref name = "Herbert_1992" /&gt; It is these traits that have scientists so fixated on extremophiles because the genes that allow for said abilities can be taken from extremophiles and used in various biotechnical processes. A good example of this would be how Taq Polymerase was isolated from the bacteria ''Thermus aquaticus'' and was then used to make the process of PCR possible.&lt;ref name = "Brock_1981"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brock |first=Thomas D. | name-list-format = vanc |chapter =Extreme Thermophiles of the Genera Thermus and Sulfolobus |date=1981 |title =The Prokaryotes |pages=978–984 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |isbn=9783662131893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases even the entire organism can be utilized due to how it functions in nature. A good example of this would be the use of methanogenic extremophiles to assist in the decomposition of waste. While only four major types of extremophiles are listed above, there are many more types that are not mentioned in this article.

== Importance ==
[[File:Biotechnology Research (3617772958).jpg|thumb|Scientists at a biotechnical laboratory synthesizing DNA.]]
A great deal of biological and chemical processes undertaken in laboratories take great stretches of time, are extremely delicate and tend to be costly. This is due to the fact that general biological enzymes, proteins and other various organic compounds have very specific requirements for them to function properly.&lt;ref name = "Eichler_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eichler J | title = Biotechnological uses of archaeal extremozymes | journal = Biotechnology Advances | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 261–78 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 14538076 | doi = 10.1016/s0734-9750(01)00061-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are generally moderate conditions and therefore are known as mesophilic. Catalysts  that involve changes in temperature, salinity, or acidity can impact the mesophilic organic compounds and products within a given process which in turn negatively affects the outcome. To deal with this scientists in the past have had to take longer experimental pathways in order to meet the moderate conditions. This as stated previously extends the time it takes to perform experiments and processes as well as increases costs.{{cn|date=May 2019}}
 
To overcome this issue scientists have turned to extremophiles due to their natural abilities to handle extreme conditions. These abilities are linked to genes which can be isolated, extracted and replicated in the lab.&lt;ref name = "Eichler_2001" /&gt; With this the genetic information can then be implanted in the given enzymes, polymers, proteases and other various organic compounds to give them desired resistance.&lt;ref name = "Cowan_1985" /&gt; This allows for biological and chemical processes to be completed rapidly as the careful, long winded strategies can be bypassed. Extremophiles, both themselves and their DNA, are helping scientists to optimize lengthy research techniques and processes.   

== Applications ==

=== PCR ===
[[Polymerase chain reaction|Polymerase Chain Reaction]] was developed in 1980's by the scientist [[Kary Mullis]].&lt;ref name = "Brock_1981" /&gt; Mullis would later receive the Nobel Prize for his creation of this process in 1993. This technique utilizes the heat resistant enzymes found in the thermophile ''T. aquaticus'' to rapidly and efficiently make copies of specific strands of DNA. The small sample of the target DNA is added to a test tube along with DNA primers, DNA nucleotides, Taq Polymerase, and a buffer solution.&lt;ref name = "Valones_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Valones MA, Guimarães RL, Brandão LA, de Souza PR, de Albuquerque Tavares Carvalho A, Crovela S | title = Principles and applications of polymerase chain reaction in medical diagnostic fields: a review | journal = Brazilian Journal of Microbiology | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–11 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 24031310 | pmc = 3768498 | doi = 10.1590/s1517-83822009000100001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once these five key parts are combined they can be put into a PCR thermocycler. In this device the mixture is exposed to a series of temperatures over and over again cycling between 94-95°C, 50-56°C, and 72°C. These three stages are known as the denaturing, annealing and extending stages. During the denaturing stage at 94-95°C the DNA chains separate allowing for new bonds to be made. Then during the annealing stage from 50-56°C primers attach to the single strands of DNA to prepare them for replication. Finally, the extending stage at 72°C the strands of DNA replicate as they would naturally as the DNA nucleotides are added reforming the double stranded helix.&lt;ref name = "Valones_2009" /&gt; These stages are cycled through multiple times until the desired amount of DNA is obtained. Without the enzyme produced by ''T. aquaticus'', Taq Polymerase, this process would not be possible as the components would normally denature at such high temperatures. 

=== Biofuel production ===
Fuels play a large part in everyday life in everything from driving a car and heating homes to large scale industrial processes and heavy machinery. As natural gases and fuels are being used up scientists have focused their gaze on possible replacements for said fuels. One way in which this is being done is through the utilization of various methanogenic and thermophilic strains of bacteria. These extremophiles in large quantities are able to take in various substances such as sugars, cellulose, and various waste products to produce methane, butanol and biodiesel.&lt;ref name = "Coker_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coker JA | title = Extremophiles and biotechnology: current uses and prospects | journal = F1000Research | volume = 5 | pages = 396 | date = 2016-03-24 | pmid = 27019700 | pmc = 4806705 | doi = 10.12688/f1000research.7432.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While butanol in high percentages would normally inhibit the growth and function of biological organisms, some bacterial strains, primarily thermophiles, have been engineered to handle butanol even in high concentrations. One of the more recent developments in this area is the discovery of extremophile strains of algae which can be used to produce biodiesel. ''Cyanidium caldarium'' is noted as one of the most promising strains due to the high lipid content of the biodiesel products it creates.&lt;ref name = "Coker_2016" /&gt; While this application has not yet widely developed to large scale utilization, scientists working in this field hope to find an efficient and sustainable solution involving extremophiles soon. 

=== Biomining ===
Through work with various extremophiles the technique of biomining was developed. Also known as bioleaching, the process involves the use of acidophiles in the removal of insoluble sulfides and oxides from various metals as they are mined from the earth.&lt;ref name = "Coker_2016" /&gt; The normal process of heap leaching involves mixing mined metals with highly volatile chemicals such as cyanide. The process of bioleaching is noted as a safer approach to the mining process. Along with this it is also much better for the environment. With heap leaching comes the possibility of runoff and spills that would poison the environment as it seaps into the ground. With biomining this worry is reduced as the conditions can be easily maintained using thermophilic and acidophilic strains of bacteria.&lt;ref name = "Coker_2016" /&gt;  Not only has this process been noted as safer and more environmentally friendly, but is also able to extract more metal. Heap leaching has about a 60% extraction rate while bioleaching has seen rates up to 90%.&lt;ref name = "Coker_2016" /&gt; So far gold, silver, copper, zinc, nickel, and uranium have been mined successfully using this process.

These three examples listed above are a few of the primary applications of extremophiles in biotechnology, but they are not the only ones. Other various applications that will not be fully described here include: carotenoid production, protease/lipase production, Glycosyl hydrolase production and sugar production.&lt;ref name = "Coker_2016" /&gt; These secondary applications focus on the production of biological compounds that can be used within primary applications such as those listed above.  

== Future developments ==
Thanks to the increased interest in extremophiles the revolutionary technique of PCR was pioneered and brought the field of DNA study to the next level. Following this trend scientists in both biotech and industry want to push farther and find new ways to impact the scientific community. One way that is currently being studied is the production of plastics by halophilic extremophiles so that modern day oil-based plastics can become a thing of the past.&lt;ref name = "Eichler_2001" /&gt; This would bring biodegradable plastics to the world market, which in the long run is proposed as a way to help fight the world's garbage problem. Another advancement that scientists hope to make using these organisms is to increase the degradation of landfills around the world using methanogenic species that thrive on the organic compounds found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiraldi C, Giuliano M, De Rosa M | title = Perspectives on biotechnological applications of archaea | journal = Archaea | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 75–86 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 15803645 | pmc = 2685559 | doi = 10.1155/2002/436561 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cowan_1992" /&gt; Not only would this reduce waste, but the methane produced is hoped to be collected and used as an energy source. One other interesting future development lies in the field of medicine. Some biotechnical labs are looking into using extremophiles engineered to produce portions of viruses on their surface to elicit immune system responses.&lt;ref name = "Coker_2016" /&gt; This would help train immune memory and antibody response to defend the body in case said virus ever attacks. While this is just a handful of examples there are many more advancements and developments being worked on using extremophiles in hopes of creating a better future.

'''Endothelial lipase (LIPG)''' is a form of [[lipase]] secreted by vascular [[endothelial]] cells in tissues with high metabolic rates and vascularization, such as the liver, lung, kidney, and thyroid gland.&lt;ref name="pmid28540715"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu JE, Han SY, Wolfson B, Zhou Q | title = The role of endothelial lipase in lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cancer | journal = Histology and Histopathology | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–10 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 28540715 | pmc = 5858721 | doi = 10.14670/HH-11-905 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LIPG enzyme is a vital component to many biological process.

In 1999, the identification of endothelial lipase was independently discovered by two research groups.&lt;ref name="Paradis_2006" /&gt; 

The first group at Rhone-Poulenc Rorer cloned and characterized a new member of the triacylglyerol (TG) family.  When this novel endothelial lipase was over-expressed in mice, the concentrations of HDL [[Cholesterol]] and [[apolipoprotein]] A-I in plasma decreased.&lt;ref name="Jaye_1999" /&gt;

A second group at Stanford University independently [[molecular cloning|cloned]] this same endothelial lipase from human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human coronary artery endothelial cells and rodent endothelial-like yolk sacs.&lt;ref name="Hirata_1999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirata K, Dichek HL, Cioffi JA, Choi SY, Leeper NJ, Quintana L, Kronmal GS, Cooper AD, Quertermous T | title = Cloning of a unique lipase from endothelial cells extends the lipase gene family | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 274 | issue = 20 | pages = 14170–5 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10318835 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.274.20.14170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suppression subtractive hybridization]] was used to isolate the genes.&lt;ref name="Hirata_1999" /&gt; The genes were then compared and aligned. Two cDNA fragments expressed the lipase gene and endothelial properties.&lt;ref name="Hirata_1999" /&gt; [[Northern blot]] analysis documented the samples.&lt;ref name="Hirata_1999" /&gt; The suggested relation to metabolism and vascular disease was attributed to tissue selective expression in endothelial cells.&lt;ref name="Hirata_1999" /&gt;

== Structure ==

Endothelial lipase is a protein that belongs triglyceride lipase category.&lt;ref name="pmid28540715" /&gt; This protein is encoded by the LIPG gene.&lt;ref name="pmid28540715" /&gt; Endothelial lipase is secreted from vascular endothelial cells, being the only lipase to date.&lt;ref name="Jaye_1999" /&gt; The primary secretion is that of a 55kDa protein which is secreted to a 68kDa protein after post-translational [[Glycosylation]].&lt;ref name="pmid28540715" /&gt; LIPG functions as it binds to [[Proteoglycan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name="pmid28540715" /&gt; LIPG also has the potential for additional cleavage.&lt;ref name="pmid28540715" /&gt; The additional cleavage would result in inactivity of the 40 kDa protein N-terminal 40 kDa and 28 kDa C-terminal.&lt;ref name="pmid28540715" /&gt; LIPG has the capability to form a [[protein dimer]] prior to secretion which causes dimerization to appear.&lt;ref name="pmid28540715" /&gt; The addition reaction of the same compound and molecules enhances the resistance to cleavage and limited activity is sustained.&lt;ref name="pmid28540715" /&gt;

== Biological Function ==
[[File:Hepatic lipase.jpg|thumb|304x304px|Lipid Metabolism]]

=== Metabolism ===
The site of endothelial lipase enzymatic activity is the surface of endothelial cells. LIPG regulates lipoprotein metabolism through the hydrolysis of HDL phospholipds.&lt;ref name="Darrow_2001" /&gt; This high-density lipoprotein is an [[amphipathic]] lipid, meaning the lipid is composed of both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic component.&lt;ref name="Lodish_2016"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Cell Biology|last=Lodish|first=Harvey|last2=Berk|first2=Arnold|last3=Kaiser|first3=Chris|last4=Krieger|first4=Monty|last5=Bretscher|first5=Anthony|last6=Ploegh|first6=Hidde|last7=Amon|first7=Angelika|last8=Martin|first8=Kelsey | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|year=2016|isbn=9781464183393|edition=8|location=New York|pages=273–282|oclc=1003278428}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cholesterol has a four-ring structure and is an [[isoprenoid]]-based hydrocarbon.&lt;ref name="Lodish_2016" /&gt; Although cholesterol lacks the phosphate head group, cholesterol's hydroxyl component interacts with water, categorizing cholesterol as amphipathic.&lt;ref name="Lodish_2016" /&gt; HDL cholesterol provides extreme benefits to the body and is vital in sustaining the fluidity of natural membranes.&lt;ref name="Lodish_2016" /&gt; HDL cholesterol must be maintained at a certain level to ensure normal cell growth and reproduction. The HDL capability of absorption of cholesterol and transport to the liver, aids in the removal of cholesterol in the body.&lt;ref name="CDC_2017"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/ldl_hdl.htm|title=LDL and HDL Cholesterol: "Bad" and "Good" Cholesterol|last=CDC|date=2017-10-31|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, [[Low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) cholesterol works in opposition. LDL cholesterol does not transport cholesterol out of the body but rather serves as a foundation for cholesterol buildup.&lt;ref name="CDC_2017" /&gt; LDL should be kept low in the body to avoid cholesterol buildup in arteries. When HDL are hydrolyzed, the turnover rate of HDL increases and cholesterol levels in plasma decrease.&lt;ref name="Darrow_2001" /&gt;  This hydrolysis allows for the acceleration or continuation of cholesterol removal from the body to avoid a buildup. Following the hydrolysis of HDL, free fatty acid lipid precursors are taken up.&lt;ref name="pmid28540715" /&gt; These lipids are then utilized in other phospholipid [[catabolism]].&lt;ref name="pmid28540715" /&gt; In summation, endothelial lipase is said to be a pivotal component in metabolism through high-density lipoprotein hydrolysis.

=== Vascular Biology ===
Endothelial lipase is linked to potential treatment and improvement of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a vascular disease which is caused by arterial plaque buildup.&lt;ref name="NHLBI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/atherosclerosis|title=Atherosclerosis {{!}} National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)|website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov|access-date=2019-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other components contribute to the formation of plaque in the blood.&lt;ref name="NHLBI" /&gt; Plaque is detrimental to vascular heath because it narrows and stiffens the arteries, causing a lack of oxygen-rich blood flow.&lt;ref name="NHLBI" /&gt; HDL increase serves as a treatment for atherosclerosis. The hydrolysis of HDL leads to the transportation of cholesterol to the [[liver]].&lt;ref name="CDC_2017" /&gt; The filtration system of the liver aids in the removal of cholesterol from the body. Therefore, the cholesterol level in the plasma will decrease. Thus, endothelial lipase synthesis of HDL could provide an adequate opportunity to increase HDL levels. Data suggests that endothelial lipase inhibition should increase the plasma HDL, primarily in patients with low HDL-C levels.&lt;ref name="Darrow_2001" /&gt; An increased risk of atherosclerosis is associated with low levels of HDL.&lt;ref name="Darrow_2001" /&gt; Although a functional correlation can be drawn, there is little clinical evidence to provide support to the suggested potential benefits in vascular pathophysiology.

      <text bytes="22141" xml:space="preserve">In [[biology]], '''overabundant species''' refers to an excessive number of individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/overabundant|title=overabundant {{!}} Definition of overabundant in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries |access-date=2019-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occurs when the normal population density has been exceeded. Increase in animal populations is influenced by a variety of factors, some of which include [[habitat destruction]] or augmentation by human activity, the introduction of [[invasive species]] and the reintroduction of threatened species to protected reserves.

Population overabundance can have a negative impact on the environment, and in some cases on the public as well. There are various methods through which populations can be controlled such as [[hunting]], contraception, chemical controls, disease and genetic modification. Overabundant species is an important area of research as it can potentially impact the biodiversity of ecosystems.

Most research studies have examined negative impacts of overabundant species, whereas very few have documented or performed an in-depth examination on positive impacts. As a result, this article focuses on the negative impact of overabundant species.

== Definitions ==
When referring to animals as “overabundant”, various definitions apply. The following classes&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Problems in Management of Locally Abundant Wild Mammals|last=Management of Locally Abundant Wild Mammals (Conference)|date=1982|publisher=Academic Press|oclc=941191342}}&lt;/ref&gt; explore the different associations with overabundance:

# The inconvenience of animals in a certain region or area that threatens human livelihood, for example the tropics are considered to contain an overabundant population of the ''Anopheles'' mosquito which carries the malaria parasite. 
# The population density of a preferred species has been reduced by another species population which is then considered as overabundant, for example predator populations of lions and hyenas reducing zebra and wildebeest numbers.
# A species population within a specific habitat exceeds the carrying capacity, for example national parks reducing herbivore populations to maintain and manage habitat equilibrium.
# The entire equilibrium consisting of animal and plant organisations is already out of balance, for example existing populations colonising new habitat.

Out of all these classifications, class 4 is considered the most significant due to consequent ecological impacts.

== Causes ==
Overabundance may occur naturally, for example after weather events such as a period of high rainfall&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moseby|first=K.E.|last2=Lollback|first2=G.W.|last3=Lynch|first3=C.E.|date=2018|title=Too much of a good thing; successful reintroduction leads to overpopulation in a threatened mammal|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=219|pages=78–88|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2018.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which habitat conditions become optimal. However, other contributing factors include:

=== Anthropogenic disturbances ===
Natural habitats are altered by human activity resulting in habitat fragmentation, decrease in forest densities and wild fires.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pivello|first=Vânia Regina|last2=Vieira|first2=Marcus Vinicius|last3=Grombone-Guaratini|first3=Maria Tereza|last4=Matos|first4=Dalva Maria Silva|date=2018|title=Thinking about super-dominant populations of native species – Examples from Brazil|journal=Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation|volume=16|issue=2|pages=74–82|doi=10.1016/j.pecon.2018.04.001|issn=2530-0644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other human disturbances include restrictions on hunting, agricultural land modification&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuijper|first=D. P.

=== Invasive species can be better adapted to specific environments ===
Invasive species are often overabundant as they outcompete native species for resources such as food and shelter which allows their population to thrive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Pavey, C. (2006). National Recovery Plan for the Greater Bilby Macrotis lagotis. Northern Territory Department of Natural Resources, Environment and the Arts.&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors influencing population growth include the lack of native predators&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Doherty, T., Glen, A., Nimmo, D., Ritchie, E., &amp; Dickman, C. (2016). Invasive predators and global biodiversity loss. ''Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences'', ''113''(40), 11261-11265. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1602480113}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the less common presence of the introduced species within native predator habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Overabundance due to translocation of threatened species to protected areas ===
Some methods in managing threatened species involve reintroducing species to enclosed reserves or island areas. Once these species are introduced, their populations can become overabundant as these areas serve to protect the targeted species against predators and competitors. This occurred for the ''Bettongia lesueur'', the burrowing bettong, which was reintroduced to the Arid Recovery reserve in Australia: their population has increased from 30 to approximately 1532 individuals. Due to the damage within this reserve their population is considered overabundant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{See also|Conservation Biology|}}

== Potential impacts ==
Overabundant species can have an adverse impact on ecosystems. Within ecosystems food resources and availability, competitors, and species composition can be negatively impacted on.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Impacts of overabundant herbivores ===
[[File:Koala climbing tree.jpg|thumb|Australian Koala (''Phascolarctos cinereus'')]]

A common impact from overabundant herbivores is vegetative damage by [[overgrazing]], where overgrazing refers to the effect of grazing having reached a level where other biodiversity within the ecosystem becomes threatened. Overgrazing can occur in both terrestrial and marine environments and can alter vegetation as well as the composition of vegetation. Population densities and the composition of fauna can also be negatively impacted on.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, permanent ecological damage can be caused by overgrazing before maximum carrying capacity has been reached.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Trophic relationships (i.e. feeding relationships in the ecosystem) can be altered by overabundant species, potentially causing a trophic cascade. Trophic cascades impact vegetation as well as invertebrates (including microorganisms) and birds.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, predator behaviour and populations may be indirectly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamarre|first=Jean-François|last2=Legagneux|first2=Pierre|last3=Gauthier|first3=Gilles|last4=Reed|first4=Eric T.|last5=Bêty|first5=Joël|date=May 2017|title=Predator-mediated negative effects of overabundant snow geese on arctic-nesting shorebirds|journal=Ecosphere|volume=8|issue=5|pages=e01788|doi=10.1002/ecs2.1788|issn=2150-8925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impacts of overabundant predators ===
Overabundant predators are considered harmful to local biodiversity as they prey on native species, compete for resources and can introduce disease. They can decrease native mammal populations and, in some cases, can cause species to become extinct which results in a cascading ecological impact. Examples of invasive species include: “cats (''Felis catus''), rats (''Rattus rattus''), mongoose (''Herpestes auropunctatus''), stoats (''Mustela erminea'')”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and red foxes (''Vulpes vulpes''). Such species have contributed to the extinction of approximately 58% of modern-day mammals, birds and reptiles.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In Australia, red foxes and feral cats have contributed to many native mammals becoming threatened or extinct which has led to diminished vegetation as foraging mammals have an important ecological role in maintaining a healthy landscape. A particular example is where grassland vegetation diminished to shrub land as a result of seabirds being preyed on by Arctic foxes. Seabirds have an essential ecological role which consists of helping to maintain nutrient levels and soil fertility.

“Invasive predators also threaten 596 species classed as "vulnerable" (217 species), "endangered" (223), or "critically endangered" (156), of which 23 are classed as “possibly extinct.”&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Impact on society ===
It can be very costly to control or eradicate overabundant species. For example, fencing regions as a protective measure against red foxes can cost approximately $10, 000 per kilometre while baiting an area of 35,000&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; kilometres can cost about $1.3 million.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iucngisd.org/gisd/species.php?sc=66#|title=Species profile: Vulpes vulpes|last=Global Invasive Species Database|date=2019|website=www.iucngisd.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Invasive species ==
According to biology, invasive species are non-native animals that are introduced to a region or area outside of their usual habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/ecology/community-structure-and-diversity/a/invasive-species|title=Invasive species|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2019-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invasive species can either be introduced intentionally (if they have a beneficial purpose) or non-intentionally.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Citation|last=Mollot|first=G.|title=The Effects of Invasive Species on the Decline in Species Richness|date=2017|work=Networks of Invasion: A Synthesis of Concepts|pages=61–83|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780128043387|last2=Pantel|first2=J.H.|last3=Romanuk|first3=T.N.|doi=10.1016/bs.aecr.2016.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, invasive species that become overabundant most commonly have a negative impact on local biodiversity&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; with little research having found positive effects. Furthermore, an invasive species may have an initial positive benefit that fades as the species become overabundant and the cost of damage control increases.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SAUNDERS|first=Glen R.|last2=GENTLE|first2=Matthew N.|last3=DICKMAN|first3=Christopher R.|date=2010-04-12|title=The impacts and management of foxes Vulpes vulpes in Australia|journal=Mammal Review|volume=40|issue=3|pages=181–211|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2907.2010.00159.x|issn=0305-1838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invasive species can negatively impact food web structures. In terms of trophic levels, the initial introduction of a non-native species results in a higher species richness whereby the trophic relationships are altered by the additional resource (if an animal is not a predator at the top of the food chain) and consumer. However, the consequent degree of the impact on the local ecosystem once a species becomes overabundant is case dependent as some invasive species, like the brown tree snake in Guam, have caused numerous extinctions of native fauna, while others have had fewer damaging impacts on the environment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Costs of invasive species are estimated at millions and billions each year.&lt;ref&gt;Sakai, A., Allendorf, F., Holt, J., Lodge, D., Molofsky, J., With, K., . . . Weller, S. (2001).

=== A focus on Australian Wildlife ===

==== Red fox ====
[[File:Vulpes vulpes standing.jpg|Red fox (''Vulpes vulpes'')|thumb|left]]

The [[red fox]], ''Vulpes Vulpes,'' was introduced to Australia during the 1870’s. The established population has thrived in previous years due to the following factors: adaptability to climate conditions, the ability to live in a wide range of habitats including deserts and forests, and lastly human modification of Australian landscapes which are suitable environments for red foxes to thrive in. Red foxes have mainly had a negative impact on Australian fauna, with the exception of regulated rabbit populations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The diet of red foxes include a number of threatened native fauna which has contributed to their population declines and extinctions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Furthermore, populations of native fauna, mammals in particular, have increased through fox population control techniques.

==== Rabbit ====
[[Rabbit]]s were initially introduced to Australia as pets during colonisation. Rabbits pose a threat to native herbivores as they compete for shared resources. Additionally, overgrazing and modification of habitat vegetation by rabbits allow introduced predators to thrive when hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/a-numbers-game-killing-rabbits-to-conserve-native-mammals-97078|title=A numbers game: killing rabbits to conserve native mammals|last=Fordham|first=Damien|last2=Ritchie|first2=Euan|date=July 2018|website=The Conversation|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-05-12|last3=Lurgi|first3=Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbits have thrived in Australia as they reproduce rapidly, have few predators to regulate their population and the climatic conditions is preferable, especially as the environmental conditions limit diseases that regulate rabbit populations on other continents.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, C.K., Parer, I., Coman, B.J., Burley, J. and Braysher, M.L.

== Methods for controlling overabundant species ==
There are various methods for controlling overabundant populations. Some methods have been used over many years, for example culling, while others such as immunocontraception are still being researched.

=== Culling ===
[[Culling]] refers to selective elimination of animals to decrease a population. Two ways of culling involve killing animals by hunting and translocation of animals. Culling of animals may also be an option in reserves established for specific animal conservation as a way of managing their population density, examples include: elephants and hippos.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Target animals can be hunted on the ground or culled by aerial pursuit, with the aim to eliminate the animal in one accurate hit to reduce or limit suffering before death. This method allows a large number of animals to be eliminated within a relatively short amount of time, however shots are not always accurate which can lead to the escape and suffering of individuals.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://was-research.org/paper/analysis-lethal-methods-wild-animal-population-control-vertebrates/|title=An Analysis of Lethal Methods of Wild Animal Population Control: Vertebrates|last=Esk|first=Persis|last2=er|date=2017-06-29|website=Wild-Animal Suffering Research|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baiting ===
Baiting is a common method of controlling overabundant populations, it involves the placement of lethal chemicals in food (the bait) that eliminates the animal. It is cost-effective and helps remove a large number of animals from a population,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; however if ingested by non-target animals it could potentially cause death depending on the type of bait the chemical is administered in, as well as the areas of bait placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mcilroy|first=JC|last2=Gifford|first2=EJ|date=1991|title=Effects on non-target animal populations of a rabbit trail-baiting campaign with 1080 poison|journal=Wildlife Research|volume=18|issue=3|pages=315|doi=10.1071/wr9910315|issn=1035-3712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1080 is a common chemical used in bait. 1080 once ingested causes death by inhibiting the animal's neurological functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Twigg|last2=LE|last3=Parker|last4=RW|date=2010|title=Is sodium fluoroacetate (1080) a humane poison? The influence of mode of action, physiological effects, and target specificity|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?option2=author&amp;value2=Twigg%2c+LE&amp;pageSize=10&amp;index=1|journal=Animal Welfare|publisher=Universities Federation for Animal Welfare|volume=19|pages=249–263(15)|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of an enzyme that native Australian fauna is tolerant to, however it can still be lethal if ingested. 

=== Fumigation ===
Fumigation, which involves the spreading of poisonous gas, helps to selectively kill a large number of animals. It is a method used to control rabbit and fox populations in Australia by spraying a lethal chemical into warrens and dens. Chemicals used include phosphine for rabbits and carbon monoxide for foxes, both of which induce suffering prior to death.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Difficulties with fumigation include pinpointing individual dens and warrens, which can be both time-consuming and hard work, as well as the restricted time period during which animals regularly inhabit their dens, for example during spring when offspring are born.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Disease ===
This method is used on select animals and is species specific, such as to control the rabbit population in Australia. It involves spreading a disease, for example "rabbit calicivirus disease",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pech|first=R. P.|last2=Hood|first2=G. M.|date=1998|title=Foxes, rabbits, alternative prey and rabbit calicivirus disease: consequences of a new biological control agent for an outbreaking species in Australia|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=434–453|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2664.1998.00318.x|issn=0021-8901}}&lt;/ref&gt; through bait or through capture and release programs. The aim is to have the disease spread through the targeted species population to reduce their numbers. Death may take up to 1 or 2 weeks in which the animal suffers from symptoms such as fever, loss of appetite and lethargy.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Contraception ===
Two methods for managing fertility in overabundant wildlife include the employment of biotechnology such as immunocontraception, and surgery to neuter males or spay females.  There are various factors that impact the effectiveness of contraceptive methods, some of which include: expense, longevity of the treatment effect, level of difficulty in administering the treatment, and whether or not the method has a negative impact on the individual or other species in the environment.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adderton|first=HC|date=2004|title=Long-acting contraceptives: a new tool to manage overabundant kangaroo populations in nature reserves and urban areas..|journal=Australian Mammalogy|volume=26|issue=1|pages=67|doi=10.1071/am04067|issn=0310-0049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an immune-contraceptive is gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). Studies have been conducted on various animals, for example white-tailed deer and cats, of which have shown that GnRH can be effective in reducing short term fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Immunocontraception of White-Tailed Deer with GnRH Vaccine|last=Miller, Lowell A. Johns, Brad E. Killian, Gary J.|date=2000-04-26|publisher=DigitalCommons@University of Nebraska - Lincoln|oclc=749806237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=Julie K.|last2=Friary|first2=John A.|last3=Miller|first3=Lowell A.|last4=Tucker|first4=Sylvia J.|last5=Fagerstone|first5=Kathleen A.|date=2011|title=Long-term fertility control in female cats with GonaCon™, a GnRH immunocontraceptive|journal=Theriogenology|volume=76|issue=8|pages=1517–1525|doi=10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.06.022|pmid=21835455|issn=0093-691X|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2332&amp;context=icwdm_usdanwrc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Immunocontraception ====
Immunocontraception causes animals to become infertile which helps to control and reduce overabundant populations. Two methods of administration include vaccines and chemical implants. In some studies immunocontraception has shown to effectively reduce pregnancy rates, however this method is both time consuming and expensive due to further research required to overcome challenges such as longevity of the contraceptive effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hardy|first=C.M.|last2=Hinds|first2=L.A.|last3=Kerr|first3=P.J.|last4=Lloyd|first4=M.L.|last5=Redwood|first5=A.J.|last6=Shellam|first6=G.R.|last7=Strive|first7=T.|date=2006|title=Biological control of vertebrate pests using virally vectored immunocontraception|journal=Journal of Reproductive Immunology|volume=71|issue=2|pages=102–111|doi=10.1016/j.jri.2006.04.006|pmid=16870262|issn=0165-0378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Surgery ====
This method can be effective in small populations as it is fairly accessible, however the procedure is costly, invasive as well as the individual being at risk of infection after surgery. Surgical sterilisation is permanent, as a result it may not be appropriate for use in native populations due to the risk of potentially losing genetic variation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

      <text bytes="4914" xml:space="preserve">The '''photothermal ratio''' (PTR), also named '''photothermal quotient''',  is a variable that characterizes the amount of light available to plants relative to the temperature level. It is used in plant biology to characterize the growth environment of plants.&lt;ref name="Pessarakli 2016 p. 176"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pessarakli |first=M. |title=Handbook of Cucurbits: Growth, Cultural Practices, and Physiology |publisher=CRC Press |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4822-3459-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnGmCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176 |access-date=4 July 2019 |page=176 |quote=The combined effects of light and air temperature (photothermal ratio) (Wang et al., 2014) clearly indicated that the total number of female nodes significantly increase by high photothermal ratio, and this is opposite for the number of male ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==
Both light and temperature are important environmental variables that determine the growth and development of plants. Light is especially important in driving photosynthesis and producing sugars. Temperature is a strong driver of cell division, where available sugars are converted to produce new leaf, stem, root or reproductive biomass. As such, both are important factors – along with nutrient and water availability – in determining the source:sink balance of a plant, the amount of sugar available for  plant in relation to its growth potential. The photothermal ratio is a quantitative descriptor that can be used to approximate this balance.

== Calculation and units ==
The  photothermal ratio is calculated by dividing the [[Daily Light Integral]] ([[Photosynthetically active radiation|photosynthetic photon flux density]] integrated over a day; DLI) plants are exposed to by a baseline daily temperature(T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;). PTR = DLI / T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;. Units are therefore mol quanta m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; °C&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Alternatively, the number of [[degree days]] have been used rather than T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; per se, with units of the form mol degree-day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Liu&amp;Heins2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Bin |last2=Heins |first2=Royal D. |title=Photothermal Ratio Affects Plant Quality in 'Freedom' Poinsettia |journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science |date=2002 |volume=127 |issue=1 |pages=20–26 |doi=10.21273/JASHS.127.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PTR concept has been introduced in detailed studies of growth and productivity of a particular species. For these species, a baseline temperature T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is chosen for which it is known than no leaf elongation takes place below that temperature, which for many temperate species will be a temperature around 5&amp;nbsp;°C.

In characterizing the growth environment of a broad range of plants without reference to any specific species, T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; has been taken to be zero °C.&lt;ref name="Poorteretal2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poorter |first1=Hendrik |last2=Fiorani |first2=Fabio |last3=Pieruschka |first3=Roland |last4=Wojciechowski |first4=Tobias |last5=van der Putten |first5=Wim H. |last6=Kleyer |first6=Michael |last7=Schurr |first7=Uli |last8=Postma |first8=Johannes |title=Pampered inside, pestered outside?

== Normal ranges ==
The photothermal ratio is relatively constant over the year in the tropics, with lowland values around 1.3&amp;nbsp;mol m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; °C&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. At higher latitudes PTR changes with seasons, being high in spring, and low in autumn. Averaged over the growing season, PTR values are around 3 in boreal zones, and around 2 in temperate zones. Plants growing in glasshouses often grow at a PTR of ~1, experiments with Arabidopsis are often carried out at a PTR around 0.2.&lt;ref name="Poorteretal2016" /&gt;

== Effects on plants ==
Many effects that have been ascribed to light are actually dependent on temperature as well. For example, strong [[Plant development|stem elongation]] at low light will only take place when temperatures are high, but not when temperatures are close to 0&amp;nbsp;°C. In [[wheat]], PTR in the month before anthesis strongly determines the number of kernels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fischer |first1=R. A. |title=Number of kernels in wheat crops and the influence of solar radiation and temperature |journal=The Journal of Agricultural Science |date=1985 |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=447–461 |doi=10.1017/S0021859600056495}}&lt;/ref&gt; In horticulture, plants grown at a high PTR generally have thicker stems, shorter internodes and more flowers, and therefore have higher marketable yield.&lt;ref name="Liu&amp;Heins2002" /&gt;

'''Construction costs''' is a concept in biology that conveys how much [[glucose]] is required to construct a unit of plant biomass, given the biosynthetic pathways and starting from glucose and mineral constituents. It includes the sugars required to provide the C-skeletons for the formation of e.g. lipids, lignin and proteins, but also the glucose required to produce energy ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]) and reducing power ([[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NAD(P)H]]) to drive the [[metabolic pathways]].

== Rationale ==
The concept of construction costs comes from [[microbiology]], when studying the different metabolic pathways that [[heterotrophic]] microorganisms use for producing biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tamiya |first1=H |title=Zur Theorie des respiratorischen Quotienten nebst einer Bemerkung über den Einfluß der oxydoreduktiven Zellvorgänge auf den Gaswechsel der Zellen |journal=Acta Phytochimica |date=1932 |volume=6 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently been used by plant biologists to calculate how much glucose would be required to build leaves, stems and roots.&lt;ref name="Penningetal1974"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penning de Vries |first1=Frits W.T. |last2=Brunsting |first2=A.H.M. |last3=Van Laar |first3=H.H. |title=Products, requirements and efficiency of biosynthesis a quantitative approach |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=45 |issue=2 |date=June 1974 |pages=339–377 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(74)90119-2|pmid=4367755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The metabolic costs to maintain cells or organs are generally not included in these estimates.

An interesting new perspective was taken by plant ecologists who calculated the pay-back time of leaves, the time required for a leaf to fix as much C as it has cost to construct that leaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=Kimberlyn |last2=Field |first2=Christopher B. |last3=Mooney |first3=Harold A. |title=Relationships Among Leaf Construction Cost, Leaf Longevity, and Light Environment in Rain-Forest Plants of the Genus Piper |journal=The American Naturalist |date=February 1989 |volume=133 |issue=2 |pages=198–211 |doi=10.1086/284910}}&lt;/ref&gt; For plants to be successful, pay-back time should be shorter than average leaf longevity, otherwise the plant is having a negative C-balance and losing out on its investments. In the end, leaves generally can only function with stems that help expose leaves to the light, and roots that take up the necessary nutrients and water. The concept of pay-back time can therefore also be applied fruitfully to whole plants. Pay-back time then approaches the [[doubling time]] of biomass, or, in other words, the relative growth rate of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Poorter |first1=Hendrik |editor1-last=Roy |editor1-first=Jacques |editor2-last=Garnier |editor2-first=Eric |title=A whole-plant perspective on Carbon-Nitrogen interactions |publisher=SPB Academic Publishing |isbn=978-9051030860 |pages=111–127 |chapter=Construction costs and payback time of biomass: A whole plant perspective|year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Units and measurements ==
The unit of construction costs is g g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; (g glucose required / g biomass produced). Theoretically, if the biochemical pathways to construct all of the thousands of different compounds of an organism would be known, as well as the concentrations of all those compounds, construction costs could be simply calculated as the product of concentration and construction costs, summed over all constituents present. However, as there are so many different compounds, this is not really feasible. Alternatively, chemical constituents can be grouped in a number of groups with relatively similar construction costs per unit compound. These groups and their estimated construction costs are given in the table below. Using approaches to determine the concentrations of these groups of compounds then enables calculation of plant organs construction costs. 
The construction costs given in the table are strongly related to the [[oxidation state]] of these compounds. That is: highest construction costs are for highly reduced compounds like [[lipids]] and [[lignin]], lowest for highly oxidized organic compounds such as [[organic acids]], and for the [[minerals]]. This is the basis for short-cut methods that estimate construction costs on the basis of [[elemental analysis|elemental composition]] or [[heat of combustion|energy content]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vertregt |first1=N. |last2=Penning de Vries |first2=F.W.T. |title=A rapid method for determining the efficiency of biosynthesis of plant biomass |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |date=September 1987 |volume=128 |issue=1 |pages=109–119 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(87)80034-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Griffin |first1=K. L. |title=Calorimetric Estimates of Construction Cost and Their use in Ecological Studies |journal=Functional Ecology |date=1994 |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=551–562 |doi=10.2307/2389915|jstor=2389915 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lafitte |first1=H.R. |last2=Loomis |first2=R.S. |title=Calculation of Growth Yield, Growth Respiration and Heat Content of Grain Sorghum from Elemental and Proximal Analyses |journal=Annals of Botany |date=1988 |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=353–361 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a087667}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be less precise, but do not require extended measurements of the proximate chemical composition. Consequence of using shortcut methods is that less insight is obtained as to the underlying reasons why construction costs differ between organisms.

== Normal values ==
Generally, construction costs of leaves are in the order of 1.3 – 1.7 g g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, with slightly lower values for stems and roots.&lt;ref name="Poorter&amp;Villar1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Poorter |first1=Hendrik |last2=Villar |first2=Rafael |editor1-last=Bazzaz |editor1-first=Fakhri |editor2-last=Grace |editor2-first=John |title=Plant Resource Allocation |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego |isbn=9780120834907 |pages=39–72 |date=1997 |chapter=The fate of acquired C in plants}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that across most vegetative plant tissue there is a strong negative correlation between the level of – expensive - protein and the level of – expensive- lignin, and a strong positive correlation between protein and the concentration of – cheap - minerals. Seeds and fruits may have very high concentrations of sugars, or of protein, and/or lipids, and therefore show a much wider range in construction costs (1.1 - 2.3 g g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

Pay-back time of leaves vary from a few days for fast-growing herbaceous species under optimal conditions, to three months or more for plants growing in low-light environments.&lt;ref name="Poorter2006" /&gt;

== Environmental effects ==
Although concentrations of chemical constituents change with the environment, the effects on leaf chemical composition are general small. Leaves of plants grown at elevated CO2 may have a few percent higher construction costs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poorter |first1=H. |last2=Van Berkel |first2=Y. |last3=Baxter |first3=R. |last4=Den Hertog |first4=J. |last5=Dijkstra |first5=P. |last6=Gifford |first6=R.

C. |title=The effect of elevated CO2 on the chemical composition and construction costs of leaves of 27 C3 species |journal=Plant, Cell and Environment |date=1997 |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=472–482 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-3040.1997.d01-84.x|hdl=1874/13536 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as do leaves that have been growing at higher [[Daily light integral|light intensities]].&lt;ref name="Poorter2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poorter |first1=Hendrik |last2=Pepin |first2=Steeve |last3=Rijkers |first3=Toon |last4=de Jong |first4=Yvonne |last5=Evans |first5=John R. |last6=Körner |first6=Christian |title=Construction costs, chemical composition and payback time of high- and low-irradiance leaves |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |date=2006 |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=355–371 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erj002|pmid=16303828 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functional groups ==
Differences in leaf construction costs between [[deciduous]] and [[evergreen]] species are small,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Villar |first1=Rafael |last2=Merino |first2=José |title=Comparison of leaf construction costs in woody species with differing leaf life-spans in contrasting ecosystems |journal=New Phytologist |date=2001 |volume=151 |pages=213–226 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2001.00147.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so are the differences between inherently fast- and slow-growing herbaceous species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poorter |first1=H. |last2=Bergkotte |first2=M. |title=Chemical composition of 24 wild species differing in relative growth rate |journal=Plant, Cell and Environment |date=1992 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=221–229 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-3040.1992.tb01476.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old age''' refers to ages nearing or surpassing the life expectancy of human beings, and is thus the end of the human [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]. Terms and euphemisms include '''old people''', '''the elderly''' (worldwide usage), '''seniors''' (American usage), '''senior citizens''' (British and American usages), '''older adults''' (in the social sciences&lt;ref&gt;''Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th edition'' (American Psychological Association, 2009) {{ISBN|1433805618}}{{page needed|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and '''the elders''' (in many cultures—including the cultures of aboriginal people).

Old people often have limited regenerative abilities and are more susceptible to disease, syndromes, injuries and sickness than younger adults. The organic process of [[ageing]] is called [[senescence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/senescence |title=Senescence – definition of senescence by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the medical study of the aging process is called [[gerontology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gerontology |title=Gerontology – definition of gerontology by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is called [[geriatrics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/geriatrics |title=Geriatrics – definition of geriatrics by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elderly also face other social issues around [[retirement]], [[loneliness]], and [[ageism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24572231 |title=Jeremy Hunt highlights plight of 'chronically lonely' – BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= 2013-10-18|accessdate=2016-04-04|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old age is not a definite biological stage, as the chronological age denoted as "old age" varies culturally and historically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198568506.001.0001/acref-9780198568506-e-4834?rskey=7F4W2c&amp;result=4834 |title=Old age |publisher=Oxford Reference |accessdate=2016-04-04|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198568506.001.0001 |year=2006 |isbn=9780198568506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[United Nations]] proposed a human rights convention that would specifically protect older persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/OlderPersons/Pages/OlderPersonsIndex.aspx|title=Human rights of older persons|website=OHCHR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions of old age include official definitions, sub-group definitions, and four dimensions as follows.

===Official definitions===
Old age comprises "the later part of life; the period of life after youth and middle age . . ., usually with reference to deterioration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://0-www.oed.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/view/Entry/258473?redirectedFrom=old+age&amp; |title=Millennium Web Catalog |publisher=0-www.oed.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At what age old age begins cannot be universally defined because it differs according to the context. The United Nations has agreed that 65+ years may be usually denoted as old age&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageingdefnolder/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Definition of an older or elderly person |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is the first attempt at an international definition of old age. However, for its study of old age in Africa, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) set 55 as the beginning of old age. At the same time, the WHO recognized that the developing world often defines old age, not by years, but by new roles, loss of previous roles, or inability to make active contributions to society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageing_mds_report_en_daressalaam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Most developed Western countries set the age of 60 to 65 for retirement. Being 60–65 years old is usually a requirement for becoming eligible for senior social programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/health/medicare-insurance/info-04-2011/medicare-eligibility.html|title=Medicare Eligibility Requirements – How to Qualify for Medicare – AARP Everyw...|last=Barry|first=Patricia|website=AARP|access-date=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, various countries and societies consider the onset of old age as anywhere from the mid-40s to the 70s.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Editors |first=The |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/426737/old-age |title=old age |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definitions of old age continue to change especially as life expectancy in developed countries has risen to beyond 80 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/centers/columbia-aging/about-us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212141539/http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/centers/columbia-aging/about-us |archivedate=December 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016, a paper published in the science journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' presented the conclusion that the maximum [[Ageing|human lifespan]] is an average age of 115, with an absolute upper limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name="NAT-20151005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dong |first1=Xiao |last2=Milholland |first2=Brandon |last3=Vijg |first3=Jan |title=Evidence for a limit to human lifespan |date=October 5, 2016 |doi=10.1038/nature19793 |volume=538 |issue=7624 |journal=Nature |pages=257–259 |pmid=27706136|bibcode=2016Natur.538..257D }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the authors' methods and conclusions drew criticism from the scientific community, who concluded that the study was flawed.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Santen|first1=Hester|title=Peer review post-mortem: how a flawed aging study was published in Nature|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/12/09/how-weak-science-slipped-past-through-review-and-landed-in-a-top-journal-a1535637|accessdate=11 December 2016|publisher=NRC|date=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-group definitions{{anchor|Third age}}&lt;!--[[Third age (retirement)]] redirects here--&gt;===
Gerontologists have recognized the very different conditions that people experience as they grow older within the years defined as old age. In developed countries, most people in their 60s and early 70s are still fit, active, and able to care for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 607.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after 75, they will become increasingly [[Frailty syndrome|frail]], a condition marked by serious mental and physical debilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Frailty in Older Adults |journal=JAMA |volume=296 |issue=18 |pages=2280 |doi=10.1001/jama.296.18.2280 |pmid = 17090776|year=2006 |last1=Torpy |first1=Janet M. |last2=Lynm |first2=Cassio |last3=Glass |first3=Richard M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, rather than lumping together all people who have been defined as old, some gerontologists have recognized the diversity of old age by defining sub-groups. One study distinguishes the young old (60 to 69), the middle old (70 to 79), and the very old (80+).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1727842|year=1992|author1=Forman|first1=D.

Y.|doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.1992.tb01823.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study's sub-grouping is young-old (65 to 74), middle-old (75–84), and oldest-old (85+).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/gerona/gln045|pmid=19213852|title=Total Water Intakes of Community-Living Middle-Old and Oldest-Old Adults|journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences|volume=64A|issue=4|pages=481–486|year=2009|last1=Zizza|first1=C. A.|last2=Ellison|first2=K. J.|last3=Wernette|first3=C. M.|pmc=2657166}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third sub-grouping is "young old" (65–74), "old" (74–84), and "old-old" (85+).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transgenerational.org/aging/demographics.htm |title=Demographics of Aging |publisher=Transgenerational.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing sub-groups in the 65+ population enables a more accurate portrayal of significant life changes.&lt;ref&gt;Victor G. Cicirelli, ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' (Springer, 2002), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two British scholars, Paul Higgs and Chris Gilleard, have added a "fourth age" sub-group. In British English, the "third age" is "the period in life of active retirement, following middle age".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', s.v. "third age".&lt;/ref&gt; Higgs and Gilleard describe the fourth age as "an arena of inactive, unhealthy, unproductive, and ultimately unsuccessful ageing".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Higgs and Chris Gilleard, ''Rethinking Old Age: Theorizing the Fourth Age'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), vii, 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dimensions===
''Key Concepts in Social Gerontology'' lists four dimensions: chronological, biological, psychological, and social.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Judith, Kristine Ajrouch, and Sarah Hillcoat-Nallétamby, ''Key Concepts in Social Gerontology'' (SAGE Publications, 2010), 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Wattis and Curran add a fifth dimension: developmental.&lt;ref&gt;John Wattis, Stephen Curran, ''Practical Psychiatry of Old Age'' (Radcliffe Publishing, 2006). 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Chronological age may differ considerably from a person's functional age. The distinguishing marks of old age normally occur in all five senses at different times and different rates for different persons.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010319220229/http://ohioline.osu.edu/ss-fact/0101.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to chronological age, people can be considered old because of the other dimensions of old age. For example, people may be considered old when they become grandparents or when they begin to do less or different work in retirement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt;

===Senior citizen===
Senior citizen is a common euphemism for an old person used in [[American English]], and sometimes in [[British English]]. It implies that the person being referred to is retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl |title=Oxford Learner's Dictionaries &amp;#124; Find the meanings, definitions, pictures, pronunciation of words at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com |publisher=Oup.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/36/S0263600.html|title=Bartleby.com: Great Books Online – Quotes, Poems, Novels, Classics and hundreds more|accessdate=12 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420174106/http://www.bartleby.com/61/36/S0263600.html|archivedate=20 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chambersharrap.co.uk/chambers/features/chref/chref.py/main?query=senior+citizen&amp;title=21st |title=www.chambersharrap.co.uk |publisher=www.chambersharrap.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=71747&amp;dict=CALD |title=senior citizen Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=2016-03-30 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn usually implies that the person is over the [[retirement age]], which varies according to country. Synonyms include '''old age pensioner''' or '''pensioner''' in British English, and '''retiree''' and '''senior''' in American English. Some dictionaries describe widespread use of "senior citizen" for people over the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/senior-citizen |title=senior citizen – Definition from Longman English Dictionary Online |publisher=Ldoceonline.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When defined in an official context, ''senior citizen'' is often used for legal or policy-related reasons in determining who is eligible for certain benefits available to the age group.

It is used in general usage instead of traditional terms such as ''old person'', ''old-age pensioner'', or ''elderly'' as a courtesy and to signify continuing relevance of and respect for this population group as "[[citizen]]s" of society, of ''senior'' rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waughfield|first1=Claire G.|last2=Burckhalter|first2=Teresa S.|title=Mental health concepts|date=2002|publisher=Delmar/Thomson Learning|location=Clifton Park, NY|isbn=9780766838307|page=[https://archive.org/details/mentalhealthconc0000waug/page/64 64]|edition=5th|url=https://archive.org/details/mentalhealthconc0000waug|url-access=registration|accessdate=4 April 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was apparently coined in 1938 during a political campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theseniortimes.com/richler.htm|title=The Senior Times Online|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famed caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]] claimed on several occasion that his father Isaac Hirschfeld invented the term 'senior citizen'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zIgT8dfbX1wC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=al+hirschfeld+father+coined+senior+citizen#v=onepage&amp;q=al%20hirschfeld%20father%20coined%20senior%20citizen&amp;f=false | title=Hirschfeld: On Line | publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books | page=10 | date=February 1, 2000| accessdate=December 19, 2015| isbn=9781557833563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| people = Al Hirschfeld| title = The Line King: The Al Hirschfeld Story | medium = VHS| publisher = Cabin Fever Entertainment| date = 1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,417721,00.html | title=That Old Feeling: The Fun in Al Hirschfeld | journal=Time | author=Richard Corliss | date=January 29, 2003| accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has come into widespread use in recent decades in legislation, commerce, and common speech. Especially in less formal contexts, it is often abbreviated as "senior(s)", which is also used as an [[adjective]].

In commerce, some businesses offer customers of a certain age a "[[senior discount]]". The age at which these discounts are available varies between 55, 60, 62 or 65, and other criteria may also apply. Sometimes a special "[[senior discount card]]" or other proof of age needs to be obtained and produced to show entitlement.

====Age qualifications====

The age which qualifies for senior citizen status varies widely. In governmental contexts, it is usually associated with an age at which [[pension]]s or medical benefits for the elderly become available. In commercial contexts, where it may serve as a [[marketing]] device to attract customers, the age is often significantly lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahn Shin-Hyun |url=http://www.seriworld.org/01/wldContVod.html?mn=A&amp;mncd=0301&amp;sort=A&amp;gubun=00&amp;p_page=65&amp;natcd=KR&amp;key=20110404000005 |title=Economic Report |publisher=SERIWorld |date=2011-04-04 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the standard retirement age is currently 66 (gradually increasing to 67).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/planners/retire/ageincrease.html |title=Retirement Age Calculator |publisher=Ssa.gov |date=2014-09-03 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the OAS (Old Age Security) pension is available at 65 (the Conservative government of Stephen Harper had planned to gradually increase the age of eligibility to 67, starting in the years 2023–2029, although the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau is considering leaving it at 65),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/isp/oas/changes/index.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102073722/http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/isp/oas/changes/index.shtml |archivedate=November 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CPP (Canada Pension Plan) as early as age 60.

The [[AARP]] allows couples in which one spouse has reached the age of 50 to join, regardless of the age of the other spouse.

==Signs==
{{See also|Ageing#Effects}} 

The distinguishing characteristics of old age are both physical and mental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1891555|year=1991|author1=Salokangas|first1=R. K.|title=Physical and mental health changes in retirement age|journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics|volume=55|issue=2–4|pages=100–107|last2=Joukamaa|first2=M|doi=10.1159/000288415}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marks of old age are so unlike the marks of middle age that legal scholar Richard Posner suggests that, as an individual transitions into old age, he/she can be thought of as different persons "time-sharing" the same identity.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''Aging and Old Age'' (University of Chicago, 1997), 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

These marks do not occur at the same chronological age for everyone. Also, they occur at different rates and order for different people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; Marks of old age can easily vary between people of the same chronological age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.qld.gov.au/resources/communityservices/seniors/publications/ageing-myth-reality.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 19, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216170927/http://www.communities.qld.gov.au/resources/communityservices/seniors/publications/ageing-myth-reality.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A basic mark of old age that affects both body and mind is "slowness of behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.46.020195.001553|pmid=7872732|title=Aging and Speed of Behavior: Possible Consequences for Psychological Functioning|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=46|pages=329–353|year=1995|last1=Birren|first1=J E|last2=Fisher|first2=L M}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "slowing down principle" finds a correlation between advancing age and slowness of reaction and physical and mental task performance.&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Kausler and Barry C. Kausler, ''The Graying of America: An Encyclopedia of Aging, Health, Mind, and Behavior'' (University of Illinois, 2001), 376–377.&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies from Buffalo University and Northwestern University have shown that the elderly are a happier age group than their younger counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/04/24/health/old-people-happy/ |title=Older people are happier than you. Why?|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2015-04-24 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical===
Physical marks of old age include the following:

*Bone and joint. Old bones are marked by "thinning and shrinkage". This might result in a loss of height (about two&amp;nbsp;inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) by age 80), a stooping posture in many people, and a greater susceptibility to bone and joint diseases such as [[osteoarthritis]] and [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name="wahsa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wahsa.org/agingprocess.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030211939/http://wahsa.org/agingprocess.pdf |archivedate=October 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="documbase1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.documbase.com/The-Normal-Aging-Process.pdf |title=The Normal Aging Process  |publisher=Documbase.com |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health/osteoporosis-diagnosis#Overview1|title=Osteoporosis Tests and Diagnosis|publisher=Healthline|date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chronic diseases. Some older persons have at least one [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic condition]] and many have multiple conditions. In 2007–2009, the most frequently occurring conditions among older persons in the United States were uncontrolled [[hypertension]] (34%), diagnosed arthritis (50%), and heart disease (32%).&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoa.gov/Aging_Statistics/Profile/2011/docs/2011profile.pdf|title=Administration on Aging&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|access-date=2014-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010053036/http://www.aoa.gov/Aging_Statistics/Profile/2011/docs/2011profile.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-10|url-status=dead|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH) "defined as coughing and bringing up [[sputum]] . . . is a common respiratory symptom in elderly persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Determinants of prognosis of COPD in the elderly: mucus hypersecretion, infections, cardiovascular comorbidity &amp;#124; European Respiratory Society |journal=European Respiratory Journal |volume=21 |pages=10s–14s |date=2003-05-01 |doi=10.1183/09031936.03.00403403 |last1=Pistelli |first1=R. |last2=Lange |first2=P. |last3=Miller |first3=D.L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dental problems. May have less [[saliva]] and less ability for [[oral hygiene]] in old age which increases the chance of [[Dental caries|tooth decay and infection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/helping-your-elder-with-grooming-and-hygiene.html |title=Helping Your Elder with Grooming and Hygiene – For Dummies |publisher=Dummies.com |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Digestive system. About 40% of the time, old age is marked by digestive disorders such as difficulty in swallowing, inability to eat enough and to absorb nutrition, constipation and bleeding.
*[[Essential tremor]] (ET) is an uncontrollable shaking in a part of the upper body. It is more common in the elderly and symptoms worsen with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/essential-tremor-basics |title=Essential Tremor: Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment |publisher=Webmd.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Eyesight. [[Presbyopia]] can occur by age 50 and it hinders reading especially of small print in low lighting. Speed with which an individual reads and the ability to locate objects may also be impaired.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/aging/resources/guides/older.aspx|title=Older Adults' Health and Age-Related Changes}}&lt;/ref&gt; By age 80, more than half of all Americans either have a [[cataract]] or have had [[cataract surgery]].&lt;ref name=NIH2009&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Cataract|url=https://www.nei.nih.gov/health/cataract/cataract_facts|accessdate=14 August 2016|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf.

*Gait change. Some aspects of [[Gait (human)|gait]] normally change with old age. Gait velocity slows after age 70.

===Mental===
Mental marks of old age include the following:

*Adaptable describes most people in their old age. Despite the stressfulness of old age, they are described as "agreeable" and "accepting". However, old age dependence induces feelings of incompetence and worthlessness in a minority.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 608–609.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Caution marks old age. This antipathy toward "risk-taking" stems from the fact that old people have less to gain and more to lose by taking risks than younger people.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''Aging and Old Age'' (University of Chicago, 1995), 112, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Depressed mood.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy G.J. The epidemiology of late-life depression. In: Kennedy G. J, editor. ''Suicide and depression in late life: Critical issues in treatment, research and public policy''. New York: John Wiley and Sons; 1996. pp. 23–37.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cox, [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012), old age is a risk factor for depression caused by prejudice (i.e., "deprejudice"). When people are prejudiced against the elderly and then become old themselves, their anti-elderly prejudice turns inward, causing depression. "People with more negative age stereotypes will likely have higher rates of depression as they get older."&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1745691612455204|title=Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume=7|issue=5|pages=427–449|year=2012|last1=Cox|first1=W.

Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 610.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fear of crime in old age, especially among the frail, sometimes weighs more heavily than concerns about finances or health and restricts what they do. The fear persists in spite of the fact that old people are victims of crime less often than younger people.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 617.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increasing fear of health loss.
*Mental disorders afflict about 15% of people aged 60+ according to estimates by the World Health Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs381/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Mental health and older adults |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey taken in 15 countries reported that mental disorders of adults interfered with their daily activities more than physical problems.&lt;ref name="Laura E.

*Set in one's ways describes a mind set of old age.&lt;ref&gt;George P. Moschis, ''Marketing to Older Consumers'' (Praeger, 1992), 102.&lt;/ref&gt; A study of over 400 distinguished men and women in old age found a "preference for the routine".&lt;ref&gt;Martin S. Lindauer, ''Aging, Creativity, and Art'' (Springer, 2003), 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations include old age's toll on the "fluid intelligence" and the "more deeply entrenched" ways of the old.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''Aging and Old Age'' (University of Chicago, 1995), 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==

===Middle-age===
Many books by middle-age writers depict their perceptions of old people.&lt;ref&gt;''How to Survive Your Aging Parents'' (Surrey, 2001); ''Are Your Parents Driving You Crazy?'' (Vanderwyk &amp; Burnham, 2005); ''Coping With Your Difficult Older Parent: A Guide for Stressed-Out Children'' (William Morrow, 1999); ''Caring for Yourself While Caring for Your Aging Parents: How to Help, How to Survive'' (Holt, 2005); ''The Caregiver's Survival Handbook: Caring for Your Aging Parents Without Losing Yourself'' (Perigee, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; One writer notices the change in his parents: they move slowly, they have lost strength, they repeat stories, their minds wander, and they fret.&lt;ref&gt;David Solie, ''How to Say It to Seniors: Closing the Communication Gap with Our Elders'' (Prentice Hall, 2004), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer sees her aged parents and is bewildered: they refuse to follow her advice, they are obsessed with the past, they avoid risk, they live at a "glacial pace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matthiessen |first=Connie |url=http://www.caring.com/articles/elderly-communication |title=Elderly Communication &amp;#124; Communicating with Stubborn Elderly Parents |publisher=Caring.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers treat the perceptions of middle-age people regarding their own old age. In her ''The Denial of Aging'', Dr. Muriel R. Gillick, a [[Baby boomers|baby boomer]], accuses her contemporaries of believing that by proper exercise and diet they can avoid the scourges of old age and proceed from middle age to death.&lt;ref&gt;Gillick, ''The Denial of Aging: Perpetual Youth, Eternal Life, and Other Dangerous Fantasies'' (Harvard, 2007), 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies find that many people in the 55–75 range can postpone morbidity by practicing healthy lifestyles. These discourses take part in a general idea of [[successful ageing]]. However, at about age 80, all people experience similar morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;Waneen Wyrick Spirduso, Karen L. Francis, Priscilla G. MacRae, ''Physical Dimensions of Aging'' (Human Kinetics, 2004), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Even with healthy lifestyles, most 85+ people will undergo extended "frailty and disability".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Jacoby, ''Never Say Die: The Myth and Marketing of the New Old Age'' (Pantheon, 2011), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old-age===
Early old age is a pleasant time; children are grown, retirement from work, time to pursue interests.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'' (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 603.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people are also willing to get involved in community and [[Activist ageing|activist organizations]] to promote their well-being. In contrast, perceptions of old age by writers 80+ years old (old age in the real meaning of the term&lt;ref name="Tor Inge Romoren 2003"/&gt;) tend to be negative.

{{illm|Georges Minois|WD=Q921484}} writes that the first man to talk about his old age was an Egyptian scribe who lived 4,500 years ago. The scribe addressed God with a prayer of lament:&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;O Sovereign my Lord!  Oldness has come; old age has descended. Feebleness has arrived; dotage is here anew. The heart sleeps wearily every day.&lt;br/&gt; The eyes are weak, the ears are deaf, the strength is disappearing because of weariness of the heart and the mouth is silent and cannot speak.&lt;br/&gt; The heart is forgetful and cannot recall yesterday. The bone suffers old age. Good is become evil. All taste is gone. What old age does to men is evil in every respect.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989) Minois, 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Minois comments that the scribe's "cry shows that nothing has changed in the drama of decrepitude between the age of the Pharaoh and the atomic age" and "expresses all the anguish of old people in the past and the present".&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989)  Minois, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lillian B. Rubin|Lillian Rubin]], active in her 80s as an author, sociologist, and psychotherapist, opens her book ''60 on Up: The Truth about Aging in America'' with "getting old sucks. It always has, it always will." Dr. Rubin contrasts the "real old age" with the "rosy pictures" painted by middle-age writers.&lt;ref&gt;Lillian B. Rubin, ''60 on Up: The Truth About Aging in America'' (Beacon, 2007), 1, 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing at the age of 87, Mary C. Morrison describes the heroism required by old age: to live through the disintegration of one's own body or that of someone you love. Morrison concludes, "old age is not for the fainthearted."&lt;ref&gt;Mary C. Morrison, ''Let Evening Come'' (1998), 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Life Beyond 85 Years'', the 150 interviewees had to cope with physical and mental debilitation and with losses of loved ones. One interviewee described living in old age as "pure hell".&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' (Prometheus, 2003), 7–8, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Societal===
Based on his survey of old age in history, [[:fr:Georges Minois|Georges Minois]] concludes that "it is clear that always and everywhere youth has been preferred to old age." In Western thought, "old age is an evil, an infirmity and a dreary time of preparation for death." Furthermore, death is often preferred over "decrepitude, because death means deliverance".&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989)  Minois, 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The problem of the ambiguity of old age has . . . been with us since the stage of primitive society; it was both the source of wisdom and of infirmity, experience and decrepitude, of prestige and suffering."&lt;ref name="Georges Minois 1989"&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989)  Minois, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]] of Greek and Roman cultures, old age was denigrated as a time of "decline and decrepitude".&lt;ref&gt;Susan M. Hillier and Georgia M. Barrow, ''Aging, The Individual &amp; Society'' (Cengage, 10th edition, 2014), 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; "Beauty and strength" were esteemed and old age was viewed as defiling and ugly. Old age was reckoned as one of the unanswerable "great mysteries" along with evil, pain, and suffering. "Decrepitude, which shrivels heroes, seemed worse than death."&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medieval and Renaissance periods depicted old age as "cruel or weak".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Susan M. Hillier and Georgia M. Barrow, ''Aging, The Individual &amp; Society'' (Cengage, 10th edition, 2014), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical periods reveal a mixed picture of the "position and status" of old people, but there has never been a "golden age of aging".&lt;ref name="Susan M 2014"&gt;Susan M. Hillier and Georgia M. Barrow, ''Aging, The Individual &amp; Society'' (Cengage, 10th edition, 2014), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have disproved the popular belief that in the past old people were venerated by society and cared for by their families.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson and [[Pat Thane]], editors, ''Old Age from Antiquity to Post-Modernity'' (Routledge, 1998), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Veneration for and antagonism toward the aged have coexisted in complex relationships throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/old-age |title=The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions |publisher=Answers |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Old people were respected or despised, honoured or put to death according to circumstance."&lt;ref name="Georges Minois 1989"/&gt;

In ancient times, although some strong and healthy people lived until they were over 70 most died before they were 50. The general understanding is that those who lived into their 40s were treated with respect and awe. In contrast, those who were frail were seen as a burden and ignored or in extreme cases killed.&lt;ref name="Susan M 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GuqFh1Ff3rgC&amp;dq=ancient%20%20old%20age%20Most%20people%20died%20before%20they%20were%20%2050|title=The Oxford Handbook of Retirement|first=Mo|last=Wang|date=8 November 2012|publisher=OUP USA|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199746521}}&lt;/ref&gt; People were defined as "old" because of their inability to perform useful tasks rather than their years.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson and [[Pat Thane]], editors, ''Old Age from Antiquity to Post-Modernity'' (Routledge, 1998), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] did not like old people." Their youth rebelled against the old, driving them off or killing them.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was skeptical of the gods, [[Aristotle]] concurred in the dislike of old people. In his ''Ethics'', he wrote that "old people are miserly; they do not acknowledge disinterested friendship; only seeking for what can satisfy their selfish needs."&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th-century Utopians, [[Thomas More]] and [[Antonio de Guevara]], allowed no decrepit old people in their fictional lands.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Minois, ''History of Old Age: From Antiquity to the Renaissance'', trans. Sarah Hanbury Tenison  (University of Chicago Press, 1989), 277–278, 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Thomas More, on the island of [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]], when people are so old as to have "out-lived themselves" and are terminally ill, in pain, and a burden to everyone, the priests exhort them about choosing to die. The priests assure them that "they shall be happy after death." If they choose to die, they end their lives by starvation or by taking opium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/Utopia_T.pdf|title=Utopia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio de Guevara]]'s utopian nation "had a custom, not to live longer than sixty five years". At that age, they practiced self-immolation. Rather than condemn the practice, Bishop Guevara called it a "golden world" in which people "have overcome the natural appetite to desire to live".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015002444985 |title=The diall of princes: by Don Anthony of Guevara: tr. by Sir Thomas ... – Full View &amp;#124; HathiTrust Digital Library &amp;#124; HathiTrust Digital Library |publisher=Babel.hathitrust.org |date=2012-08-18 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Modern period, the "cultural status" of old people has declined in many cultures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Joan Erikson]] observed that "aged individuals are often ostracized, neglected, and overlooked; elders are seen no longer as bearers of wisdom but as embodiments of shame."&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on age-related attitudes consistently finds that negative attitudes exceed positive attitudes toward old people because of their looks and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Birren and K Warner Schaie, eds., ''Handbook of the Psychology of Aging'' (Academic, 2011), 253.&lt;/ref&gt; In his study ''Aging and Old Age'', Posner discovers "resentment and disdain of older people" in American society.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, ''Aging and Old Age'' (University of Chicago, 1997), 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard University's [[implicit-association test]] measures implicit "attitudes and beliefs" about Young vis a vis Old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/selectatest.html |title=ProjectImplicit |publisher=Implicit.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blind Spot: Hidden Biases of Good People'', a book about the test, reports that 80% of Americans have an "automatic preference for the young over old" and that attitude is true worldwide. The young are "consistent in their negative attitude" toward the old.&lt;ref&gt;Mahzarin R. Banaji and Anthony G. Greenwald, ''Blind Spot: Hidden Biases of Good People'' (Random House, 2013), 67.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ageism'' documents that Americans generally have "little tolerance for older persons and very few reservations about harboring negative attitudes" about them.&lt;ref&gt;Todd D. Nelson, ed, ''Ageism: Stereotyping and Prejudice Against Older Persons'' (Bradford, 2004), ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its prevalence, [[ageism]] is seldom the subject of public discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Judith E Phillips and others, ''Key Concepts in Social Gerontology'' (Sage, 2010), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a documentary film called ''[[The Age of Love (2014 film)|The Age of Love]]'' used humor and poignant adventures of 30 seniors who attend a speed dating event for 70- to 90-year-olds, and discovered how the search for romance changes; or does not change; from a [[childhood sweetheart]] to older age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |first=Writer |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/feb/02/documentary-tracks-seniors-in-search-of-love/ |title=Documentary tracks seniors in search of love |work=The Spokesman-Review |date=2015-02-02 |accessdate=2015-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simulated===
[[Simone de Beauvoir]] wrote that "there is one form of experience that belongs only to those that are old – that of old age itself."&lt;ref&gt;Simone de Beauvoir, ''The Coming of Age'', trans by Patrick O'Brian (Norton, 1996), 381.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, simulations of old age attempt to help younger people gain some understanding.

Texas A&amp;M University offers a plan for an "Aging Simulation" workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension, "Aging Simulation: Sensitizing People to the Process of Aging" online at
http://fcs.tamu.edu/files/2015/06/aging-simulation.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop is adapted from ''Sensitizing People to the Processes of Aging''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensitizing People to the Processes of Aging: The In-Service Educator's Guide'' by Marvin Ernst and Herbert Shore, Dallas Geriatric Research Institute, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the simulations follow:
:* Sight: Wearing swimmer's goggles with black paper pasted to lens with only a small hole to simulate tunnel vision, 
:* Hearing: Use ear plugs to dull the sound of people talking. 
:* Touch: Wearing thick gloves, button a shirt or buckle a belt.
:* Dexterity: With tape around several fingers, unscrew a jar lid.
:* Mobility and Balance: Carry packages in one hand while using a walker.

The Macklin Intergenerational Institute conducts Xtreme Aging workshops, as depicted in ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/us/03aging.html|title=Simulating Age 85, With Lessons on Offering Care|date=3 August 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A condensed version was presented on

On set #1, write your 5 most enjoyed activities; on set #2, write your 5 most valued possessions; on set #3, write your 5 most loved people. Then "lose" them one by one, trying to feel each loss, until you have lost them all as happens in old age.

==Frailty==
[[File:Blake London.jpg|thumb| An image of an elderly man being guided by a young child accompanies [[William Blake]]'s poem ''[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]'', from his ''[[Songs of Innocence and Experience]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.blakearchive.org/exist/blake/archive/object.xq?objectid=songsie.aa.illbk.46&amp;java=yes | title = Songs of Innocence and of Experience, object 46 (Bentley 46, Erdman 46, Keynes 46) "LONDON" | editors = Morris Eaves, Robert N.

Most people in the age range of 60–80 (the years of retirement and early old age), enjoy rich possibilities for a full life, but the condition of [[Frailty syndrome|frailty]] distinguished by "bodily failure" and greater dependence becomes increasingly common after that.&lt;ref name="Tor Inge Romoren 2003"&gt;Tor Inge Romoren, ''Last Years of Long Lives: The Larvik Study'' (Routledge, 2003), 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, hospital discharge data from 2003 to 2011 shows that injury was the most common reason for hospitalization among patients aged 65+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Weiss AJ, Barrett ML, Andrews RM | title =  Trends and Projections of U.S. Hospital Costs by Payer, 2003–2013 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #176 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = July 2014 | url = http://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb176-Hospital-Cost-Projections-by-Age-2013.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerontology|Gerontologists]] note the lack of research regarding and the difficulty in defining frailty. However, they add that physicians recognize frailty when they see it.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, editor, ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), xxi, 4, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of [[Geriatrics|geriatricians]] proposed a general definition of frailty as "a physical state of increased vulnerability to stressors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/stressors |title=Stressors &amp;#124; definition of stressors by Medical dictionary |publisher=Medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that results from decreased reserves and disregulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/dysregulation |title=Dysregulation Medical Definition &amp;#124; Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in multiple physiological systems".&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, ed., ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frailty is a common condition in later old age 
but different definitions of frailty produce diverse assessments of prevalence. One study placed the incidence of frailty for ages 65+ at 10.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1532-5415.2012.04054.x|pmid=22881367|title=Prevalence of Frailty in Community-Dwelling Older Persons: A Systematic Review|journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society|volume=60|issue=8|pages=1487–92|year=2012|last1=Collard|first1=Rose M.|last2=Boter|first2=Han|last3=Schoevers|first3=Robert A.|last4=Oude Voshaar|first4=Richard C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study placed the incidence of frailty in age 65+ population at 22% for women and 15% for men.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel R. Gillick M.D., ''Choosing Medical Care in Old Age: What Kind, How Much, When to Stop'' (Harvard, 1998), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian study illustrated how frailty increases with age and calculated the prevalence for 65+ as 22.4% and for 85+ as 43.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/741960 |title=Prevalence of Frailty Increases Throughout Adulthood |publisher=Medscape.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A worldwide study of "patterns of frailty" based on data from 20 nations found (a) a consistent correlation between frailty and age, (b) a higher frequency among women, and (c) more frailty in wealthier nations where greater support and medical care increases longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075847|pmid=24204581|title=Patterns of Frailty in Older Adults: Comparing Results from Higher and Lower Income Countries Using the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE)|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=10|pages=e75847|year=2013|last1=Harttgen|first1=Kenneth|last2=Kowal|first2=Paul|last3=Strulik|first3=Holger|last4=Chatterji|first4=Somnath|last5=Vollmer|first5=Sebastian|bibcode=2013PLoSO...875847H|pmc=3812225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, a 20-year longitudinal study of 400 people found that bodily failure and greater dependence became prevalent in the 80+ years. The study calls these years the "fourth age" or "old age in the real meaning of the term". Similarly, the "Berlin Aging Study" rated over-all functionality on four levels: good, medium, poor, and very poor. People in their 70s were mostly rated good. In the 80–90 year range, the four levels of functionality were divided equally. By the 90–100 year range, 60% would be considered frail because of very poor functionality and only 5% still possessed good functionality.&lt;ref name="Tor Inge Romoren 2003"/&gt;

In the United States, the 85+ age group is the fastest growing, a group that is almost sure to face the "inevitable decrepitude" of survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' (Prometheus, 2003), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; (Frailty and decrepitude are synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.yourdictionary.com/frailty |title=Another word for frailty &amp;#124; Synonyms for frailty |publisher=Thesaurus.yourdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Markers===
Three unique markers of frailty have been proposed: (a) loss of any notion of invincibility, (b) loss of ability to do things essential to one's care, and (c) loss of possibility for a subsequent life stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Nortin-M.-Hadler/e/B001ITYO36 |title=Nortin M. Hadler: Books, Biography, Blog, Audiobooks, Kindle |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Old age survivors on-average deteriorate from agility in their 65–80s to a period of frailty preceding death. This deterioration is gradual for some and precipitous for others. Frailty is marked by an array of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] physical and mental problems which means that frailty is not treatable as a specific disease. These problems coupled with increased dependency in the [[Basic activities of daily living|basic activities of daily living (ADLs)]] required for personal care add emotional problems: depression and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel R. Gillick, ''Lifelines: Living Longer, Growing Frail, Taking Heart'' (Norton, 2001), x, xv–xvi, 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, frailty has been depicted as a group of "complex issues," distinct but "causally interconnected," that often include "comorbid diseases",&lt;ref&gt;"diseases in addition to the primary disease"&lt;/ref&gt; progressive weakness, stress, exhaustion, and depression.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, ed., ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misconceptions===
Johnson and Barer did a pioneering study of  ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' by interviews over a six-year period. In talking with 85-year-olds and older, they found some popular conceptions about old age to be erroneous. Such erroneous conceptions include (1) people in old age have at least one family member for support, (2) old age well-being requires social activity, and (3) "successful adaptation" to age-related changes demands a continuity of self-concept. In their interviews, Johnson and Barer found that 24% of the 85+ had no face-to-face family relationships; many have outlived their families. Second, that contrary to popular notions, the interviews revealed that the reduced activity and socializing of the over-85s does not harm their well-being; they "welcome increased detachment". Third, rather than a continuity of self-concept, as the interviewees faced new situations they changed their "cognitive and emotional processes" and reconstituted their "self–representation".&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' (Prometheus, 2003), 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Care and costs===
[[File:Altenpflege 02.jpg|thumb|upright|The hand of an elderly person]]
[[File:On Lok Senior Health Services day care program, 1970's.jpg|thumb|right|Women at the On Lok Senior Health Services day care program in San Francisco, late 1970s.]]
Frail people require a high level of care. Medical advances have made it possible to "postpone death" for years. This added time costs many frail people "prolonged sickness, dependence, pain, and suffering".&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, editor, ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the rate of emergency department visits was consistently highest among patients ages 85 years and older in 2006–2011 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Skiner HG, Blanchard J, Elixhauser A | title =  Trends in Emergency Department Visits, 2006–2011 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #179 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = September 2014 | url = https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb179-Emergency-Department-Trends.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, patients aged 65+ had the highest percentage of hospital stays for adults with multiple chronic conditions but the second highest percentage of hospital costs in 2003–2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Steiner CA, Barett ML, Weiss AJ, Andrews RM | title =  Trends and Projections in Hospital Stays for Adults With Multiple Chronic Conditions, 2003–2014 | work = HCUP Statistical Brief #183 | publisher = Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality | location = Rockville, MD | date = November 2014 | url =https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb183-Hospitalizations-Multiple-Chronic-Conditions-Projections-2014.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These final years are also costly in economic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Logue 1994, ''Last Rights: Death Control and the Elderly in America'' (Lexington Books/Macmillan, 1993), 17–18, 92.&lt;/ref&gt; One out of every four Medicare dollars is spent on the frail in their last year of life . . . in attempts to postpone death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Penelope Wang |url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/11/pf/end-of-life-care-duplicate-2.moneymag/ |title=Cutting the High Cost of End-of-Life Care &amp;#124; TIME |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2012-12-12 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical treatments in the final days are not only economically costly, they are often unnecessary, even harmful.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Wang, "Cutting the high cost of end-of-life care" (CNNMoney, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Nortin Hadler, M.D. warns against the tendency to medicalize and overtreat the frail.&lt;ref&gt;Nortin M. Hadler, ''Rethinking Aging: Growing Old and Living Well in an Overtreated Society'' (University of North Carolina, 2011) 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In her ''Choosing Medical Care in Old Age'', Michael R. Gillick M.D. argues that appropriate medical treatment for the frail is not the same as for the robust. The frail are vulnerable to "being tipped over" by any physical stress put on the system such as medical interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel R. Gillick M.D., ''Choosing Medical Care in Old Age: What Kind, How Much, When to Stop'' (Harvard, 1998), 116, 189,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Old age, death, and frailty are linked because approximately half the deaths in old age are preceded by months or years of frailty.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, ed., ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 3, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Older Adults' Views on Death'' is based on interviews with 109 people in the 70–90 age range, with a mean age of 80.7. 
Almost 20% of the people wanted to use whatever treatment that might postpone death. About the same number said that, given a terminal illness, they would choose assisted suicide. Roughly half chose doing nothing except live day by day until death comes naturally without medical or other intervention designed to prolong life. This choice was coupled with a desire to receive palliative care if needed.&lt;ref&gt;Victor G. Cicirelli, ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' (Springer, 2002), 6–7, 9, 12, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

About half of older adults suffer multimorbidity, that is, they have three or more chronic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/geriatric_medicine_gerontology/aging_research/health_services_research/multimorbidity.html |title=Multimorbidity &amp;#124; Johns Hopkins Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology |publisher=Hopkinsmedicine.org |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical advances have made it possible to "postpone death," but in many cases this postponement adds "prolonged sickness, dependence, pain, and suffering," a time that is costly in social, psychological, and economic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Logue, ''Last Rights: Death Control and the Elderly in America'' (Lexington Books/Macmillan, 1993), 18, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The longitudinal interviews of 150 age 85+ people summarized in ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' found "progressive terminal decline" in the year prior to death: constant fatigue, much sleep, detachment from people, things, and activities, simplified lives. Most of the interviewees did not fear death; some would welcome it. One person said, "Living this long is pure hell."
However, nearly everyone feared a long process of dying. Some wanted to die in their sleep; others wanted to die "on their feet".&lt;ref&gt;Colleen Johnson and Barbara M. Barer, ''Life Beyond 85 Years'' (Prometheus, 2003), 202–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of  ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' found that the more frail people were, the more "pain, suffering, and struggles" they were enduring, the more likely they were to "accept and welcome" death as a release from their misery. Their fear about the process of dying was that it would prolong their distress. Besides being a release from misery, some saw death as a way to reunion with departed loved ones. Others saw death as a way to free their caretakers from the burden of their care.&lt;ref&gt;Victor G. Cicirelli, ''Older Adults' Views on Death'' (Springer, 2002) 55, 270, 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religiosity==
Generally speaking, old people have always been more religious than young people.&lt;ref&gt;https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/57193/Davie%20Progress%20Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, wide cultural variations exist.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 608.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the United States, 90% of old age Hispanics view themselves as very, quite, or somewhat religious.&lt;ref name="Melvin A. Kimble 1995"&gt;Melvin A. Kimble, Susan H. McFadden, James W. Ellor, eds.,''Aging, Spirituality, and Religion: A Handbook'', Vol 1 (Fortress, 1995), 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Research Center's study of black and white old people found that 62% of those in ages 65–74 and 70% in ages 75+ asserted that religion was "very important" to them. For all 65+ people, more women (76%) than men (53%) and more blacks (87%) than whites (63%) consider religion "very important" to them. This compares to 54% in the 30–49 age range.&lt;ref name="pewsocialtrends1"&gt;http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2010/10/Getting-Old-in-America.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In a British 20-year longitudinal study, less than half of the old people surveyed said that religion was "very important" to them, and a quarter said they had become less religious in old age.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010). 608.&lt;/ref&gt; The late-life rise in religiosity is stronger in Japan than in the United States, but in the Netherlands it is minimal.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In the practice of religion, a study of 60+ people found that 25% read the Bible every day and over 40% look at religious TV.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin A. Kimble, Susan H. McFadden, James W. Ellor, eds.,''Aging, Spirituality, and Religion: A Handbook'', Vol 1 (Fortress, 1995), 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Pew Research found that in the age 65+ range, 75% of whites and 87% of blacks pray daily.&lt;ref name="pewsocialtrends1"/&gt;

Participation in organized religion is not a good indicator of religiosity because transportation and health problems often hinder participation.&lt;ref name="Melvin A. Kimble 1995"/&gt;

==Demographic changes==
In the industrialized countries, life expectancy and, thus, the old age population have increased consistently over the last decades.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus08.pdf#026 |title=Table 26: Life expectancy at birth, at 65 years of age, and at 75 years of age by race and sex: United States, selected years, 1900 – 2005|date= |website= |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States the proportion of people aged 65 or older increased from 4% in 1900 to about 12% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-12.pdf|title=Census 2000 Brief, C2KBR/01-12, U.S.|publisher=Census Bureau|location=Washington, DC|accessdate=2009-03-17|last=Meyer|first=Julie|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900, only about {{Nowrap|3 million}} of the nation's citizens were 65 or older (out of 76 million total American citizens). By 2000, the number of senior citizens had increased to about 35 million (of 280 million US citizens). Population experts estimate that more than {{Nowrap|50 million}} Americans—about 17 percent of the population—will be 65 or older in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agingstats.gov/Main_Site/Data/2012_Documents/Population.aspx |title=Older Americans 2012: Key Indicators of Well-Being |publisher=Agingstats.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313055028/http://agingstats.gov/main_site/data/2012_documents/population.aspx |archivedate=2016-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2050, it is projected that at least 400,000 Americans will be 100 or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/08/06/living-to-120-and-beyond-americans-views-on-aging-medical-advances-and-radical-life-extension/ |title=Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' Views on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension &amp;#124; Pew Research Center |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2013-08-06 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of old people is growing around the world chiefly because of the [[post–World War II baby boom]] and increases in the provision and standards of health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/worldageing19502050/ |title=World Population Ageing |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2050, 33% of the developed world's population and almost 20% of the less developed world's population will be over 60 years old.&lt;ref&gt;John Bond and others, editors, ''Ageing in Society'' (Sage, 2007 3rd ed), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing number of people living to their 80s and 90s in the developed world has strained public welfare systems and has also resulted in increased incidence of diseases like cancer and dementia that were rarely seen in premodern times. When the United States Social Security program was created, persons older than 65 numbered only around 5% of the population and the average life expectancy of a 65-year-old in 1936 was approximately 5 years, while in 2011 it could often range from 10 to 20 years. Other issues that can arise from an increasing population are growing demands for health care and an increase in demand for different types of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v66n1/v66n1p1.html |title=Social Security: A Program and Policy History |publisher=Ssa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2202/1941-6008.1011|title=Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations|journal=Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology|volume=1|year=2007|last1=De Grey|first1=Aubrey D.N.J|citeseerx=10.1.1.395.745}}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

==Psychosocial aspects==
[[File:BuddhistMonk02.jpg|thumb|upright|An elderly [[Khmer people|Khmer]] woman]]
According to [[Erik Erikson]]'s [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|"Stages of Psychosocial Development"]], the human personality is developed in a series of eight stages that take place from the time of birth and continue on throughout an individual's complete life. He characterises old age as a period of "Integrity vs. Despair", during which a person focuses on reflecting back on his life. Those who are unsuccessful during this phase will feel that their life has been wasted and will experience many regrets. The individual will be left with feelings of bitterness and despair. Those who feel proud of their accomplishments will feel a sense of integrity. Successfully completing this phase means looking back with few regrets and a general feeling of satisfaction. These individuals will attain wisdom, even when confronting death.&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, E.H. (1968). ''Identity: Youth and Crisis''. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, E.H. (1963). ''[[Childhood and Society]]''. (2nd ed.). New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carver, C.S. &amp; Scheir, M.F. (2000). ''Perspectives on Personality''. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon&lt;/ref&gt; Coping is a very important skill needed in the aging process to move forward with life and not be 'stuck' in the past. The way a person adapts and copes, reflects his aging process on a psycho-social level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ot.creighton.edu/community/OT_FOR_ELDERS/3rd_Edition_Chapters/Proofs/Padilla_Chapter_04_main.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219021259/http://ot.creighton.edu/community/OT_FOR_ELDERS/3rd_Edition_Chapters/Proofs/Padilla_Chapter_04_main.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For people in their 80s and 90s, [[Joan Erikson]] added a ninth stage in ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version''.&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; As she wrote, she added the ninth stage because the Integrity of the eighth stage imposes "a serious demand on the senses of elders" and the Wisdom of the eighth stage requires capacities that ninth stage elders "do not usually have".&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, Joan M. Erikson, ''The Life Cycle Completed: Extended Version'' (W. W. Norton, 1998), 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman &amp; Newman also proposed a ninth stage of life, Elderhood. Elderhood refers to those individuals who live past the life expectancy of their birth cohorts. There are two different types of people described in this stage of life.  The "young old" are the healthy individuals who can function on their own without assistance and can complete their daily tasks independently. The "old old" are those who depend on specific services due to declining health or diseases. This period of life is characterized as a period of "immortality vs. extinction". Immortality is the belief that your life will go on past death, some examples are an afterlife or living on through one's family. Extinction refers to feeling as if life has no purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Newman, Philip R. Newman, ''Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach: A Psychosocial Approach'' (Cengage Learning, 2011), Ch 13 "Later Adulthood (60–75 Years)" and Ch 14, "Elderhood (75 until death)".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories===
[[File:Habibaadansalat.jpg|thumb|An elderly [[Somali people|Somali]] woman]]
[[File:Walking style of an aged woman on road.jpg|thumb|An elderly woman walks down a road]]
Social theories, or concepts,&lt;ref&gt;"Theory: A conception . . . of something to be done, or of the method of doing it." ''Oxford English Dictionary Online ''. December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; propose explanations for the distinctive relationships between old people and their societies.

One of the theories is the [[disengagement theory]] proposed in 1961. This theory proposes that in old age a mutual disengagement between people and their society occurs in anticipation of death. By becoming disengaged from work and family responsibilities, according to this concept, people are enabled to enjoy their old age without stress.
This theory has been subjected to the criticism that old age disengagement is neither natural, inevitable, nor beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/an-overview-of-cumming-and-henrys-social-disengagement-theory-3750/&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, disengaging from social ties in old age is not across the board: unsatisfactory ties are dropped and satisfying ones kept.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 613.&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the disengagement theory, the [[activity theory (aging)|activity theory]] of old age argues that disengagement in old age occurs not by desire, but by the barriers to social engagement imposed by society. This theory has been faulted for not factoring in psychological changes that occur in old age as shown by reduced activity, even when available. It has also been found that happiness in old age is not proportional to activity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 614.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[continuity theory]], in spite of the inevitable differences imposed by their old age, most people try to maintain continuity in personhood, activities, and relationships with their younger days.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Socioemotional selectivity theory]] also depicts how people maintain continuity in old age. The focus of this theory is continuity sustained by social networks, albeit networks narrowed by choice and by circumstances. The choice is for more harmonious relationships. The circumstances are loss of relationships by death and distance.&lt;ref&gt;Laura E. Berk, ''Development Through the Lifespan'', (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 2010), 614–615.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life expectancy==
[[Life expectancy]] by nation at birth in the year 2011 ranged from 48 years to 82. Low values indicate high death rates for infants and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/2.21 |title=World Development Indicators &amp;#124; The World Bank |publisher=Wdi.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most parts of the world women live, on average, longer than men; even so, the disparities vary between 12 years in Russia to no difference or higher life expectancy for men in countries such as Zimbabwe and Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;de Blij, Harm. The power of place. Geography, Destiny, and Globalization's Rough Landscape. [[Oxford University Press]]. London:2009. p161ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of elderly persons worldwide began to surge in the second half of the 20th century. Up to that time (and still true in underdeveloped countries), five or less percent of the population was over 65. Few lived longer than their 70s and people who attained advanced age (i.e. their 80s) were rare enough to be a novelty and were revered as wise sages. The worldwide over-65 population in 1960 was one-third of the under 5 population. By 2013, the over-65 population had grown to equal the under 5 population. The over-65 population is projected to double the under five by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/ageing/publications/global_health.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the surge in the over-65 population, accidents and disease claimed many people before they could attain old age, and health problems in those over 65 meant a quick death in most cases. If a person lived to an advanced age, it was due to genetic factors and/or a relatively easy lifestyle, since diseases of old age could not be treated before the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, scientists identified the maximum [[Ageing|human lifespan]] at an average age of 115, with an absolute upper limit of 125 years.&lt;ref name="NAT-20151005"/&gt; However, the concept of a maximum lifespan in humans is still widely debated among the scientific community.&lt;ref name="NYT-20161005"&gt;{{cite news |last=Zimmer |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Zimmer |title=What's the Longest Humans Can Live? 115 Years, New Study Says |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/science/maximum-life-span-study.html |date=October 5, 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=October 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
German chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] created the world's first comprehensive government [[social safety net]] in the 1880s, providing for old age pensions.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt;

In the [[Social Security (United States)|United States of America]], and the [[Pensions in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], 65 (UK 60 for women) was traditionally the age of retirement with full old age benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Old-Age+Benefits |title=Old-Age Benefits legal definition of Old-Age Benefits |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date=2013-05-23 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thisismoney1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/pensions/article-1679780/New-state-pension-age-retire.html |title=New state pension age: when will you retire? |publisher=This is Money |date=2016-03-10 |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the age at which a United States citizen became eligible for full Social Security benefits began to increase gradually, and will continue to do so until it reaches 67 in 2027. Full retirement age for Social Security benefits for people retiring in 2012 is age 66.&lt;ref name="socialsecurity.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/retirechart.htm |title=Age To Receive Full Social Security Retirement Benefits|date= |website= |publisher=[[Social Security Administration|U.S. Social SecurityAdministration]]|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the state pension age for men and women will rise to 66 in 2020 with further increases scheduled after that."&lt;ref name="thisismoney1"/&gt;

Originally, the purpose of old age pensions was to prevent elderly persons from being reduced to beggary, which is still common in some underdeveloped countries, but growing life expectancies and older populations have brought into question the model under which pension systems were designed.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Schulz and Robert H. Binstock, Aging Nation: The Economics and Politics of Growing Older in America (Johns Hopkins, 2008). 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, the United States was spending 30 per cent of its budget on the elderly, compared with 2 per cent on education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = U.S. spending|date = April 19, 1990|work = [[Rolling Stone]]|access-date = |via = |page = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dominant perception of the American old age population changed from "needy" and "worthy" to "powerful" and "greedy," old people getting more than their share of the nation's resources.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Katz Olson, ''The Not-so-golden Years: Caregiving, the Frail Elderly, and the Long-term Care Establishment'' (Rowman and Littlefield, 2003), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2011, using a Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), the old age American poverty rate was measured as 15.9%.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

==Assistance: devices and personal==
[[File:Altenpflege 04.jpg|thumb|A [[Walker (mobility)|walker]] in the apartment of a senior woman]]
In the United States in 2008, 11 million people aged 65+ lived alone: 5 million or 22% of ages 65–74, 4 million or 34% of ages 75–84, and 2 million or 41% of ages 85+. The 2007 gender breakdown for all people 65+ was men 19% and women 39%.&lt;ref&gt;http://longevity3.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/New-Realities-of-an-Older-America.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many new assistive devices made especially for the home have enabled more old people to care for themselves [[activities of daily living]] (ADL). Able Data&lt;ref&gt;Maintained for the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research of the U.S. Dept. of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; lists 40,000 assistive technology products in 20 categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abledata.com/abledata.cfm?pageid=19327&amp;ksectionid=19327 |title=Welcome to |publisher=AbleData |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of devices are a medical alert and safety system, shower seat (making it so the person does not get tired in the shower and fall), a bed cane (offering support to those with unsteadiness getting in and out of bed) and an ADL cuff (used with eating utensils for people with paralysis or hand weakness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/elderly/english/healthinfo/elderly/assistivedevices-e.htm |title=Elderly Health Service |accessdate=December 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831094556/http://www.info.gov.hk/elderly/english/healthinfo/elderly/assistivedevices-e.htm |archivedate=August 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Swedish study found that at age 76, 46% of the subjects used assistive devices. When they reached age 86, 69% used them. The subjects were ambivalent regarding the use of the assistive devices: as "enablers" or as "disablers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Use of assistive devices – a reality full of contradictions in elderly persons' everyday life|first1=Greta|last1=Häggblom-Kronlöf|first2=Ulla|last2=Sonn|date=1 January 2007|volume=2|issue=6|pages=335–345|doi=10.1080/17483100701701672|journal=[[Disability and Rehabilitation: Assistive Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who view assistive devices as enabling greater independence accept and use them. Those who see them as symbols of disability reject them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homemods.org/resources/pages/accept.shtml |title=Home Modifications |publisher=Homemods.org |date= |accessdate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[organization]]s like [[Love for the Elderly]] aim to combat such age-related prejudice by educating the public about the importance of appreciating growing older, while also providing services of kindness to elders in senior homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lovefortheelderly.org/|title=Love for the Elderly|website=Love for the Elderly|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with assistive devices as of 2006, 8.5 million Americans needed personal assistance because of impaired [[basic activities of daily living]] required for personal care or impaired [[instrumental activities of daily living]] (IADL) required for independent living. Projections place this number at 21 million by 2030 when 40% of Americans over 70 will need assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Burbank, editor, ''Vulnerable Older Adults: Health Care Needs and Interventions'' (Springer, 2006), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many options for such long term care to those who require it. There is [[home care]] in which a family member, volunteer, or trained professional will aid the person in need and help with daily activities. Another option is community services which can provide the person with transportation, meal plans, or activities in [[senior centers]]. A third option is [[assisted living]] where 24-hour round-the-clock supervision is given with aid in eating, bathing, dressing, etc. A final option is a [[nursing home]] which provides professional nursing care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/44363-LTC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Synthetic microbial consortia''' (commonly called co-cultures) are multi-population systems that can contain a diverse range of microbial species, and are adjustable to serve a variety of industrial, ecological, and tautological{{Clarify|date=October 2019}} interests.  For [[synthetic biology]], consortia take the ability to engineer novel cell behaviors to a population level.

W.|last3=Silver|first3=Pamela A.|last4=Ducat|first4=Daniel C.|date=2017-01-23|title=Synthetic photosynthetic consortia define interactions leading to robustness and photoproduction |journal=Journal of Biological Engineering|volume=11|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.1186/s13036-017-0048-5 |pmc=5259876|pmid=28127397}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commensal combination of the sucrose-producing cyanobacteria with the modified ''E. coli'' metabolism may allow for a diverse array of metabolic products such as various butanol biofuels, terpenoids, and fatty-acid derived fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kang|first=Aram|last2=Lee|first2=Taek Soon|date=2015-10-27|title=Converting Sugars to Biofuels: Ethanol and Beyond |journal=Bioengineering|volume=2|issue=4|pages=184–203|doi=10.3390/bioengineering2040184 |pmc=5597089|pmid=28952477}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including a heterotroph also provides a solution to the issues of contamination when producing carbohydrates, as competition may limit contaminant species viability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In isolated systems this can be a restriction to the feasibility of large-scale biofuel operations, like algae ponds, where contamination can significantly reduce the desired output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McBride |first1=Robert C. |last2=Lopez |first2=Salvador |last3=Meenach |first3=Chris |last4=Burnett |first4=Mike |last5=Lee |first5=Philip A. |last6=Nohilly |first6=Fiona |last7=Behnke |first7=Craig |title=Contamination Management in Low Cost Open Algae Ponds for Biofuels Production |journal=Industrial Biotechnology |date=June 2014 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=221–7 |doi=10.1089/ind.2013.0036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through interactions between ''[[Geobacter]]'' ''spp.'' and [[Methanogen]]s from the soil in a rice paddy field, it was discovered that the use of interspecies electron transfer stimulated the production of methane.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kato |first1=Souichiro |last2=Hashimoto |first2=Kazuhito |last3=Watanabe |first3=Kazuya |title=Methanogenesis facilitated by electric syntrophy via (semi)conductive iron-oxide minerals |journal=Environmental Microbiology |date=July 2012 |volume=14 |issue=7 |pages=1646–54 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02611.x |pmid=22004041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Considering the abundance of conductive metals in soils and the use of [[Methane]] (natural gas) as a fuel, this may lead to a bioenergy-producing process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Bioremediation==
Use of the extensive range of microbial metabolism offers opportunities to those interested in [[Bioremediation]]. Through consortia, synthetic biologists have been able to design an enhanced efficiency in bacteria that can excrete bio-surfactants as well as degrade hydrocarbons for the interests of cleaning oil contamination in Assam, India.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patowary|first=Kaustuvmani|last2=Patowary|first2=Rupshikha|last3=Kalita|first3=Mohan C.|last4=Deka|first4=Suresh|date=2016-07-14|title=Development of an Efficient Bacterial Consortium for the Potential Remediation of Hydrocarbons from Contaminated Sites |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=7|pages=1092|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.01092 |pmc=4943938|pmid=27471499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiment took combinations of five native naturally occurring hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, and analyzed the different cocktails to see which degraded poly-aromatic hydrocarbons the best.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The combination of ''Bacillus pumilis'' KS2 and ''Bacillus cereus'' R2 was found to be the most effective, degrading 84.15% of the [[Total petroleum hydrocarbon|TPH]] after 5 weeks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Further remediation efforts have turned to the issue of agricultural [[Pesticide]] run-off. Pesticides vary in class and function, and in high concentration often lead to highly toxic environmental risks.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doolotkeldieva|first=Tinatin|last2=Konurbaeva|first2=Maxabat|last3=Bobusheva|first3=Saykal|date=2018-11-01|title=Microbial communities in pesticide-contaminated soils in Kyrgyzstan and bioremediation possibilities |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research|language=en|volume=25|issue=32|pages=31848–31862|doi=10.1007/s11356-017-0048-5 |pmc=6208721|pmid=28884389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the over-500 types of pesticides in current use, two serious issues are their general lack of biodegradability and unpredictability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van der Werf |first1=Hayo M.G. |title=Assessing the impact of pesticides on the environment |journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment |date=December 1996 |volume=60 |issue=2–3 |pages=81–96 |doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(96)01096-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kyrgyzstan, researchers assessed soil around a pesticide dump and discovered not only that the soil had poor microflora diversity, but that some of the species that were present used metabolic pathways to digest the pesticides.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The two most-efficient species found were ''Pseudomonas fluorescens'' and ''Bacillus polymyxa'', with ''B. polymyxa'' degrading 48.2% of the pesticide [[Aldrin]] after 12 days.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, when the strains were combined with each other as well as some other less-efficient yet native bacteria, pesticide degradation increased to 54.0% in the same conditions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Doolatkeldieva et al. discussed their findings, saying &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is consequently possible that the degrading capacity of the bacteria could be increased only through co-cultivation, which shows that these bacteria naturally coexist and are dependent on each other for the utilization of environmental substances. In the oxidation and hydrolysis pathways of pesticide degradation, each bacterium can produce metabolites that will be utilized by the enzyme system of the next bacterium".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Bioplastic==
As an answer to the increase in use of non-biodegradable, oil-based plastics and its subsequent accumulation as waste, scientists have developed biodegradable and compostable alternatives often called [[Bioplastic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Song |first1=J. H. |last2=Murphy |first2=R. J. |last3=Narayan |first3=R. |last4=Davies |first4=G. B. H. |title=Biodegradable and compostable alternatives to conventional plastics |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=27 July 2009 |volume=364 |issue=1526 |pages=2127–2139 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0289 |pmc=2873018 |pmid=19528060 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all biologically created plastics are necessarily biodegradable, and this can be a source of confusion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biokunststoffe.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=41&amp;Itemid=121&amp;lang=en|title=What are Bioplastics?|last=Kunststoffe|date=August 2008|website=Bio-plastics.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it is important to distinguish between the types of bioplastics, biodegradable bioplastics which can be degraded by some microflora and simply bio-based plastics which are a renewable source of plastic but require more effort to dispose of.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

One of the bioplastics of interest is [[Polyhydroxybutyrate]], abbreviated to PHB. PHB is a biodegradable bioplastic that has applications for food packaging due to being non-toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hankermeyer |first1=CR |last2=Tjeerdema |first2=RS |title=Polyhydroxybutyrate: plastic made and degraded by microorganisms. |journal=Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology |date=1999 |volume=159 |pages=1–24 |pmid=9921137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Repurposed ''E. coli'', as well as ''Halomonas boliviensis'', have been shown to produce PHB.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weiss |first1=Taylor L. |last2=Young |first2=Eric J. |last3=Ducat |first3=Daniel C. |title=A synthetic, light-driven consortium of cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria enables stable polyhydroxybutyrate production |journal=Metabolic Engineering |date=November 2017 |volume=44 |pages=236–245 |doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2017.10.009 |pmid=29061492 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rahman |first1=Asif |last2=Linton |first2=Elisabeth |last3=Hatch |first3=Alex D |last4=Sims |first4=Ronald C |last5=Miller |first5=Charles D |title=Secretion of polyhydroxybutyrate in Escherichia coli using a synthetic biological engineering approach |journal=Journal of Biological Engineering |date=2013 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=24 |doi=10.1186/1754-1611-7-24 |pmc=4015293 |pmid=24139229 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PHB production starting from carbon dioxide in a co-culture between [[Synechococcus|''S. elongatus'']] and [[Halomonas|H. boliviensis]] has proven to be a stable continually-productive pair for 5 months without the aid of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

      <text bytes="2341" xml:space="preserve">The '''Analytical Information Markup Language''' ('''AnIML''') is an open [https://www.astm.org/COMMIT/SUBCOMMIT/E1315.htm ASTM] [[XML]] standard for storing and sharing any analytical chemistry and biological data.

== AnIML and FAIR data ==
A main reason of using AnIML is that [[FAIR data]] standards are automatically implemented. As AnIML's structure is human readable, [[Accessibility]] is given. [[Interoperability]], [[Reusability]] and [[Findability]] are secured by the AnIML Core and AnIML Technique Definitions.

== History ==
AnIML has been continuously worked on starting from 2003 up until 2019. The last AnIML Core Version update happened in 2010.

== Architecture ==
AnIML is a [[XML]] standard which consists of two logical layers:

* [https://github.com/AnIML/schemas/blob/master/animl-core.xsd AnIML Core]
* [https://github.com/AnIML/techniques AnIML Technique Definitions]

Additionally, AnIML Technique Definition Documents apply constraints to the AnIML Core and are specified by the AnIML Technique Definitions.

The AnIML Core consists of a set of rules defining the structure of the [[XML]] document, providing a universal container for arbitrary analytical data. AnIML Technique Definitions describe how to use the AnIML Core to record experiments of a particular scientific discipline. There is a big similarity between the mechanisms of AnIML and the [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] format. The AnIML Core defines the data container whereas the AnIML Technique Definitions act similar to the [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] codec. It defines how the data needs to be structured and labeled. Technique Definitions are [[XML]] documents, specified by the Technique Schema.

[[File:Babesia life cycle human en.svg|thumb|240px|Life cycle of the single-celled parasite ''[[Babesia]]''.]]
In [[biology]], a '''biological life cycle''' (or just '''life cycle''' or '''lifecycle''' when the biological context is clear) is a series of changes in form that an organism undergoes, returning to the starting state. "The concept is closely related to those of the life history, [[Developmental biology|development]] and [[ontogeny]], but differs from them in stressing renewal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Graham Bell  |author2=Vassiliki Koufopanou  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The architecture of the life cycle in small organisms |journal=Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences |year=1991 |volume=332 |issue=1262 |pages=81–89 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1991.0035|jstor = 55494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rodr2014/&gt; Transitions of form may involve growth, [[asexual reproduction]], or [[sexual reproduction]].

In some organisms, different "generations" of the species succeed each other during the life cycle. For [[Embryophyte|plants]] and many [[algae]], there are two multicellular stages, and the life cycle is referred to as [[alternation of generations]]. The term '''life history''' is often used, particularly for organisms such as the [[red algae]] which have three multicellular stages (or more), rather than two.&lt;ref name="Dixon73"&gt;Dixon, P.S. 1973. ''Biology of the Rhodophyta.'' Oliver &amp; Boyd. {{ISBN|0 05 002485 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life cycles that include sexual reproduction involve alternating [[haploid]] (''n'') and [[diploid]] (2''n'') stages, i.e., a change of [[ploidy]] is involved. To return from a diploid stage to a haploid stage, [[meiosis]] must occur. In regard to changes of [[ploidy]], there are 3 types of cycles:
*'''''haplontic''''' life cycle — the haploid stage is multicellular and the diploid stage is a single cell, meiosis is "zygotic".
*'''''diplontic''''' life cycle — the diploid stage is multicellular and haploid [[gamete]]s are formed, meiosis is "gametic".
*'''''haplodiplontic''''' life cycle (also referred to as ''diplohaplontic'', ''diplobiontic'', or ''dibiontic'' life cycle) — multicellular diploid and haploid stages occur, meiosis is "sporic".

The cycles differ in when [[mitosis]] (growth) occurs. '''Zygotic meiosis''' and '''gametic meiosis''' have one mitotic stage: mitosis occurs during the ''n'' phase in zygotic meiosis and during the 2''n'' phase in gametic meiosis. Therefore, zygotic and gametic meiosis are collectively termed '''haplobiontic''' (single mitotic phase, not to be confused with haplontic). '''Sporic meiosis''', on the other hand, has mitosis in two stages, both the diploid and haploid stages, termed '''diplobiontic''' (not to be confused with diplontic).

==Discovery==
The study of [[reproduction]] and [[Embryogenesis|development]] in organisms was carried out by many botanists and zoologists.

[[Wilhelm Hofmeister]] demonstrated that [[alternation of generations]] is a feature that unites plants, and published this result in 1851 (see [[History of botany#Plant sexuality|plant sexuality]]).

Some terms (haplobiont and diplobiont) used for the description of life cycles were proposed initially for algae by Nils Svedelius, and then became used for other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Nils Eberhard Svedelius. 1873-1960 | author=C.

''Encyclopedia of Microbiology''. Academic Press. Volume 4, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haplontic life cycle==
[[File:Haploid English.svg|thumb|250px|Zygotic meiosis]]
A '''zygotic meiosis''' is a [[meiosis]] of a [[zygote]] immediately after [[karyogamy]], which is the fusion of two [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]]. This way, the organism ends its diploid phase and produces several haploid cells. These cells divide [[mitotic]]ally to form either larger, multicellular individuals, or more haploid cells. Two opposite types of gametes (e.g., male and female) from these individuals or cells fuse to become a zygote.

In the whole cycle, zygotes are the only diploid cell; mitosis occurs only in the haploid phase.

The individuals or cells as a result of mitosis are '''haplonts''', hence this life cycle is also called '''haplontic life cycle'''. Haplonts are:

==Diplontic life cycle==
[[File:Diploid English.svg|thumb|250px|Gametic meiosis]]

In '''gametic meiosis''', instead of immediately dividing ''meiotically'' to produce haploid cells, the zygote divides ''mitotically'' to produce a multicellular diploid individual or a group of more unicellular diploid cells. Cells from the diploid individuals then undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells or [[gamete]]s. Haploid cells may divide again (by mitosis) to form more haploid cells, as in many yeasts, but the haploid phase is not the predominant life cycle phase. In most diplonts, mitosis occurs only in the diploid phase, i.e. gametes usually form quickly and fuse to produce diploid zygotes.

In the whole cycle, gametes are usually the only haploid cells, and mitosis usually occurs only in the diploid phase.

The diploid multicellular individual is a '''diplont''', hence a gametic meiosis is also called a '''diplontic life cycle'''. Diplonts are:

* In [[archaeplastida]]ns: some [[green algae]] (e.g., ''[[Cladophora|Cladophora glomerata]]'',&lt;ref&gt;O. P. Sharma. Textbook of Algae, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Acetabularia]]''&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;)

==Haplodiplontic life cycle==
[[File:Diplohaplontic English.svg|thumb|250px|Sporic meiosis]]
{{Main|Alternation of generations}}
In '''sporic meiosis''' (also commonly known as '''intermediary meiosis'''), the zygote divides mitotically to produce a multicellular diploid [[sporophyte]]. The sporophyte creates spores via meiosis which ''also'' then divide mitotically producing haploid individuals called [[gametophyte]]s. The gametophytes produce gametes via mitosis. In some plants the gametophyte is not only small-sized but also short-lived; in other plants and many algae, the gametophyte is the "dominant" stage of the life cycle.

Haplodiplonts are:

* In [[archaeplastida]]ns: [[red algae]] (which have two sporophyte generations), some [[green algae]] (e.g., ''[[Ulva (genus)|Ulva]]''), [[Embryophyte|land plants]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[stramenopiles]]: most [[brown algae]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[rhizaria]]ns: many [[foraminiferan]]s,&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt; [[plasmodiophoromycetes]]&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* In [[amoebozoa]]: [[myxogastrid]]s
* In [[opisthokont]]s: some [[fungi]] (some [[chytrid]]s, some [[ascomycetes]] like the [[brewer's yeast]])&lt;ref name="Díaz" /&gt;
* Other eukaryotes: [[haptophyte]]s&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt;

Some animals have a [[sex-determination system]] called [[haplodiploid]], but this is not related to the haplodiplontic life cycle.

== Vegetative meiosis ==
Some [[red algae]] (such as ''Bonnemaisonia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Somatic meiosis in the life history of Bonnemaisonia asparagoides and Bonnemaisonia clavata (Bonnemaisoniales, Rhodophyta) from the Iberian peninsula|first1=Noemi|last1=Salvador Soler|first2=Amelia|last2=Gomez Garreta|first3=M.|last3=Antonia Ribera Siguan|date=1 August 2009|journal=European Journal of Phycology|volume=44|issue=3|pages=381–393|doi=10.1080/09670260902780782}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Lemanea]]'') and green algae (such as ''[[Prasiola]]'') have '''vegetative meiosis''', also called '''somatic meiosis''', which is a rare phenomenon.&lt;ref name=vdh1995/&gt;{{rp|82}} Vegetative meiosis can occur in haplodiplontic and also in diplontic life cycles. The gametophytes remain attached to and part of the sporophyte. Vegetative (non-reproductive) diploid cells undergo meiosis, generating vegetative haploid cells. These undergo many mitosis, and produces gametes.

A different phenomenon, called '''vegetative diploidization''', a type of [[apomixis]], occurs in some [[brown alga]]e (e.g., ''Elachista stellaris'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lewis, R.J.|year=1996|title=Chromosomes of the brown algae|journal=Phycologia|volume=35|issue=1|pages=19–40|doi=10.2216/i0031-8884-35-1-19.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cells in a haploid part of the plant spontaneously duplicate their chromosomes to produce diploid tissue.

==Parasitic life cycle==

Parasites depend on the exploitation of one or more [[host (biology)|hosts]]. Those that must infect more than one host [[species]] to complete their life cycles are said to have complex or indirect life cycles, while those that infect a single species have direct life cycles.

If a parasite has to infect a given host in order to complete its life cycle, then it is said to be an [[obligate parasite]] of that host; sometimes, infection is [[facultative]]—the parasite can survive and complete its life cycle without infecting that particular host species. Parasites sometimes infect hosts in which they cannot complete their life cycles; these are accidental hosts.

A host in which parasites reproduce sexually is known as the definitive, final or primary host. In intermediate hosts, parasites either do not reproduce or do so asexually, but the parasite always develops to a new stage in this type of host. In some cases a parasite will infect a host, but not undergo any development, these hosts are known as [[paratenic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt and Roberts. 1985. Foundations of Parasitology 3rd Ed.  Times Mirror/Mosby College Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; or transport hosts. The paratenic host can be useful in raising the chance that the parasite will be transmitted to the definitive host. For example, the cat lungworm (''Aelurostrongylus abstrusus'') uses a slug or snail as an intermediate host; the first stage larva enters the mollusk and develops to the third stage larva, which is infectious to the definitive host—the cat. If a mouse eats the slug, the third stage larva will enter the mouse's tissues, but will not undergo any development.

==Evolution==
The primitive type of life cycle probably had haploid individuals with asexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="Ruppert" /&gt; [[Bacteria]] and [[archaea]] exhibit a life cycle like this, and some eukaryotes apparently do too (e.g., [[Cryptophyta]], [[Choanoflagellata]], many  [[Euglenozoa]], many [[Amoebozoa]], some red algae, some [[green algae]], the [[imperfect fungi]], some [[rotifer]]s and many other groups, not necessarily haploid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Heywood, P. |author2=Magee, P.T. |year=1976|title=Meiosis in protists.

== Mechanism ==
For the majority of eukaryotic [[messenger RNA|messenger RNAs (mRNAs)]], translation initiates from a methionine-encoding AUG [[start codon]] following the molecular processes of 'cap-binding' and 'scanning' by ribosomal pre-initiation complexes (PICs). In rare exceptions, such as translation by viral [[Internal ribosome entry site|IRES]]-containing mRNAs, 'cap-binding' and/or 'scanning' are not required for initiation, although AUG is still typically used as the first codon. RAN translation is an exception to the canonical rules as it uses variable start site selection and initiates from a non-AUG codon, but may still depend on 'cap-binding' and 'scanning'.&lt;ref name="CoxCooper2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Diana C.|last2=Cooper|first2=Thomas A.|title=Non-canonical RAN Translation of CGG Repeats Has Canonical Requirements|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=62|issue=2|year=2016|pages=155–156|issn=10972765|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2016.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease ==
RAN translation produces a variety of dipeptide repeat proteins by translation of expanded trinucleotide repeats present in an intron of the [[C9orf72]] gene. The expansion of the trinucleotide repeats and thus accumulation of dipeptide repeat proteins are thought to cause cellular toxicity that leads to neurodegeneration in [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] disease.&lt;ref name="RenouxTodd2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Renoux|first1=Abigail J.|last2=Todd|first2=Peter K.|title=Neurodegeneration the RNA way|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|volume=97|issue=2|year=2012|pages=173–189|issn=03010082|doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2011.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strzyz2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strzyz|first1=Paulina|title=Translation: The features of pathologic RAN translation|journal=Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology|volume=17|issue=5|year=2016|pages=264–264|issn=1471-0072|doi=10.1038/nrm.2016.52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bañez-CoronelAyhan2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bañez-Coronel|first1=Monica|last2=Ayhan|first2=Fatma|last3=Tarabochia|first3=Alex D.|last4=Zu|first4=Tao|last5=Perez|first5=Barbara A.|last6=Tusi|first6=Solaleh Khoramian|last7=Pletnikova|first7=Olga|last8=Borchelt|first8=David R.|last9=Ross|first9=Christopher A.|last10=Margolis|first10=Russell L.|last11=Yachnis|first11=Anthony T.|last12=Troncoso|first12=Juan C.|last13=Ranum|first13=Laura P.W.|title=RAN Translation in Huntington Disease|journal=Neuron|volume=88|issue=4|year=2015|pages=667–677|issn=08966273|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2015.10.038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KearseGreen2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kearse|first1=Michael G.|last2=Green|first2=Katelyn M.|last3=Krans|first3=Amy|last4=Rodriguez|first4=Caitlin M.|last5=Linsalata|first5=Alexander E.|last6=Goldstrohm|first6=Aaron C.|last7=Todd|first7=Peter K.|title=CGG Repeat-Associated Non-AUG Translation Utilizes a Cap-Dependent Scanning Mechanism of Initiation to Produce Toxic Proteins|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=62|issue=2|year=2016|pages=314–322|issn=10972765|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2016.02.034}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GreenLinsalata2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Katelyn M.|last2=Linsalata|first2=Alexander E.|last3=Todd|first3=Peter K.|title=RAN translation—What makes it run?|journal=Brain Research|volume=1647|year=2016|pages=30–42|issn=00068993|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2016.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MoriWeng2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mori|first1=K.|last2=Weng|first2=S.-M.|last3=Arzberger|first3=T.|last4=May|first4=S.|last5=Rentzsch|first5=K.|last6=Kremmer|first6=E.|last7=Schmid|first7=B.|last8=Kretzschmar|first8=H.

{{short description|forming chemicals that look biological but are not}}
'''Chemical gardening''' refers to the process of creating complex biological-looking structures by mixing chemicals together wherever large amounts of such chemicals naturally occur. More simply, forming natural minerals to mimic biology. For example, mixing iron-rich particles with alkaline liquids containing the chemicals silicate or carbonate have created biological-looking structures. Such structures are actually non-biological even though they may appear to be biological and/or [[fossil]]s.&lt;ref name="EA-20191127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TRS-20191127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PT-20160301"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steinbock, Oliver |display-authors=et al. |title=The fertile physics of chemical gardens |url=https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/PT.3.3108 |date=1 March 2019 |journal=[[physics Today]] |volume=69 |issue=3 |page=44 |doi=10.1063/PT.3.3108 |accessdate=27 November 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to researchers, "Chemical reactions like these have been studied for hundreds of years but they had not previously been shown to mimic these tiny iron-rich structures inside rocks. These results call for a re-examination of many ancient real-world examples to see if they are more likely to be fossils or non-biological mineral deposits."&lt;ref name="EA-20191127" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TRS-20191127" /&gt;

'''Biological organization''' is the [[hierarchy]] of [[complex systems|complex]] [[biology|biological]] [[structures]] and [[systems]] that define [[life]] using a [[Reductionism|reductionistic]] approach.&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"&gt;{{harvnb|Solomon|Berg|Martin|2002|pp=9&amp;ndash;10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional hierarchy, as detailed below, extends from [[atom]]s to [[biosphere]]s. The higher levels of this scheme are often referred to as an '''ecological organization''' concept, or as the [[Branches of science|field]],  [[#Fundamentals|hierarchical ecology]].

Each level in the hierarchy represents an increase in organizational [[wikt:complexity|complexity]], with each "object" being primarily composed of the previous level's basic unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic principle behind the organization is the concept of ''[[emergence]]''—the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and irrelevant at the lower levels.

The biological organization of life is a fundamental premise for numerous areas of [[scientific research]], particularly in the [[Medicine|medical sciences]]. Without this necessary degree of organization, it would be much more difficult—and likely impossible—to apply the study of the effects of various [[physical phenomenon|physical]] and [[chemical phenomenon|chemical]] phenomena to [[diseases]] and [[physiology]] (body function). For example, fields such as [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]] and [[behavioral neuroscience]] could not exist if the brain was not composed of specific types of cells, and the basic concepts of [[pharmacology]] could not exist if it was not known that a change at the cellular level can affect an entire organism. These applications extend into the [[ecological]] levels as well. For example, [[DDT]]'s direct [[insecticide|insecticidal]] effect occurs at the [[subcellular]] level, but affects higher levels up to and including multiple [[ecosystem]]s. Theoretically, a change in one [[atom]] could change the entire [[biosphere]].

==Levels==
{{See also|Integrative level}}
[[File:Levels of Organization.svg|thumb|The simplest unit of life is the atom, like oxygen. Two or more atoms is a molecule, like a dioxide. Many small molecules may combine in a chemical reaction to make up a macromolecule, such as a phospholipid. Multiple macromolecules form a cell, like a club cell. A group of cells functioning together as a tissue, for example, Epithelial tissue. Different tissues make up an organ, like a lung. Organs work together to form an organ system, such as the Respiratory System. All of the organ systems make a living organism, like a lion. A group of the same organism living together in an area is a population, such as a pride of lions. Two or more populations interacting with each other form a community, for example, lion and zebra populations interacting with each other.  Communities interacting not only with each other but also with the physical environment encompass an ecosystem, such as the Savanna ecosystem. All of the ecosystems make up the biosphere, the area of life on Earth.]]
The simple standard biological organization scheme, from the lowest level to the highest level, is as follows:&lt;ref name="Solomon intro"/&gt;

More complex schemes incorporate many more levels. For example, a molecule can be viewed as a grouping of [[chemical element|elements]], and an atom can be further divided into [[subatomic particle]]s (these levels are outside the scope of biological organization). Each level can also be broken down into its own hierarchy, and specific types of these biological objects can have their own hierarchical scheme. For example, [[genome]]s can be further subdivided into a hierarchy of [[gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pavé|2006|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level in the hierarchy can be described by its lower levels. For example, the organism may be described at any of its component levels, including the atomic, molecular, cellular, histological (tissue), organ and organ system levels. Furthermore, at every level of the hierarchy, new functions necessary for the control of life appear. These new roles are not functions that the lower level components are capable of and are thus referred to as ''[[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent properties]]''.

Every organism is organised, though not necessarily to the same degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Postlethwait|Hopson|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism can not be organised at the [[histological]] (tissue) level if it is not composed of tissues in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witzany | first1 = G | year = 2014 | title = Biological Self-organization | url = | journal = International Journal of Signs and Semiotic Systems | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamentals ==
Empirically, a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems we observe in nature exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|Jørgensen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical foundations are summarized by thermodynamics.
When [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organization|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.

A simpler and more direct way to explain the fundamentals of the "hierarchical organization of life", was introduced in [[Ecology]] by [[Howard T. Odum|Odum]] and others as the "[[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s hierarchical principle";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|1969|pp=192–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon&lt;ref&gt;Simon's texts at {{doi|10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_4}}, [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705161014/http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/simon.html |date=July 5, 2015 }} or [http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ johncarlosbaez/2011/08/29 transcriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531145800/https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/08/29/hierarchical-organization-and-biological-evolution-part-1/ |date=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that hierarchy "''emerges almost inevitably through a wide variety of evolutionary processes, for the simple reason that &lt;u&gt;hierarchical structures are stable&lt;/u&gt;''".

To motivate this deep idea, he offered his "parable" about imaginary watchmakers.

:{|
!Parable of the Watchmakers
|-
|
There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang frequently; new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this?

The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch (for instance, to answer the phone), it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.

Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten components each. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub-assembly. Finally, ten of the larger subassemblies constituted the whole watch. Each subassembly could be put down without falling apart.

== Brain iron accumulation ==
The most relevant risk associated with a H63D mutation is for brain damage due to iron accumulation which causes oxidation processes within the affected cells ([[chronic condition|chronic]] [[oxidative stress]]) and, as a consequence, leading to cell death (scarring of brain tissue) with severely disturbed neurotransmitter activity. These incurable processes include increased cellular iron, oxidative stress ([[free radical]] activity), brain [[glutamate]] dysbalance, and abnormal levels of [[tau protein]]s and [[alpha-synuclein]] which both may result in [[dementia]]s and [[parkinson’s disease]], or similar conditions. Scientists found that patients homozygous for H63D show a higher risk of earlier signs of cognitive impairment and earlier onset of dementias compared to individuals with normal HFE genes or H63D heterozygous mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|displayauthors=3|vauthors=Bartzokis G, Lu PH, Tishler TA, Peters DG, Kosenko A, Barrall KA, Finn JP, Villablanca P, Laub G, Altshuler LL, Geschwind DH, Mintz J, Neely E, Connor JR|date=2010|title=Prevalent Iron Metabolism Gene Variants Associated with Increased Brain Ferritin Iron in Healthy Older Men|journal=[[Journal of Alzheimer's Disease|J.

[[File:11 Hegasy Phage T4 Wiki E CCBYSA.png|thumb|Anatomy and infection cycle of phage T4]]

A '''bacteriophage''' ({{IPAc-en|b|æ|k|ˈ|t|ɪər|i|əʊ|f|eɪ|dʒ}}), also known informally as a '''''phage''''' ({{IPAc-en|f|eɪ|dʒ}}), is a [[virus]] that infects and replicates within [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. The term was derived from "bacteria" and the [[Greek language|Greek]] φαγεῖν (''{{lang|grc-Latn|phagein}}''), meaning "to devour". Bacteriophages are composed of [[protein]]s that [[Capsid|encapsulate]] a [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] [[genome]], and may have structures that are either simple or elaborate. Their genomes may encode as few as four genes (e.g. [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]]) and as many as hundreds of [[genes]]. Phages replicate within the bacterium following the injection of their genome into its [[cytoplasm]].

Bacteriophages are among the most common and diverse entities in the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book | author = McGrath S and van Sinderen D (editors). | title = Bacteriophage: Genetics and Molecular Biology | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2007 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/phage | isbn = 978-1-904455-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteriophages are ubiquitous viruses, found wherever bacteria exist. It is estimated there are more than 10&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; bacteriophages on the planet, more than every other organism on Earth, including bacteria, combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2017-04-25-novel-phage-therapy-saves-patient-with-multidrug-resistant-bacterial-infection.aspx|title=Novel Phage Therapy Saves Patient with Multidrug-Resistant Bacterial Infection|work=UC Health – UC San Diego|access-date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the densest natural sources for phages and other viruses is seawater, where up to 9x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; [[virus|virions]] per millilitre have been found in [[microbial mats]] at the surface,&lt;ref name="mmbr"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wommack | first1 = K.

== Classification ==
Bacteriophages occur abundantly in the biosphere, with different genomes, and lifestyles. Phages are classified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) according to [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and nucleic acid.

Nineteen families are currently recognized by the ICTV that infect [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. Of these, only two families have RNA genomes, and only five families are surrounded by an envelope. Of the viral families with DNA genomes, only two have single-stranded genomes. Eight of the viral families with DNA genomes have circular genomes, while nine have linear genomes. Nine families infect bacteria only, nine infect archaea only, and one (''Tectiviridae'') infects both bacteria and archaea.

It has been suggested that members of ''[[Picobirnaviridae]]'' infect bacteria, but not mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors = Krishnamurthy SR, Wang D. | title = Extensive conservation of prokaryotic ribosomal binding sites in known and novel picobirnaviruses | journal = Virology | year = 2018 | volume = 516 | pages = 108–114 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2018.01.006 | pmid = 29346073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1896, [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin]] reported that something in the waters of the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in [[India]] had a marked [[antibacterial]] action against [[cholera]] and it could pass through a very fine porcelain filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hankin E H. |title=L'action bactericide des eaux de la Jumna et du Gange sur le vibrion du cholera|journal=Annales de l'Institut Pasteur|year=1896|volume=10|pages=511–523|language=French|url=https://archive.org/stream/annalesdelinstit10inst#page/511/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, [[United Kingdom|British]] [[bacteriologist]] [[Frederick Twort]], superintendent of the Brown Institution of London, discovered a small agent that infected and killed bacteria. He believed the agent must be one of the following:
# a stage in the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of the bacteria 
# an [[enzyme]] produced by the bacteria themselves, or
# a virus that grew on and destroyed the bacteria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Twort | first1 = F.

Twort's research was interrupted by the onset of [[World War I]] and a shortage of funding.

[[File:Félix d'Hérelle.jpg|right|thumb|[[Félix d'Herelle]]]]
Independently, [[French-Canadian]] [[microbiology|microbiologist]] [[Félix d'Hérelle]], working at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]], announced on 3 September 1917, that he had discovered "an invisible, antagonistic microbe of the [[dysentery]] bacillus". For d’Hérelle, there was no question as to the nature of his discovery: "In a flash I had understood: what caused my clear spots was in fact an invisible microbe … a virus parasitic on bacteria."&lt;ref name="Herelle1917"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; D'Hérelle called the virus a bacteriophage, a bacteria-eater (from the Greek ''{{lang|grc-Latn|phagein}}'' meaning "to devour"). He also recorded a dramatic account of a man suffering from dysentery who was restored to good health by the bacteriophages.&lt;ref name="Herelle1949"&gt;{{cite journal

More than a half a century later, in 1969, [[Max Delbrück]], [[Alfred Hershey]], and [[Salvador Luria]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their discoveries of the replication of viruses and their genetic structure.&lt;ref name="nobel-1969"&gt;{{cite web

==Uses==
=== Phage therapy ===
{{Main|Phage therapy}}

Phages were discovered to be antibacterial agents and were used in the former [[Soviet]] Republic of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (pioneered there by [[Giorgi Eliava]] with help from the co-discoverer of bacteriophages, [[Félix d'Herelle]]) during the 1920s and 1930s for treating bacterial infections. They had widespread use, including treatment of soldiers in the [[Red Army]]. However, they were abandoned for general use in the West for several reasons:

* Antibiotics were discovered and marketed widely. They were easier to make, store, and to prescribe.
* Medical trials of phages were carried out, but a basic lack of understanding raised questions about the validity of these trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kutter|first1=Elizabeth|last2=De Vos|first2=Daniel|last3=Gvasalia|first3=Guram|last4=Alavidze|first4=Zemphira|last5=Gogokhia|first5=Lasha|last6=Kuhl|first6=Sarah|last7=Abedon|first7=Stephen|title=Phage Therapy in Clinical Practice: Treatment of Human Infections|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology|date=1 January 2010|volume=11|issue=1|pages=69–86|doi=10.2174/138920110790725401|pmid=20214609|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c4536f7c0fed5b32b600b8f61ceb69209b4bf819}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Publication of research in the Soviet Union was mainly in the [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[Georgian language]]s and for many years, was not followed internationally.

The use of phages has continued since the end of the Cold War in Russia,&lt;ref name="Gol"&gt;''Сергей Головин'' [https://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/31498/ Бактериофаги: убийцы в роли спасителей] // [[Наука и жизнь]]. – 2017. – № 6. – С. 26–33&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia and elsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe.

== Replication ==
[[File:Phage injection.png|thumb|right|upright=2|Diagram of the DNA injection process]]
Bacteriophages may have a [[lytic cycle]] or a [[lysogenic cycle]]. With ''lytic phages'' such as the [[T4 phage]], bacterial cells are broken open (lysed) and destroyed after immediate replication of the virion. As soon as the cell is destroyed, the phage progeny can find new hosts to infect. Lytic phages are more suitable for [[phage therapy]]. Some lytic phages undergo a phenomenon known as lysis inhibition, where completed phage progeny will not immediately lyse out of the cell if extracellular phage concentrations are high. This mechanism is not identical to that of [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate phage]] going dormant and usually, is temporary.

In contrast, the ''[[lysogenic cycle]]'' does not result in immediate lysing of the host cell. Those phages able to undergo lysogeny are known as [[temperate phage]]s. Their viral genome will integrate with host DNA and replicate along with it, relatively harmlessly, or may even become established as a [[plasmid]]. The virus remains dormant until host conditions deteriorate, perhaps due to depletion of nutrients, then, the [[endogenous]] phages (known as [[prophage]]s) become active. At this point they initiate the reproductive cycle, resulting in lysis of the host cell. As the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is replicated in all offspring of the cell. An example of a bacteriophage known to follow the lysogenic cycle and the lytic cycle is the [[phage lambda]] of ''E. coli.''&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Kenneth A., Jonathan B. Losos, Susan R. Singer, Peter H Raven, and George B. Johnson. (2011). ''Biology'', p. 533. McGraw-Hill, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-07-893649-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes prophages may provide benefits to the host bacterium while they are dormant by adding new functions to the bacterial [[genome]], in a phenomenon called [[lysogenic conversion]]. Examples are the conversion of harmless strains of ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'' or ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' by bacteriophages, to highly virulent ones that cause [[diphtheria]] or [[cholera]], respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid19007916"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mokrousov I |title=''Corynebacterium diphtheriae'': genome diversity, population structure and genotyping perspectives |journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |date= 2009 |pmid=19007916 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.09.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21799407"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Charles RC, Ryan ET |title=Cholera in the 21st century |journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=472–7 |date=October 2011 |pmid=21799407 |doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e32834a88af }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these toxin-encoding prophages have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Keen | first1 = E.

=== Attachment and penetration ===

This specificity means a bacteriophage can infect only certain bacteria bearing receptors to which they can bind, which in turn, determines the phage's host range. Polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, like endolysins are virion-associated proteins to enzymatically degrade the capsular outer layer of their hosts, at the initial step of a tightly programmed phage infection process.
Host growth conditions also influence the ability of the phage to attach and invade them.&lt;ref name="pmid9356254"&gt;{{Cite journal

Myovirus bacteriophages use a [[hypodermic syringe]]-like motion to inject their genetic material into the cell. After contacting the appropriate receptor, the tail fibers flex to bring the base plate closer to the surface of the cell. This is known as reversible binding. Once attached completely, irreversible binding is initiated and the tail contracts, possibly with the help of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], present in the tail,&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt; injecting genetic material through the bacterial membrane. The injection is accomplished through a sort of bending motion in the shaft by going to the side, contracting closer to the cell and pushing back up. Podoviruses lack an elongated tail sheath like that of a myovirus, so instead, they use their small, tooth-like tail fibers enzymatically to degrade a portion of the cell membrane before inserting their genetic material.

=== Synthesis of proteins and nucleic acid ===
Within minutes, bacterial [[ribosome]]s start translating viral mRNA into protein. For RNA-based phages, [[RNA replicase]] is synthesized early in the process. Proteins modify the bacterial [[RNA polymerase]] so it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The host's normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted, and it is forced to manufacture viral products instead. These products go on to become part of new virions within the cell, helper proteins that contribute to the assemblage of new virions, or proteins involved in cell [[lysis]]. In 1972, [[Walter Fiers]] ([[University of Ghent]], [[Belgium]]) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene and in 1976, of the viral genome of [[bacteriophage MS2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Virion assembly ===
In the case of the [[T4 phage]], the construction of new virus particles involves the assistance of helper proteins. The base plates are assembled first, with the tails being built upon them afterward. The head capsids, constructed separately, will spontaneously assemble with the tails. The DNA is packed efficiently within the heads. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.
[[File:Tevenphage.svg|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of a typical tailed bacteriophage structure]]

=== Release of virions ===
Phages may be released via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, in a few cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called [[endolysin]], which attacks and breaks down the cell wall [[peptidoglycan]]. An altogether different phage type, the [[filamentous phage]], make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a [[lysogenic]] cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as [[prophage]].

== Genome structure ==
Given the millions of different phages in the environment, phage genomes come in a variety of forms and sizes. RNA phage such as [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]] have the smallest genomes, of only a few kilobases. However, some DNA phage such as [[Enterobacteria phage T4|T4]] may have large genomes with hundreds of genes; the size and shape of the [[capsid]] varies along with the size of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Black|first1=LW|last2=Thomas|first2=JA|title=Condensed genome structure|date=2012|volume=726|pages=469–87|pmid=22297527|pmc=3559133|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-0980-9_21|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|isbn=978-1-4614-0979-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacteriophage genomes can be highly [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]], i.e. the genome of many phage species appear to be composed of numerous individual modules. These modules may be found in other phage species in different arrangements. [[Mycobacteriophage]]s, bacteriophages with [[mycobacteria]]l hosts, have provided excellent examples of this mosaicism. In these mycobacteriophages, genetic assortment may be the result of repeated instances of [[site-specific recombination]] and [[illegitimate recombination]] (the result of phage genome acquisition of bacterial host genetic sequences).&lt;ref name="pmid18178732"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morris P, Marinelli LJ, Jacobs-Sera D, Hendrix RW, Hatfull GF |title=Genomic characterization of mycobacteriophage Giles: evidence for phage acquisition of host DNA by illegitimate recombination |journal=Journal of Bacteriology |volume=190 |issue=6 |pages=2172–82 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18178732 |pmc=2258872 |doi=10.1128/JB.01657-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary mechanisms shaping the genomes of bacterial viruses vary between different families and depend upon the type of the nucleic acid, characteristics of the virion structure, as well as the mode of the viral life cycle.&lt;ref name="pmid22126996"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krupovic M, Prangishvili D, Hendrix RW, Bamford DH |title=Genomics of bacterial and archaeal viruses: dynamics within the prokaryotic virosphere |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=610–35 |date=December 2011 |pmid=22126996 |pmc=3232739 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00011-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology ==
Phages often have dramatic effects on their hosts. As a consequence, the transcription pattern of the infected bacterium may change considerably. For instance, infection of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' by the temperate phage PaP3 changed the expression of 38% (2160/5633) of its host's genes. Many of these effects are probably indirect, hence the challenge becomes to identify the direct interactions among bacteria and phage.&lt;ref name="pmid26750429"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhao X, Chen C, Shen W, Huang G, Le S, Lu S, Li M, Zhao Y, Wang J, Rao X, Li G, Shen M, Guo K, Yang Y, Tan Y, Hu F |title=Global Transcriptomic Analysis of Interactions between ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' and Bacteriophage PaP3 |journal=Sci Rep |volume=6 |pages=19237 |year=2016 |pmid=26750429 |doi=10.1038/srep19237 |pmc=4707531|bibcode=2016NatSR...619237Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several attempts have been made to map [[protein–protein interaction]]s among phage and their host. For instance, bacteriophage lambda was found to interact with its host, [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], by 31 interactions. However, a large-scale study revealed 62 interactions, most of which were new. Again, the significance of many of these interactions remains unclear, but these studies suggest that there most likely are several key interactions and many indirect interactions whose role remains uncharacterized.&lt;ref name="pmid24049175"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blasche S, Wuchty S, Rajagopala SV, Uetz P |title=The protein interaction network of bacteriophage lambda with its host, Escherichia coli |journal=J.

[[Metagenomics]] has allowed the in-water detection of bacteriophages that was not possible previously.&lt;ref name="pmid12384570"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Breitbart M, Salamon P, Andresen B, Mahaffy JM, Segall AM, Mead D, Azam F, Rohwer F |authorlink1=Mya Breitbart | title = Genomic analysis of uncultured marine viral communities | journal = Proc.

Also, bacteriophages have been used in [[hydrology|hydrological]] tracing and modelling in [[river]] systems, especially where surface water and [[groundwater]] interactions occur. The use of phages is preferred to the more conventional [[dye]] marker because they are significantly less absorbed when passing through ground waters and they are readily detected at very low concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

A '''kleptoprotein''' is a protein which is not encoded in the [[genome]] of the organism which uses it, but instead is obtained through diet from a prey organism. Importantly, a kleptoprotein must maintain its function and be mostly or entirely undigested, drawing a distinction from proteins that are digested for nutrition, which become destroyed and non-functional in the process.

This phenomena was first reported in the bioluminescent fish ''[[Parapriacanthus]]'', which has specialized light organs adapted towards [[counter-illumination]], but obtains the [[luciferase]] enzyme within these organs from bioluminescent ostracods, including ''[[Cypridina noctiluca]]'' or ''[[Vargula hilgendorfii]]''.&lt;ref name="Bessho-Uehara Yamamoto Shigenobu Mori 2020 p=eaax4942"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bessho-Uehara | first=Manabu | last2=Yamamoto | first2=Naoyuki | last3=Shigenobu | first3=Shuji | last4=Mori | first4=Hitoshi | last5=Kuwata | first5=Keiko | last6=Oba | first6=Yuichi | title=Kleptoprotein bioluminescence: Parapriacanthus fish obtain luciferase from ostracod prey | journal=Science Advances | publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) | volume=6 | issue=2 | year=2020 | issn=2375-2548 | doi=10.1126/sciadv.aax4942 | page=eaax4942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Performing arts}}
'''Music''' is an art form and [[culture|cultural]] activity whose medium is sound organized in time. General [[definitions of music]] include common elements such as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs [[melody]] and [[harmony]]), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], and [[articulation (music)|articulation]]), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]] (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different [[Music genre|styles or types]] of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and vocal techniques ranging from singing to [[rapping]]; there are solely [[Instrumental music|instrumental pieces]], [[a capella|solely vocal pieces]] (such as songs without instrumental [[accompaniment]]) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muse]]s").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368891 |title=Mousike, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus |publisher=perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See [[glossary of musical terminology]].

In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or [[Culture|cultural]] activity include the creation of works of music ([[song]]s, tunes, [[symphony|symphonies]], and so on), the [[Music criticism|criticism of music]], the [[Musicology|study of the history of music]], and the [[Aesthetics of music|aesthetic examination of music]]. [[Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Indian philosophers|Indian philosophers]] defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the [[harmony of the spheres]]" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer [[John Cage]] thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no [[noise]], only sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1E3BF930A2575BC0A964958260 |title=John Cage, 79, a Minimalist Enchanted With Sound, Dies |last=Kozinn |first=Allen |authorlink=Allan Kozinn |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 August 1992 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Grosse Fuge]]'' [[string quartet]] in 1825,&lt;ref&gt;Watson 2009, 109–10.{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; early [[jazz]] in the beginning of the 1900s&lt;ref&gt;Reiland Rabaka. ''Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the [[Hip Hop Movement]]''. Lexington Books, 2012. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hardcore punk]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Manabe, Noriko. ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima''. Oxford University Press, 2015. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of music, including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], [[art music]], [[Liturgical music|music written for religious ceremonies]] and [[work song]]s such as [[chantey]]s. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played [[Musical improvisation|improvisational music]] such as [[jazz]], and [[avant-garde]] styles of [[aleatory|chance-based]] [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries.

Music can be divided into [[music genre|genres]] (e.g., [[country music]]) and genres can be further divided into [[subgenre]]s (e.g., [[country blues]] and [[pop country]] are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Within [[the arts]], music may be classified as a [[performing arts|performing art]], a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a [[rock concert]] or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a [[theatre music|dramatic work]] (a [[music theater]] show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, [[CD player]], [[smartphone]] or as [[film score]] or TV show.

In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in  [[religious ritual]]s, [[rite of passage]] ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., [[dance club|dancing]]) and cultural activities ranging from amateur [[karaoke]] singing to playing in an amateur [[Funk|funk band]] or singing in a community [[choir]]. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a [[youth orchestra]], or work as a professional musician or singer. The [[music industry]] includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, [[jazz]] band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and [[sound engineer]]s), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings, [[sheet music]], and scores to customers.

==Etymology==
[[File:Muses sarcophagus Louvre MR880.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including [[the arts]].]]
The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muses]]").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and [[the arts]] and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the ''Online Etymological Dictionary'', the term "music" is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from [[Old French]] ''musique'' (12c.) and directly from [[Latin]] ''musica'' "the art of music," also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish ''música'', Italian ''musica'', [[Old High German]] ''mosica'', German ''Musik'', Dutch ''muziek'', Danish ''musik'')." This is derived from the "...Greek ''mousike (techne)'' "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses," from Mousa "Muse" (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In [[classical Greece]], [the term "music" refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and [[lyric poetry]]."&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=music |title=music |publisher=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a form of art or entertainment==
[[File:Photo récital 028.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|{{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Gabriel Ferlan|fr}} performing at a 2008 concert at the collège-lycée Saint-François Xavier]]
Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through [[sheet music]] scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the [[sheet music]] of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home [[tape recorder]]s in the 1980s and [[digital music]] in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or [[playlist]]s of their favourite songs and take them with them on a [[Cassette player|portable cassette player]] or MP3 player. Some music lovers create [[mix tape]]s of their favorite songs, which serve as a "self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved."&lt;ref&gt;Kirszner, Laurie G. (January 2012). ''Patterns for College Writing''. Bedford/St. Martin's. p. 520. {{ISBN|978-0-312-67684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere. [[Professional musician]]s are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or [[filmmaking|film production]] companies, and [[music school]]s. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or [[session musician]]s, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take [[music lesson|lessons]] with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community [[concert band]]s and community orchestras.

A distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in [[popular music]] forms such as rock, where [[Bootleg recording|illegally taped live concerts]] are prized by music lovers. In the [[jam band]] scene, live, improvised [[jam session]]s are preferred to studio recordings.

===Composition===
{{Main|Musical composition}}
[[File:Coffee and synths. KayoDot album "Hubardo" recording, 2013-06-13.jpg|thumb|People composing music in 2013 using [[electronic keyboard]]s and computers.]]
[[File:Michel Richard Delalande engraving BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|French [[Baroque music]] composer [[Michel Richard Delalande]] (1657–1726), pen in hand.]]
"Composition" is the act or practice of creating a song, an [[instrumental music]] piece, a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of [[music notation]], such as a [[sheet music|sheet music "score"]], which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the [[lead sheet]], which sets out the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[chord progression]]. In classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.

Even when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or [[musical phrasing|phrasing]] of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although a musical composition often uses [[musical notation]] and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the [[blues]], a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutosławski]]. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze.

The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].

===Notation===
{{Main|Musical notation}}
[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sheet music is written representation of music. This is a [[homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of a traditional piece entitled "[[Adeste Fideles]]", in standard two-staff format for mixed voices. {{audio|Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.mid|Play}}]]
In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a [[melody]], are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a "slow blues" or a "fast swing", which indicates the tempo and the genre.  To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of [[music theory]], [[harmony]] and the [[performance practice]] associated with a particular song or piece's genre.

Written notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as [[sheet music]] or, for individuals with computer [[scorewriter]] programs, as an image on a [[computer screen]]. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres requiring [[musical improvisation]], the performer often plays from music where only the [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g., [[jazz]] or [[country music]]).

In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the [[lead sheet]], which notates the melody, chords, [[lyrics]] (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. [[Fake book]]s are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit [[rhythm section]] members to improvise an [[accompaniment]] part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz "[[big band]]s." In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in [[tablature]] (often abbreviated as "tab"), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the [[lute]], a stringed, fretted instrument.

===Improvisation===
{{Main|Musical improvisation}}
[[Musical improvisation]] is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or chord progression. Improvisation is the act of instantaneous composition by performers, where compositional techniques are employed with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]], in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines and accompaniment parts. In the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments and [[basso continuo]] keyboard players improvised [[chord voicing]]s based on [[figured bass]] notation. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso [[cadenza]]s during concerts. However, in the 20th and early 21st century, as "common practice" Western [[art music]] performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role. At the same time, some modern composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In [[Indian classical music]], improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.

===Theory===
{{Main|Music theory}}
Music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the [[language]] and [[Musical notation|notation]] of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the [[parameter (music)|parameters]] or elements of music – rhythm, [[harmony]] ([[Diatonic function|harmonic function]]), [[melody]], structure, [[Musical form|form]], and [[Texture (music)|texture]]. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boretz |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Boretz |title=Meta-Variations: studies in the foundations of musical thought… |publisher=Open Space |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who study these properties are known as music theorists. Some have applied [[acoustics]], [[human physiology]], and [[psychology]] to the explanation of how and why music is [[perceive]]d.

==Elements==
{{main|Aspect of music}}
Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of "element" being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. Below is a list of the three official versions of the "elements of music":

In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: "appropriate [[musical notation]]s" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the "elements of music" to the "inter-related dimensions of music". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.&lt;ref&gt;Gov.uk. (2013). ''National curriculum in England: music programmes of study''. Retrieved 6 January 2016, from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-music-programmes-of-study&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "the elements of music" is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the "rudimentary elements of music" and the "perceptual elements of music".

===Rudimentary elements===
In the 1800s, the phrases "the elements of music" and "the rudiments of music" were used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;Clementi, M. (1974). Introduction to the art of playing on the piano forte: Da Capo Pr. Cohen, D., &amp; Dubnov, S. (1997). [[Gestalt phenomena]] in musical texture: Springer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Niecks|first=Frederick|authorlink=Frederick Niecks|year=1884|title=A Concise Dictionary of Musical Terms|url=https://archive.org/details/concisedictionar00niec}}. {{cite journal|title=Review|journal=[[The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular]]|volume=25|number=498|page=473|doi=10.2307/3357513|date=1 August 1884|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=hvd.32044041113556;orient=0;size=100;seq=7;attachment=0|jstor=3357513|hdl=2027/uc1.b4284161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The elements described in these documents refer to aspects of music that are needed in order to become a musician, Recent writers such as Estrella &lt;ref&gt;Estrella, E. (2015). The Elements of music. Retrieved 15 Jan. 2015, 2015, from http://musiced.about.com/od/beginnerstheory/a/musicelements.htm&lt;/ref&gt; seem to be using the phrase "elements of music" in a similar manner. A definition which most accurately reflects this usage is: "the rudimentary principles of an art, science, etc.: the elements of grammar."&lt;ref&gt;Element. (n.d.). In Dictionary.com unabridged.   Retrieved 10 Jun 2015, from  http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/element&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's curriculum switch to the "inter-related dimensions of music" seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.

===Perceptual elements===
Since the emergence of the study of [[psychoacoustics]] in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we ''hear'' music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book ''Psychology of Music'',&lt;ref&gt;Seashore, C. E. (1938). ''Psychology of music'': New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; identified four "psychological attributes of sound". These were: "pitch, loudness, time, and timbre" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). He did not call them the "elements of music" but referred to them as "elemental components" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: "Pitch" and "timbre" match exactly, "loudness" links with dynamics and "time" links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase "the elements of music" links more closely with ''Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary'' definition of an element as: "a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods"&lt;ref&gt;Webster, N. (Ed.) (1947) Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary. Clevelend Ohio: The World Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.

Although writers of lists of "rudimentary elements of music" can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.

===Analysis of styles===
[[File:George Clinton 2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. Pictured are the influential funk musicians [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament Funkadelic]] in 2006.]]
Some styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. To give one example, while [[Bebop]]-era [[jazz]] makes use of very complex chords, including [[altered dominant]]s and challenging [[chord progression]]s, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, [[funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. While Romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire Baroque dance suites for [[harpsichord]] from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. To give another example, while some [[art music]] pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] are very long, some pop songs are just a few minutes long.

===Description of elements===

====Pitch and melody====
[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is "higher" or "lower" than another musical sound, note or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high [[piccolo]] note or [[whistling]] tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a [[bass drum]]. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]]. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano  than to try to discern the pitch of a [[crash cymbal]] that is struck.
[[File:Popgoesweasel.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|The melody to the traditional song "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]"  {{audio|Pop Goes the Weasel.ogg|Play}}]]

A [[melody]] (also called a "tune") is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or [[key (music)|key]] of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C; these are the "[[white notes]]" on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, [[Bebop]]-era jazz from the 1940s and [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many [[chromatic note]]s (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the "white notes" and "black notes" and unusual scales, such as the [[whole tone scale]] (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}}). A low, deep musical line played by bass instruments such as double bass, electric bass or [[tuba]] is called a [[bassline]].

====Harmony and chords====
[[File:Sol7 accordo chitarra G7 guitar chord.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|When musicians play three or more different [[Musical note|notes]] at the same time, this creates a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. In [[Western culture#Music|Western music]], including classical music, pop music, rock music and many related styles, the most common chords are [[triad (music)|triads]]– three notes usually played at the same time. The most commonly used chords are the [[major chord]] and the [[minor chord]]. An example of a major chord is the three pitches C, E and G. An example of a minor chord is the three pitches A, C and E. (Pictured is a [[guitar player]] performing a chord on a guitar).]]
[[Harmony]] refers to the "vertical" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time to create a [[chord (music)|chord]]. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor [[tonality]] ("keys"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the "home note" or [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820–1900) often contains multiple keys, as does [[jazz]], especially [[Bebop]] jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or "home note" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.

====Rhythm====
Rhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] animates time in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]], which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as [[Waltz]] time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the [[backbeat]] used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or [[common time]]) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the [[snare drum]], a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the [[rhythm section]], which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], double bass) and a drum kit player.

====Texture====
[[Musical texture]] is the overall sound of a piece of music or song.  The texture of a piece or sing is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between [[part (music)|parts]] or lines of music:
* [[monophony]]: a single [[melody]] (or "tune") with neither instrumental [[accompaniment]] nor a [[harmony part]]. A mother singing a [[lullaby]] to her baby would be an example.
* [[heterophony]]: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] to the melody. Two [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]]s playing the same [[traditional music|traditional]] fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody a bit and each add different ornaments.
* [[polyphony]]: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. [[Choir|Choral]] music written in the [[Renaissance music]] era was typically written in this style. A [[round (music)|round]], which is a song such as "[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]", which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is a simple example of polyphony.
* [[homophony]]: a clear melody supported by [[chord (music)|chordal]] [[accompaniment]]. Most Western [[popular music]] songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.

Music that contains a large number of independent [[Part (music)|parts]] (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a "thicker" or "denser" texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo [[flute]] melody accompanied by a single cello).

====Timbre or "tone color"====
Timbre, sometimes called "color" or "tone color" is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Harnsberger, Lindsey. "Articulation." ''Essential Dictionary of Music''. Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. Los Angeles, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440&amp;nbsp;Hz A note sounds different when it is played on [[oboe]], piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different [[embouchure]]s), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., [[gut string]]s versus [[steel strings]]). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).

The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the [[spectrum]], [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] and [[overtone]]s of a note or musical sound. For [[music technology (electric)|electric]] instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and [[electric piano]], the performer can also change the tone by adjusting [[Graphic equalizer|equalizer controls]], tone controls on the instrument, and by using [[effects unit|electronic effects units]] such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedals. The tone of the electric [[Hammond organ]] is controlled by adjusting [[Hammond organ#Drawbars|drawbars]].

====Expression====
[[File:20110921-FSIS-RBN-6084 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Singers add expression to the melodies they sing using many methods, including changing the tone of their singing, adding [[vibrato]] to certain notes, and emphasizing important words in the lyrics.]]
Expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], by adding effects such as [[vibrato]] (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., [[ritardando]] or [[Tempo|accelerando]], which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or [[fermata]]s on a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more [[legato]], which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter).

Expression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato,  etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements in order to convey "an indication of mood, spirit, character etc." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=the definition of expression |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/expression |website=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burton |first1=Russell |title=The elements of music: What are they, and who cares? |journal=Educating for Life. ASME XXTH National Conference Proceeding. Australian Society for Music Education. |date=2015 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be considered an important rudimentary element of music.

In music, [[Musical form|form]] describes how  the overall structure or plan of a song or piece of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schmidt-Jones |first=Catherine |title=Form in Music |url=http://cnx.org/content/m10842/2.14/ |website=Connexions |accessdate=11 September 2011 |date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it describes the layout of a composition as divided into sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brandt |first=Anthony |title=Musical Form |url=http://cnx.org/content/m11629/1.13/ |publisher=Connexions |accessdate=11 September 2011 |date=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs and [[Musical theatre|Broadway musical]] songs were often in [[AABA form|AABA]] [[32 bar form]], in which the A sections repeated the same eight bar melody and the B section provided a contrasting melody and/or harmony for 8 bars. From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in [[verse-chorus form]], which is based around a sequence of [[verse (popular music)|verse]] and [[chorus (song)|chorus]] ("refrain") sections, with new [[lyrics]] for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of [[strophic form]], sometimes in conjunction with the [[twelve bar blues]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as "a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1=Percy Scholes |title=The Oxford Companion to Music |edition=10 |year=1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Form |ref=CITEREFScholes1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of common forms of Western music include the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]], [[Canon (music)|canon]], [[strophic]], [[theme and variations]], and [[rondo]].
Scholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and [[fugue]] (although musicologist [[Alfred Mann (musicologist)|Alfred Mann]] emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Alfred |title=The Study of Fugue |year=1958 |publisher=W.W.Norton and Co. Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Where a piece cannot readily be broken down into sectional units (though it might borrow some form from a poem, story or [[Programme music|programme]]), it is said to be [[through-composed]]. Such is often the case with a [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]], [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]], [[etude]] (or study), [[symphonic poem]], [[Bagatelle (music)|Bagatelle]], [[impromptu]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as "sectional, developmental, or variational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keil |first=Charles |title=Urban blues |url=https://archive.org/details/urbanblues0000keil |url-access=registration |year=1966 |isbn=978-0-226-42960-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sectional form
This form is built from a sequence of clear-cut units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wennerstrom |first=Mary |editor=Wittlich, Gary |title=Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music |year=1975 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-049346-0 |chapter=Form in Twentieth Century Music |ref=CITEREFDeLone1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be referred to by letters but also often have generic names such as [[Introduction (music)|introduction]] and [[Coda (music)|coda]], exposition, development and [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], verse, chorus or [[refrain]], and [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Introductions and codas, when they are no more than that, are frequently excluded from formal analysis. All such units may typically be eight measures long. Sectional forms include:

;Strophic form
This form is defined by its "unrelieved repetition" ('''AAAA'''...).

;Medley

[[Medley (music)|Medley]], [[Potpourri (music)|potpourri]] is the extreme opposite, that of "unrelieved variation": it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections ('''ABCD'''...), sometimes with repeats ('''AABBCCDD'''...).  Examples include orchestral [[overture]]s, which are sometimes no more than a string of the best tunes of the musical theatre show or opera to come.

;Binary form
[[File:Binary form.png|thumb|Binary form in major and minor keys. Each section must be at least three phrases long.&lt;ref&gt;White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p. 50. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

This form uses two sections ('''AB'''...), each often repeated ('''AABB'''...). In 18th-century Western classical music, "simple binary" form was often used for dances and carried with it the convention that the two sections should be in different [[musical key]]s but same rhythm, duration and tone. The alternation of two tunes gives enough variety to permit a dance to be extended for as long as desired.
b
;Ternary form
This form has three parts. In Western classical music a simple ternary form has a third section that is a recapitulation of the first ('''ABA'''). Often, the first section is repeated ('''AABA'''). This approach was popular in the 18th-century operatic [[aria]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and was called ''[[da capo]]'' (i.e. "repeat from the top") form. Later, it gave rise to the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar song]], with the '''B''' section then often referred to as the "middle eight". A song has more need than a dance of a self-contained form with a beginning and an end of course.

;Rondo form
This form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called "episodes". It may be asymmetrical ('''ABACADAEA''') or symmetrical ('''ABACABA'''). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a "development" of it. A similar arrangement is the [[ritornello]] form of the Baroque [[concerto grosso]]. [[Arch form]] ('''ABCBA''') resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme. It is normally used in a round.

;Variational form
Variational forms are those in which variation is an important formative element.

'''[[Theme and Variations]]:''' a [[theme (music)|theme]], which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only "section" and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A, B, A, F, Z, A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the [[Passacaglia]] and [[Chaconne]], was that of the [[ground bass]] – a repeating bass theme or ''basso [[ostinato]]'' over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning [[polyphony|polyphonic]] or [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] threads, or improvising [[division (music)|divisions]] and [[descant]]s. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form ''par excellence'' of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The [[Rondo]] is often found with sections varied ('''AA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''') or ('''ABA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A''').

;Developmental form
Developmental forms are built directly from smaller units, such as [[motif (music)|motifs]]. A well-known Classical piece with a motif is [[Beethoven's fifth symphony]], which starts with three short repeated notes and then a long note. In Classical pieces that are based on motifs, the motif is usually combined, varied and worked out in different ways, perhaps having a symmetrical or arch-like underpinning and a progressive development from beginning to end. By far the most important developmental form in Western classical music is [[Sonata form]].
This form, also known as ''sonata'' form, first movement form, compound binary, ternary and a variety of other names,{{Such as?|date=September 2011}} developed from the binary-formed dance movement described above but is almost always cast in a greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions of ''Exposition, Development'' and ''Recapitulation''. Usually, but not always, the "A" parts ([[Exposition (music)|Exposition]] and [[Recapitulation (music)|Recapitulation]], respectively) may be subdivided into two or three [[theme (music)|themes]] or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the "B" part (the [[musical development|development]]) – thus e. g. (AabB[dev. of a and/or b]A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;ab&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+coda). This developmental form is generally confined to certain sections of the piece, as to the middle section of the first movement of a sonata, though 19th-century composers such as Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner made valiant efforts to derive large-scale works purely or mainly from the motif.

It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or musical genres. Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12) as does European-influenced music. [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]] is the music of [[Iran|Persia]] and Persian language countries: ''musiqi'', the science and art of music, and ''muzik'', the sound and performance of music (Sakata 1983).

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture have discovered common links in theatrical and musical activity between the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] and those of later [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a "social phenomenon called [[litany]]," a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, "Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"] ''The Journal of Religion and Theatre'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"While Genesis 4.21 identifies Jubal as the "father of all such as handle the harp and pipe," the Pentateuch is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel. Then, in I Samuel 10 and the texts that follow, a curious thing happens. "One finds in the biblical text," writes Alfred Sendrey, "a sudden and unexplained upsurge of large choirs and orchestras, consisting of thoroughly organized and trained musical groups, which would be virtually inconceivable without lengthy, methodical preparation." This has led some scholars to believe that the prophet Samuel was the patriarch of a school, which taught not only prophets and holy men, but also sacred-rite musicians. This public music school, perhaps the earliest in recorded history, was not restricted to a priestly class—which is how the shepherd boy David appears on the scene as a minstrel to King Saul."&lt;ref name=JRT/&gt;

The [[Medieval Music|medieval]] era (476 to 1400), which took place during the [[Middle Ages]], started with the introduction of [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. [[Musical notation]] was used since Ancient times in [[Ancient Greece|Greek culture]], but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the [[Catholic church]] so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the [[monophony|monophonic]] [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called [[Gregorian chant]].&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs).

[[Renaissance music]] (c. 1400 to 1600) was more focused on secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.

The [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe; and during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.&lt;ref name="sdsu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Lucio Vivaldi]].

[[File:Mozart family crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (seated at the keyboard) was a [[child prodigy]] virtuoso performer on the piano and violin. Even before he became a celebrated composer, he was widely known as a gifted performer and improviser.]]
The music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] should not be confused with Classical music in general, a term which refers to Western [[art music]] from the 5th century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods).  Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the [[Baroque music]] which preceded it. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the [[fortepiano]], the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the Baroque era [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] as the main keyboard instrument.

Importance was given to [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the concerto, and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used [[chamber music]] and orchestra became more standardized. In place of the [[basso continuo]] group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a [[string quartet]] would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The Baroque era improvised chord-playing of the continuo keyboardist or lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800.

One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being  permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as opera and [[oratorio]] became more popular.

The best known composers of Classicism are [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.

===Romanticism===

[[Romantic music]] (c. 1810 to 1900) from the 19th century had many elements in common with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as [[Wagner]] and [[Brahms]] attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.

Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music, exploring new styles and themes.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

In the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound "colours". The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and the [[industrial revolution]] helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do [[urban culture|urban]] society. It also saw a new diversity in [[theatre music]], including [[operetta]], and [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] and other forms of musical theatre.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===20th and 21st century music===
{{Main|20th-century music}}

In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other common instruments, such as violin. With [[20th-century music]], the invention of new [[music technology (electric)|electric technologies]] such as [[radio broadcasting]] and the [[mass market]] availability of [[gramophone record]]s meant that [[sound recording]]s of songs and pieces heard by listeners (either on the radio or on their record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music, because whereas in the 19th century, the focus on sheet music restricted access to new music to the middle class and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments, in the 20th century, anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[big band]]s right in their own living room. This allowed lower-income people, who would never be able to afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. It also meant that people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.

The focus of [[art music]] in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of [[World War I]] influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. [[Traditional music]] styles such as [[jazz]] and [[folk music]] were used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the [[multitrack recording]] system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.

[[Jazz]] evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century, rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of [[Music of Africa|African]] and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of [[blue note]]s, [[improvisation]], [[polyrhythm]]s, [[syncopation]], and the [[swung note]].&lt;ref&gt;Alyn Shipton, ''A New History of Jazz'', 2nd. ed., Continuum, 2007, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock music is a genre of [[popular music]] that developed in the 1960s from 1950s [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], and [[country music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19838/m1/ |title=Show 55 – Crammer: A lively cram course on the history of rock and some other things |show=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong [[Backbeat (music)|back beat]] laid down by a [[rhythm section]] of electric bass guitar, drums, and keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, [[analog synthesizer]]s and digital ones and computers since the 1990s. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its "purest form," it "has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody."

==Performance==
{{Main|Performance}}
[[File:Naxi Musicians I.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Nakhi|Naxi]] musicians]]

Performance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or when a piano piece, electric guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other [[Part (music)|musical part]] is played by musicians. In classical music, a musical work is written in [[music notation]] by a composer and then it is performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a [[cover song]], they can make changes to it such as adding a [[guitar solo]] to or inserting an introduction.

A performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)—which is the norm in classical music, with jazz [[big band]]s and many popular music styles–or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] over a [[chord progression]] (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small [[jazz]] and [[blues]] groups. Rehearsals of orchestras, [[concert band]]s and [[choir]]s are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung and/or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Improvisation is the creation of a musical idea–a melody or other musical line–created on the spot, often based on scales or pre-existing melodic [[riff]]s.

Many cultures have strong traditions of solo performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in [[Bali]], include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organised performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical music festivals or [[music competition]]s. [[Chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works.

===Oral and aural tradition===
Many types of music, such as traditional [[blues]] and [[folk music]] were not written down in [[sheet music]]; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down [[oral history|orally]], from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song "[[Playing by ear (music)|by ear]]". When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as "traditional" or as a "folk song". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song.

===Ornamentation===
{{Main|Ornament (music)}}
[[File:Trill example ornaments.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|In a score or on a performer's music part, this sign indicates that the musician should perform a [[trill (music)|trill]]—a rapid alternation between two notes. {{audio|Trill example ornaments.mid|Play}}]]
In music, an "ornament" is a decoration to a melody, bassline or other musical part. The detail included explicitly in the [[Musical notation|music notation]] varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th centuries required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th centuries, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody. However, performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments to add interest to the music, such as [[Trill (music)|trills]] and [[Turn (music)#Turn|turns]].

In the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, [[accent (music)|accentuation]], and [[Rest (music)|pauses]] (among other devices) to obtain this "expressive" performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece.

==Philosophy and aesthetics==
{{Main|Philosophy of music|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Boldini, Woman in Red.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A painting by [[Boldini]] of a woman playing the piano]]

[[Philosophy of music]] is a subfield of philosophy. The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]].
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:

* What is the [[definition of music]]? (What are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between [[music and mind]]?
* What does [[musical history]] reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between [[music and emotions]]?
* What is meaning in relation to music?

In ancient times, such as with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], the [[aesthetics of music]] explored the mathematical and [[cosmological]] dimensions of [[rhythm]]ic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning [[sensory perception]], received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to [[express emotion]] has been a central issue.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a [[music critic]] and [[musicologist]], and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether music can express meaning. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a scale called [[just intonation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

It is often thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The [[philosopher]] [[Plato]] suggests in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

==Psychology==
{{Main|Music psychology}}

Modern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical [[behavior]] and [[experience]].&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |page=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this field and its subfields are primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[human subject research|human participants]]. In addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes, music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], skill, [[intelligence]], creativity, and [[social behavior]].

===Cognitive neuroscience of music===
{{Main|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
[[File:Brodmann 41 42.png|right|upright=1.15|thumb|The [[primary auditory cortex]] is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution.]]

[[Cognitive neuroscience]] of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

Many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory, community-based activity.&lt;ref&gt;Grazian, David. "The Symbolic Economy of Authenticity in the Chicago Blues Scene." in Music Scenes: Local, Translocal, and Virtual. ed. Bennett, Andy and Richard A. Peterson. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 2004. pp. 31–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Elizabeth Ball (2010). [https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&amp;context=open_access_etds Portland's Independent Music Scene: Formation of Community Identities and Alternative Urban Cultural Landscapes], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert, forming a [[music community]], which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a "[[high culture]]" and "[[low culture]]." "High culture" types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.

Other types of music—including, but not limited to, jazz, blues, [[soul music|soul]], and [[country music|country]]—are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between "high" and "low" musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced "art music" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between "high" and "low" musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the [[socioeconomic]]s standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-"art" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, [[Punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], or [[ska]] may be very complex and sophisticated.

When composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, [[serialism]], [[bebop]]-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and [[electronica]] have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Such themes are examined in the sociology of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called [[sociomusicology]], is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of [[ethnomusicology]].

===Role of women===
{{Main|Women in music}}
[[File:Julius Giere - Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren (Lithographie 1835).jpg|thumb|right|19th-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]].]]
Women have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], singers, conductors, [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements, events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.

Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol. 4, no. 1 (2014) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s pop-music scene, "[l]ike most aspects of the...music business, [in the 1960s,] songwriting was a male-dominated field. Though there were plenty of female singers on the radio, women ...were primarily seen as consumers:... Singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument, writing songs, or producing records simply wasn't done."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Erika White |url=http://www.rebeatmag.com/music-history-primer-3-pioneering-female-songwriters-of-the-60s/ |title=Music History Primer: 3 Pioneering Female Songwriters of the '60s &amp;#124; REBEAT Magazine |publisher=Rebeatmag.com |date=2015-01-28 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young women "...were not socialized to see themselves as people who create [music]."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"/&gt;

Women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, [[Music producer|music producing]], and [[sound engineering]]. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women [[musicology|musicologists]], women became involved in [[music education]] "...to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song |page= 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "...too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "...to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"&gt;http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |date=2016-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt;
According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jessica Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most recorded artists is [[Asha Bhosle]], an Indian singer best known as a playback singer in Hindi cinema.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Media and technology==
{{Further|Computer music|Music technology}}

[[File:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Music production in the 2000s using a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with an electronic keyboard and a [[multi-monitor]] set-up.]]
The music that composers make can be heard through several media; the most traditional way is to hear it live, in the presence of the musicians (or as one of the musicians), in an outdoor or indoor space such as an amphitheatre, [[concert hall]], [[cabaret]] room or [[theatre music|theatre]]. Since the 20th century, live music can also be broadcast over the radio, television or the Internet, or [[sound recording|recorded]] and listened to on a [[CD player]] or Mp3 player. Some musical styles focus on producing a sound for a performance, while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played "live." Recording, even of essentially live styles such as rock, often uses the ability to edit and splice to produce recordings that may be considered "better" than the actual performance.

[[Music technology|Technology]] has had an influence on music since prehistoric times, when cave people used simple tools to bore holes into bone flutes 41,000 years ago. Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the [[printing press]] in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder piano and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. In the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as [[sound film|talking pictures]] emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |title=American Federation of Musicians/History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405035855/http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |archivedate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and [[theater organ]]ists were common at first-run theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard (1985), p. 429.{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled "Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever"&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/ "Canned Music on Trial"] part of [[Duke University]]'s ''Ad*Access'' project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992 in the United States, and the 1979 revised [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in the United Kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and Internet in a form that is commonly known as [[Music-On-Demand]].

In many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often communal. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] or watching a music video, became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century.

Sometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a disc jockey uses [[gramophone record|disc records]] for [[scratching]], and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. Computers and many [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] can be programmed to produce and play [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) music. Audiences can also ''become'' performers by participating in [[karaoke]], an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.

===Internet===

The advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via [[streaming video]] and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], in his book ''[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]]'', suggests that while the traditional economic model of [[supply and demand]] describes scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. [[Data storage device|Digital storage]] costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole recording inventory available online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become economically viable to offer music recordings that very few people are interested in. Consumers' growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of thousands of [[niche market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (2006). The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. Hyperion. {{ISBN|1-4013-0237-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of the Internet arose with [[Virtual community|online communities]] and [[social media]] websites like YouTube and Facebook, a [[social networking service]]. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], in their book ''[[Wikinomics]]'', there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a "[[prosumer]]" role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of [[mashup (music)|mashes]], [[remix]]es, and music videos by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tapscott |first=Don |authorlink=Don Tapscott |author2=Williams, Anthony D. |authorlink2=Anthony D. Williams (author) |title=Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything |date=2006-12-28 |publisher=Portfolio Hardcover |isbn=978-1-59184-138-8|title-link=Wikinomics }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
[[File:Concerto music store, Utrechtsestraat 64, Amsterdam 5.jpg|350px|thumb|right|A music store selling various singles and albums]]
{{Main|Music industry}}

The music industry refers to the businesses connected with the creation and sale of music. It consists of songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces, music producers and [[sound engineer]]s who record songs and pieces, record labels and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishers]] that distribute recorded music products and [[sheet music]] internationally and that often control the rights to those products. Some music labels are "[[independent record label|independent]]," while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international [[media conglomerate|media groups]]. In the 2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on MP3 players, iPods, or computers, and of trading music on [[file sharing]] websites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business. Many smaller independent [[CD store]]s went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of CDs, and many labels had lower CD sales. Some companies did well with the change to a digital format, though, such as Apple's [[iTunes]], an [[online music store]] that sells digital files of songs over the Internet.

===Intellectual property laws===
{{Main||Royalty_payment#Music_royalties}}
In spite of some [[international copyright treaties]], determining which music is in the [[public domain]] is complicated by [[:Category:copyright law by country|the variety]] of national [[copyright law]]s that may be applicable.  [[US copyright law]] formerly protected printed music published after 1923 for 28 years and with renewal for another 28 years, but the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made renewal automatic, and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] changed the calculation of the copyright term to 70 years after the death of the creator. Recorded sound falls under [[mechanical licensing]], often covered by a confusing patchwork of state laws; most [[cover version]]s are licensed through the [[Harry Fox Agency]]. [[Performance rights]] may be obtained by either performers or the performance venue; the two major organizations for licensing are [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]. Two online sources for [[public domain music]] are [[International Music Score Library Project|IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project)]] and [[Choral Public Domain Library|Choral Public Domain Library (CPDL)]].

==Education==

===Non-professional===
{{Main|Music education}}
[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] violin recital with students of varying ages]]
The incorporation of some music or singing training into general education from [[Preschool education|preschool]] to [[Higher education|post secondary education]] is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, [[counting]], listening, and cooperation while also promoting understanding of [[language]], improving the ability to [[memory|recall]] information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Woodall and Ziembroski, 2002{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing [[hymn]]s and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as [[choir]]s (a group of singers), [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s, jazz bands, or orchestras. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private [[music lesson]]s after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about [[musical notation]] for [[musical scale]]s and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.

At the university level, students in most arts and [[humanities]] programs can receive [[Credit (education)|credit]] for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the [[history of music]], or a [[music appreciation]] course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta|Indonesian Institute of the Arts]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the [[music of Africa]] or Bali (e.g. [[Gamelan]] music).

===Professional training===

Individuals aiming to become professional musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, music teachers and practitioners of other music-related professions such as [[music history]] professors, [[sound engineer]]s, and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by colleges, universities and [[music conservatory|music conservatories]].  Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions, as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities, which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments), music history, music theory, music composition, [[music education]] (for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and, in some cases, conducting. On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., [[sound recording]]).

While most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music, there are a number of universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as [[jazz]] or [[popular music]] musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]]. Two important schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are [[McGill University]] and [[Humber College]]. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as [[heavy metal music]], [[country music]] or [[blues]] are less likely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas in colleges or universities. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing and/or playing in many bands (often beginning in amateur bands, [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s), studying recordings available on CD, DVD and the Internet and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal [[mentoring]] or regular [[music lesson]]s. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube "how-to" videos have enabled many singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with [[vocal coach]]es and [[singing teacher]]s.

====Undergraduate====
[[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate]] [[academic degree|university degrees]] in music, including the [[Bachelor of Music]], the Bachelor of Music Education, and the Bachelor of Arts (with a major in music) typically take about four years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can seek employment or go on to further study in music graduate programs. Bachelor's degree graduates are also eligible to apply to some graduate programs and [[professional school]]s outside of music (e.g., [[public administration]], [[business administration]], [[library science]], and, in some jurisdictions, [[teachers college|teacher's college]], [[law school]] or [[medical school]]).

====Graduate====
Graduate music degrees include the [[Master of Music]], the Master of Arts (in musicology, music theory or another music field), the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice (singing) or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a [[Dissertation|thesis]], is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, music theory or ethnomusicology.

The PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the [[Quadrivium]] of the seven [[liberal arts|Liberal Arts]] and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative Quadrivium, music, or more accurately [[harmonic]]s, was the study of rational proportions.

====Musicology====
[[Musicology]], the academic study of the subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: [[systematic musicology]], [[Music history|historical musicology]], and comparative musicology or [[ethnomusicology]]. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into [[music theory]], [[music history]], and [[ethnomusicology]]. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of [[psychoacoustics]]. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, [[music history]], and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD degrees.

====Music theory====
[[Music theory]] is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[anthropology]]. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the [[common practice period]], or [[Tonality|tonal music]]. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take many other forms. [[Set theory (music)|Musical set theory]] is the application of mathematical [[set theory]] to music, first applied to [[Atonality|atonal music]]. ''Speculative music theory'', contrasted with ''analytic music theory'', is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example [[musical tuning|tuning systems]], generally as preparation for composition.

====Zoomusicology====
[[Zoomusicology]] is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, "do animals have music?" [[François-Bernard Mâche]]'s ''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion'' (1983), a study of "ornitho-musicology" using a technique of [[Nicolas Ruwet]]'s ''Langage&lt;!--Langage=parlance or mode of speech--&gt;, musique, poésie'' (1972) [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic segmentation analysis]], shows that [[Bird vocalization|bird songs]] are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that "in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human."

====Ethnomusicology====
{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}
[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ethnomusicologist [[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief for the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] (1916)]]
In the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, which is known as classical music. The history of music in non-Western cultures ("[[world music]]" or the field of "ethnomusicology"), which typically covers music from
Africa and Asia is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different [[musical instrument|instruments]], techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for propaganda purposes, as was the case with [[Chinese opera]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

There is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the [[definition of music]]. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or "art" music), and popular music (or [[Contemporary commercial music|commercial music]] – including non-Western styles of rock, [[country music|country]], and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these "big two" classifications, (such as [[folk music]], [[world music]], or [[jazz]]-related music).

As world cultures have come into [[Globalization|greater global contact]], their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style contains elements from [[Folk Music of England|Anglo]]-[[Music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], Irish, [[Music of Germany|German]] and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic "[[melting pot]]" society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' are claimed by both opera and the [[Broadway musical]] tradition. Many current music festivals for non-Western music include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.

[[Music of India|Indian music]], for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]], [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]], and [[Dhrupad]] styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in [[South India]].

==Music therapy==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|right|A music therapist from a "Blues in the Schools" program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]
[[Music therapy]] is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, [[Exercise and music|support physical exercise]], and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.

One of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in [[Al-Farabi]]'s (c. 872–950) treatise ''Meanings of the Intellect'', which described the therapeutic effects of music on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haque |first1=Amber |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |url= |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [363] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' argued that music and dance were critical in treating [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], especially [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3,480, "Music a Remedy"&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that music has an "excellent power ...to expel many other diseases" and he called it "a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy." He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to "make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout."&lt;ref&gt;Ismenias the Theban, Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now thy do those, saith Bodine, that are
troubled with St. Vitus's Bedlam dance.

[[Albert Einstein]] had a lifelong love of music (particularly the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/einstein&amp;music.pdf |title=Einstein and his love of music |last=Foster |first=Brian |magazine=Physics World |date=2005 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; once stating that life without playing music would be inconceivable to him. In some interviews Einstein even attributed much of his scientific intuition to music, with his son Hans recounting that "whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or into a difficult situation in his work, he would take refuge in music, and that would usually resolve all his difficulties." Something in the music, according to Michele and Robert Root-Bernstein in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', "would guide his thoughts in new and creative directions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/imagine/201003/einstein-creative-thinking-music-and-the-intuitive-art-scientific-imagination |title=Einstein On Creative Thinking: Music and the Intuitive Art of Scientific Imagination|author1-last=Root-Bernstein|author1-first=Michele|author2-last=Root-Bernstein|author2-first=Robert |magazine=Psychology Today |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Einstein considered Mozart's music to reveal a universal harmony that Einstein believed existed in the universe, "as if the great Wolfgang Amadeus did not 'create' his beautifully clear music at all, but simply discovered it already made. This perspective parallels, remarkably, Einstein’s views on the ultimate simplicity of nature and its explanation and statement via essentially simple mathematical expressions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/06/the_musical_mind_of_albert_einstein.html |title=The Musical Mind of Albert Einstein: Great Physicist, Amateur Violinist and Devotee of Mozart |website=Open Culture |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review suggests that music may be effective for improving subjective sleep quality in adults with insomnia symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jesperson |first=Kira |date=13 August 2015 |title=Music for insomnia in adults |journal=The Cochrane Library |volume= |issue=8 |pages= CD010459|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010459.pub2 |pmid=26270746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Music is also being used in clinical rehabilitation of cognitive and motor disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322792.php|title=Why does bass make you want to dance?|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music theory''' is a set of systems for analyzing, classifying, and composing music and the elements of [[music]]. Narrowly it may be defined as the description in words of elements of music, and the interrelationship toward the [[music notation|notation]] of music and performance practice. Broadly, theory may be considered any statement, belief, or concept of the music ([[Benjamin Boretz|Boretz]], 1995). Thus academic study of music is called [[musicology]].

'''The OSYX''' is a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]] based [[post-punk]] band that formed in 2018. They have been described as, "largely raucous and at times silvery - with melodic tensions and chemistries, harmonies and howls that make you want to join the pack." in Curve Magazine. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.curvemag.com/Culture/The-OSYX-A-Post-Punk-Powerhouse/|title=The OSYX, A Post Punk Powerhouse|last=Staff|first=Curve|website=www.curvemag.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line up currently is Erin Frisby ([[Vocal music|vocals]], [[guitar]], [[Synthesizer|synth]], [[multi-instrumentalist]]), Ara Casey ([[Vocal music|vocals]], [[guitar]]), Selena Benally ([[Vocal music|vocals]], [[guitar]]), Robzie Trulove ([[Drum|drums]]) and Maya Renfro ([[bass]], [[guitar]], [[Vocal music|vocals]]). New Noise Magazine calls them "immensely collaborative, with some improvisation going on and anyone being able to bring ideas to the table for any song."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newnoisemagazine.com/interview-integral-to-the-scene-the-osyx/|title=Interview: Integral To The Scene: The OSYX|date=2019-10-11|website=New Noise Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band is named after and alpha female "[[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] wolf, The 06 (that’s the pronunciation oh-six), named after her birth year.

They are well informed about the issue(s) and also have a very strong opinion on it/them. They tend to know more about [[politics]] than the average person, and, therefore, [[wikt:exert|exert]] more influence, because these people care so deeply about their cause(s) that they donate a lot of time and money.

The '''two-step flow of communication model''' says that most people form their opinions under the influence of [[opinion leader]]s, who in turn are influenced by the [[mass media]]. In contrast to the one-step flow of the [[Hypodermic needle model|hypodermic needle model or magic bullet theory]], which holds that people are directly influenced by mass media, according to the two-step flow model, ideas flow from mass media to opinion leaders, and from them to a wider population. Opinion leaders pass on their own interpretation of information in addition to the actual media content.

== Basic overview ==
The theory is based on a 1940s study on social influence that states that media effects are indirectly established through the personal influence of opinion leaders. The majority of people receive much of their information and are influenced by the media secondhand, through the personal influence of opinion leaders.

== Concept ==
The two-step model says that most people are not directly influenced by mass media, and instead form their opinions based on opinion leaders who interpret media messages and put them into context. Opinion leaders are those initially exposed to a specific media content, and who interpret it based on their own opinion. They then begin to infiltrate these opinions through the [[general public]] who become "opinion followers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Stanley J.|last1=Baran|first2=Dennis K.|last2=Davis|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0767421906/student_view0/chapter12/glossary.html|title=Introduction to Mass Communication|chapter=Theories of Mass Communication: Glossary|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]]|location=New York City|date=2014|ISBN=978-1285052076|via=McGraw-Hill Online Learning Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "opinion leaders" gain their influence through more elite media as opposed to mainstream [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld 1955"&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence|newspaper=New York: Free Press|year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, [[social influence]] is created and adjusted by the ideals and opinions of each specific "elite media" group, and by these media group's opposing ideals and opinions and in combination with popular mass media sources. Therefore, the leading influence in these opinions is primarily a social persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Staubhaar, LaRose, Davenport|title=Media Now|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, Ca|isbn=978-0-495-56595-6|pages=415–416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About ==
The two-step flow of communication model hypothesizes that ideas flow from mass media to [[opinion leader]]s, and from them to a wider population.  It was first introduced by [[sociologist]] [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] ''et al.'' in 1944&lt;ref&gt;Paul Felix Lazarsfeld, [[Bernard Berelson]], Hazel Gaudet, ''The people's choice: how the voter makes up his mind in a presidential campaign'', Columbia University Press, 1944, p. 151''ff''&lt;/ref&gt; and elaborated by [[Elihu Katz]] and Lazarsfeld in 1955&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Elihu|last1=Katz  |authorlink1=Elihu Katz|first2=Paul Felix|last2=Lazarsfeld |authorlink2=Paul Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence: the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications|date=1955|isbn=978-1-4128-0507-0| pages=309''ff''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Elihu|last=Katz|authorlink=Elihu Katz|title=The Two-Step Flow of Communication: An Up-To-Date Report on a Hypothesis|journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford, England|volume=21|issue=1|date=Spring 1957|pages=61–78|jstor=2746790}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melvin DeFleur]] and [[Sheoron Lowery]] argue the book was much more than a simple research report: it was an effort to interpret the authors' research within a framework of conceptual schemes, theoretical issues, and research findings drawn broadly from the scientific study of small groups &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Melvin|last1=DeFleur|authorlink1=Melvin DeFleur|first2=Shearon|last2=Lowery|authorlink2=Sheoron Lowery|title=Milestones In Mass Communication Research|url=https://archive.org/details/milestonesinmass0000lowe|url-access=registration|chapter=Personal influence: Two-Step Flow of Communication|publisher=[[Longman|Longman Inc.]]|location=London, England|date=1983|ISBN=978-0801314377|page=[https://archive.org/details/milestonesinmass0000lowe/page/179 179]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[hypodermic needle model]], which considers mass media effects to be direct, the two-step flow model stresses human agency.

For example, in the field of [[science communication]], Matthew Nisbet describes the use of opinion leaders as intermediaries between scientists and the public as a way to reach the public via trained individuals who are more closely engaged with their communities, such as "teachers, business leaders, attorneys, policymakers, neighborhood leaders, students, and media professionals." Examples of initiatives that take this approach include Science &amp; Engineering Ambassadors, sponsored by the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and Science Booster Clubs, coordinated by the [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Ambassadors for Science: Harnessing the Power of Opinion-Leaders across Communities |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |publisher=[[Center for Inquiry]]|location=Amherst, New York|date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=30–31 |url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/ambassadors_for_science |accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lazarsfeld and Katz, mass media information is channeled to the "masses" through [[opinion leadership]]. The people with most access to media, and having a more literate understanding of media content, explain and diffuse the content to others.&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld"/&gt;

Based on the two-step flow hypothesis, the term "personal influence" came to illustrate the process intervening between the media's direct message and the audience's reaction to that message. Opinion leaders tend to be similar to those they influence—based on personality, interests, demographics, or socio-economic factors. These leaders tend to influence others to change their attitudes and behaviors. The two-step theory refined the ability to predict how media messages influence audience behavior and explains why certain media campaigns do not alter audiences' attitudes. This hypothesis provided a basis for the two-step flow theory of [[mass communication]].&lt;ref&gt;"Two Step Flow Theory." Opleidingswebsite Communicatiewetenschap (CW) En Communication Studies (CS).

=== Contemporary debate ===

In the times of digital social media, the more than six decade old theory sparks much new interest. The fact that massive databases are being used to send tailor-made messages to individuals lead back to the idea of a "one-step flow of communication".&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, W. L., &amp; Manheim, J. B. (2006). The One-Step Flow of Communication. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 608(1), 213–232. http://doi.org/10.1177/0002716206292266&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is a kind of [[Hypodermic needle model|Hypodermic needle / magic bullet model]], with the capacity of [[big data]] analytics informed [[mass customization]]. Empirical studies by other scholars, in contrast, have found that modern [[social media]] platforms, like [[Twitter]], exhibit clear evidence of a two-step flow of communication (see Figure).&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"&gt;Hilbert, M., Vasquez, J., Halpern, D., Valenzuela, S., &amp; Arriagada, E. (2016). [http://doi.org/10.1177/0894439316639561 One Step, Two Step, Network Step? Complementary Perspectives on Communication Flows in Twittered Citizen Protests].

The Two-Step Flow of Communication in Twitter-Based Public Forums. Social Science Computer Review, 0894439314556599&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[social media]] users obtain their news from [[celebrities]] or other amplifying opinion leaders, who again get informed by [[mass media]] or by individuals with specific insights. The fine-grained digital footprint of [[social media]] also suggests that there are more than simply the one-step and two-step modes of communication flow, leading the search for more complex '''Multistep Flow Models''' based on distinct network structures.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stansberry, K. (2012). One-step, two-step, or multi-step flow: the role of influencers in information processing and dissemination in online, interest-based publics.

== Lazarsfeld and Katz ==

Paul Lazarsfeld and Elihu Katz are considered to be the founders of functional theory and their book ''Personal Influence'' (1955) is considered to be the handbook to the theory.

=== Paul Felix Lazarsfeld ===
One of the first to embark on Communications research, was the first to introduce the difference between 'administrative research' and 'critical research' in regards to the media. Critical research he believed, criticizes the media institutions themselves for the perspective ways they serve dominant social groups. Critical research favors interperspective and inductive methods of inquiry.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Staubhaar, LaRose, Davenport|title=Media Now|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, Ca|isbn=978-0-495-56595-6|pages=404}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lazarsfeld's study of the 1940 presidential election was published as ''The People's Choice'' (1944). During the research revealed information about the psychological and social processes that influence voting decisions. The study also uncovered an influence process that Lazarsfeld called "opinion leadership." He concluded that there is a multistep flow of information from the mass media to persons who serve as opinion leaders which then is passed on to the general public. He called this communication process the "two-step flow of communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paul F. Lazarsfeld Biography|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/paul-f-lazarsfeld/|publisher=Book Rags Inc.|accessdate=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elihu Katz ===
[[Elihu Katz]] was a professor in the School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania when he collaborated with Lazarsfeld in 1955. Their research aimed to observe the flow of influence at the intersections of mass and interpersonal communication and resulted in the book ''Personal Influence''. Katz pursued Lazarfeld's research in a study of the flow of information, which is the basis of ''Personal Influence''. Katz and Lazarsfeld concluded that:
"... the traditional image of the mass persuasion process must make room for 'people' as intervening factors between the stimuli of the media and resultant opinions, decisions, and actions."&lt;ref name="Katz &amp; Lazarsfeld 1955"/&gt;

== Published works on the theory ==
=== ''The People's Choice'' ===
The presidential election of 1940 saw President Franklin Roosevelt seek an unprecedented third term in office. Funded by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, ''Life'' magazine, and the pollster [[Elmo Roper]], Columbia's Office of Radio Research conducted a study of voting. It was based on a panel study of 2,400 voters in Erie County, Ohio. Paul Lazarsfeld, [[Bernard Berelson]], and [[Hazel Gaudet]] supervised 15 interviewers, who from May–October interviewed the strategically selected 2,400 members of the community several different times in order to document their decision making process during the campaign. They focused on what factors would influence their decisions as the campaign progressed. ''The People's Choice'', a book based on this study presented the theory of  "the two-step flow of communications", which later came to be associated with the so-called "limited effects model" of mass media: the idea that ideas often flow from radio and print to local "opinion leaders" who in turn pass them on to those with more limited political knowledge, or "opinion followers." The results of the research led to the conclusion that sometimes person to person communication can be more effective than traditional media outlets such as newspapers, TV, radio etc. This idea developed further in the book ''Personal Influence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE ERIE COUNTY STUDY (The People's Choice)|url=http://www.outofthequestion.org/Media-Research-of-the-1940s/Trends.aspx|work=Media Research of the 1940s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Personal Influence'' ===
In 1944, Paul Lazarsfeld contacted McFadden Publications in regards to his first book, ''The People's Choice''. The two collaborated forming a mutually beneficial partnership in which Macfadden saw a way to financially profit from advertising to the female population and Lazarsfeld saw a way to gain more information on social influence. Out of this came the study conducted by the Bureau of Applied Social Research in which 800 female residents of Decatur, Illinois, where interviewed through panel interviews to discover what and who primarily influenced their decision making. Lazarsfeld worked with Robert Merton and thus hired C. Wright Mills to head the study. Another part of the research team, [[Thelma Ehrlich]] Anderson, trained local Decatur women to administer surveys to targeted women in town. By 1955. the Decatur study was published as part of Elihu Katz and Lazarsfeld's book ''Personal Influence''. The book concluded that ultimately, face to face interaction is more influential than traditional media influence and thus confirmed the two-step flow model of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE DECATUR COUNTY STUDY (Personal Influence)|url=http://www.outofthequestion.org/Media-Research-of-the-1940s/Trends.aspx|work=Media Research of the 1940s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
The original two-step flow hypothesis—that ideas flow from the media to opinion leaders and then to less active sections of the population—has been criticized and negated by myriad consequent studies. In 1960, findings from Deutschmann and Danielson assert, "we would urge that the Katz-Lazarsfeld two-stage flow hypothesis, as a description of the initial information process, be applied to mass communication with caution".&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Deutschmann, Wayne A. Danielson (1960) "Diffusion of Knowledge Of the Major News Story" Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly September 1960 vol. 37 no. 3 p345-355.&lt;/ref&gt; They find substantial evidence that initial mass media information flows directly to people on the whole and is not relayed by opinion leaders.

Furthermore, the two-step hypothesis does not adequately describe the flow of learning. Everett Rogers' "Diffusion of Innovations"&lt;ref&gt;Everett M. Rogers, Diffusion of Innovations, New York, Free Press of Glencoe, 1962, pp. 98-102&lt;/ref&gt; cites one study&lt;ref&gt;Lionberger, H. F. (1960). "Adoption of new ideas and practices: a summary of the research dealing with the acceptance of technological change in agriculture, with implications for action in facilitating such change" (No. 301.35 L763). Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in which two-thirds of respondents accredited their awareness to the mass media rather than face-to-face communication. Similarly, critics argue that most of Lazarsfeld's findings pertain to learning factors involved with general media habits rather than the learning of particular information. Both findings suggest a greater prevalence of a one-step flow of communication.

However, Lazarsfeld's two-step hypothesis is an adequate description to understand the media's influence on belief and behavior. Troldahl finds that media exposure is a first step to introduce discussion, at which point opinion leaders initiate the second-step flow.&lt;ref&gt;Troldahl, Verling C. "A Field Test of a Modified "Two-Step Flow of Communication" Model." Public Opinion Quarterly 30.4 (2001): 609-23. Academic Search Premier. Web. 11 Apr. 2010. &lt;http://web.ebscohost.com&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings also realize opinion leaders' decisive role in the balance theory, which suggests that people are motivated to keep consistency among their current beliefs and opinions. If a person is exposed to new observations that are inconsistent with present beliefs, he or she is thrown into imbalance. This person will then seek advice from their opinion leader, to provide them with additional cognitions to bring them back into balance. In addition, this theory may be valid during the era when opinion leaders were the only ones to have easy access to media contents. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Today, there is a free flow of information so that anybody could have access to media contents without relying substantially on opinion leaders.

[[Empirical research]] that analyzes vast databases from communication flows in [[social media]] finds that today's digital media landscape simultaneously facilitate one-step, two-step and more complex multi-step flow models of communication.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt; For example, in Twitter networks it is no contradiction that average Twitter users mainly mention intermediating opinion leaders in their tweets (two-step flow), while at the same time traditional mass media outlets receive 80-90 % of their mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from the same users.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt; This shows that the two-step model does not seem to be dead, nor obsolete, but simply one of several ways communication flows in modern networks.

      <text bytes="10223" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|Collective mood of a society's politics}}

The '''political climate''' is the aggregate mood and opinions of a political society at a particular time. It is generally used to describe when the state of mood and opinion is changing or unstable rather than in a state of equilibrium. The phrase has origins from both [[ancient Greece]] and medieval-era [[France]].

While the concept of a political [[climate]] has been used historically to describe both [[politics]] and public reactions to political actions in various forms, the naming of the concept by the addition of the modifier “political” to the base “climate” has been fairly recent. [[Public opinion]] is also widely used incorrectly as a synonym for political climate.

As for judging what the climate is at any given time, there is no way to know an entire country's views on certain subjects. So, [[Opinion poll|polls]] are used to estimate what the political climate "feels" like on a regular basis. However, this only works to some degree as polls cannot involve the entire population at once.

==Etymology==

===Climate===
According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the base climate comes from the Middle French ''climat'', which was first used to describe a region's prevailing weather conditions around 1314.&lt;ref&gt;"climate." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50041503?query_type=word&amp;queryword=climate&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-tXioM1-15462&amp;hilite=50041503&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first recorded uses of climate as a description of prevailing political attitudes was in The Vanity of Dogmatizing by [[Joseph Glanvill]] in 1661 where he mentions “divers Climates of Opinions”.&lt;ref&gt;Glanville, Joseph. The Vanity of Dogmatizing. London: H. Eversden, 1661. 227. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===
The modifier (''politic'' with the ''–al'' suffix) comes originally from the ancient Greek noun ''polis'' which referred to both a Greek city state, and the ideal state or government.&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary"&gt;"politic." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182868?query_type=word&amp;queryword=politic&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=T1SE-Cqhody-15489&amp;hilite=50182868&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, this evolved through the Latin noun ''politicus'' which is defined as the civil government,&lt;ref name="Oxford_English_Dictionary" /&gt; to the Middle French adjective ''politique'' which is the state of government, or relating to government.&lt;ref&gt;"polis." Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd. 3. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1989. Web. http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50182842?query_type=word&amp;queryword=polis&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;search_id=T1SE-DsbNxa-15502&amp;result_place=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

===Historical example===
{{Main|Trial of Socrates}}
[[File:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1787).]]

From 431 B.C.E to 404 B.C.E., ancient Greece was torn apart by the [[Peloponnesian War]] between [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. The History of the Peloponnesian War. Gutenburg: Project Gutenburg, 2009. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt; The war concluded with an Athenian defeat and several years of oppression by pro-Spartan rulers. By 399 B.C.E, Athens had returned to self-rule through revolution. At this time, Athens was undergoing social turmoil due to the apparent failure of democracy as an effective form of government, which created a public backlash against anything anti-democratic.

Socrates—the self-described "gadfly" of Athens because of his practice of ''elenchos'' (critical interrogation)—was seen by many as anti-democratic and thus a traitor to Athens due to his associations with Critias and Alcibiades (the former a Spartan supported tyrant, the latter a deserter to Sparta) and his frequent praises of the Spartan and Creten governments because of their similarity to many of his philosophical opinions on government.&lt;ref&gt;Bagby, Laurie. Political Thought: A Guide to The Classics. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Group, 2002. 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing political climate of distrusting anything remotely anti-Athens or anti-democracy coupled with attacks from Socrates's personal enemies led to the philosopher's execution by poison in 399 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Reeve, C.D.C. ''The Trials of Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
{{Main|Public opinion}}
The phrase originates from the French term ''opinion publique'', which was first attributed to [[Montaigne]], the father of modern [[Skepticism]] and a major figure of the [[French Renaissance]], around 1588 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, Wolfgang. ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication''. Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is generally used to describe the overall opinion of the public body about a certain issue. The phrase is commonly used interchangeably with political climate but the two actually refer to separate concepts. [[Public opinion]] is the aggregate logical thoughts that the public thinks and expresses about an issue (which does not have to be political in nature), while political climate is what the public's emotional reaction to those logical thoughts are.

Depending on the nature of the thoughts (if they are considered controversial or extreme), the emotional reaction can range from nothing to a highly violent state. Accordingly, controversial issues in the public eye are usually accompanied by or can even produce a polarizing political climate. For example, the introduction, passing, and court fight over [[Proposition 8]] in [[California]] brought a controversial issue into the public sphere, which resulted in such a drastic change in the political climate of the [[United States]] as to produce many protests throughout the nation, some of them violent.&lt;ref&gt;Dolan, Maura. "Prop. 8: Protesters on both sides of gay-marriage issue make their views known outside courthouse." Los Angeles Times 6 December 2010: Web. 8 December 2010. [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/demonstrators-proposition-8.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinion polls===
An [[opinion poll]] is a survey of public opinion from a particular group of people or sample. For determining the political climate, this usually would be a [[cross-sectional data|cross-section]] of the population in question. Opinion polls conduct series of questions and then extrapolate the average opinion of the sample according to their answers. However, opinion polls generally have appreciative margins of error because of the inability to survey the entire population and the improbability of surveying a perfectly random cross-section of the population. For example, the [[Wall Street Journal]] estimated in 2006 that the average margin of error is about 3-5% in opinion polls because of a wide variety of potential inaccuracies such as [[response bias]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref&gt;Bialik, Carl. "Grading the Pollsters." Wall Street Journal 16 November 2006: Web. 22 September 2010.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116360961928023945%23mod=2_1125_1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinion polls are also known to be entirely incorrect when predicting the outcome of certain events. The best-known example of this is the [[1948 US presidential election]], in which the prediction was that [[Thomas Dewey]] would easily defeat [[Harry Truman]]. Major polling organizations, including [[George Gallup|Gallup]] and [[Elmo Roper|Roper]], indicated a landslide victory for Dewey when, in fact, Truman was the victor in a close election and kept the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Crabtree, Steve. "Strom Thurmond and the 1948 Election." Gallup Brain: A Publication of Gallup, Inc. (2002): n. pag. Web. 8 Dec 2010.[http://www.gallup.com/poll/7444/gallup-brain-strom-thurmond-1948-election.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 saw the validity of opinion polls enter the debate once more, as polls in both the UK "[[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|Brexit]]" referendum and the [[2016 United States presidential election|US presidential election]] were ultimately shown to be largely incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/09/how-the-pollsters-got-the-us-election-wrong---just-like-brexit/|title=How the pollsters got the US election wrong - just like Brexit|newspaper=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls widely predicted a win for [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton]], while instead [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican candidate Donald J. Trump]] won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] and, therefore, the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/09/why-2016-election-polls-missed-their-mark/|title=Why 2016 election polls missed their mark|date=2016-11-09|newspaper=Pew Research Center|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="9319" xml:space="preserve">In social sciences, '''participation inequality''' consists of difference between levels of participation of various groups in certain activities. Common examples include:
* differing levels of participation in democratic, electoral politics, by social class, race, gender, etc.
* differing levels of participation in online communities as described by [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nielsen |first=Jakob |url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/participation_inequality.html |title=Participation Inequality: Encouraging More Users to Contribute |publisher=Useit.com |date=2006-10-09 |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In politics, participation inequality typically affects "the kinds of individuals, such as the young, the poor and those with little formal education"&lt;ref name="enumtoNRE"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irpp.org/choices/archive/vol9no7.pdf|format=PDF|title=From Enumeration to the National Register of Electors: An Account and an Evaluation|last=Black|first=Jerome H.|journal=Choices|volume=9|number=7|issn=0711-0677|date=7 August 2003|accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; who tend to not take the initiative to participate in electoral and related events. State enumeration, such as was done in Canada before the implementation of the [[National Register of Electors]] in 1996, "worked to augment voter turnout among all segments of society and thus mitigated a natural tendency toward participation inequality in electoral politics".&lt;ref name="enumtoNRE" /&gt;

== Political Participation Inequality ==
'''Political participation inequality''' refers to how populations differ in political participation when sorted by various characteristics. Most often these groupings are by social class, race, gender, or ethnicity. Widespread political participation inequality often describes when various groups are left out of the political sphere or excluded from various political rights.

Participation inequality usually helps political theorists determine where democracies fail or when political institutions are not democratically responsive. When political systems are too unequal in terms of political participation, it most generally means that there is a breakdown in the ability of all citizens to politically deliberate to distribute various scarce resources, implement comprehensive public policy, or enact needed social reforms. Nations with high amounts of participation inequality are generally characterized as undemocratic although there are certain nations, like India, where low participation inequality has not helped the democratic responsiveness of Indian institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahuja, Chhibber|first=Amit, Pradeep|date=2012|title=Why the Poor Vote in India: "If I Don't Vote, I Am Dead to the State"|url=|journal=Studies in Comparative International Development|volume=|pages=2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robert Dahl ===
[[File:Robert_Dahl's_Two-Dimensions.png|thumb|Robert Dahl's two dimensions for evaluating democracies/polarchies]]
In his 1971 paper ''Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition'', [[Robert A. Dahl|Robert Dahl]] provided a basic framework to evaluate democracies or polyarchies (nearly/almost full democracies) based on their participation inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Polyarchy: Participation and Opposition|last=Dahl|first=Robert|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=New Haven and London|pages=1–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that there are two dimensions: public contestation – the various rights and procedures guaranteed to citizens – and inclusiveness – how accessible these rights are to all citizens. More fully, public contestation describes the necessary functions for a liberal democracy: a competitive political atmosphere, ability to run for office, right to vote, right to assembly, etc. Inclusiveness describes what portion of the population is able to enjoy these rights and procedures.

Participation inequality is usually represented along the dimension of inclusiveness. So, if a nation were to allow only short people to vote, this political system would have a certain level of public contestation – the right to vote being available – and a certain dimension of inclusiveness – only short people being able to enjoy this right. This system of evaluating democracies enables comparisons of political regimes based on participation inequality by comparing inclusiveness between equally publicly contestable political systems.

=== Causes of Political Participation ===

==== Dahlian Causes ====
Using Dahl’s framework, the first cause of participation inequality can be rooted in a political system’s public policy or in the Dahlian dimension of inclusiveness. Policies that exclude groups based on ethnic identity such as old [[Apartheid South Africa|apartheid]] South Africa or Iranian exclusion of Sunni political parties best conveys systemic political exclusion that is rooted in a regime’s citizenship requirements or public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2016/04/29/4452814.htm|title=Political Identity and the Problem of Democratic Exclusion|date=2016-04-29|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Expansion of Dahl ====
[[File:Expansion_of_Dahl's_Theory.png|thumb|An expansion on Robert Dahl's two dimensions by adding a possible third dimension: institutions]]
The more insidious cause of participation inequality stems from a third dimension that has been recently added to Dahl’s two-dimensional evaluation of political systems: institutions. In this framework, '''institutions''' implement political rights and procedures guaranteed by the state. Institutional causes for participation inequality can include literacy tests, extensive citizenship requirements, sparse voting booths in rural or poor areas, and a lack of public transportation. These all affect the ability of citizens to properly exercise guaranteed rights like voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramakrishnan, Espenshade|first=S. Karthick, Thomas J.|date=September 2001|title=Immigrant Incorporation and Political Participation in the United States|journal=International Migration Review|volume=35|issue=3|pages=870–909|doi=10.1111/j.1747-7379.2001.tb00044.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional causes of participation inequality can also be mitigated or exacerbated by cultural norms. Most often high voter turnout usually is hailed as a marker for a democratically responsive nation; however, in [[India]] “the turnout rate among the poor is almost as high as for those who are either middle class or rich. A detailed study of voter participation reported for the 2009 national elections shows that voter participation rates do not seem to vary by income status at all...Recent studies report similar findings from Africa and Latin America (Bratton 2008; Boot &amp; Seligson 2008)”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of these studies conclude that in developing democracies voting acts as a reassurance of social status or worth in the eyes of the state. This cultural norm has not translated to more democratically responsive institutions in that “the governments created by these elections are known to neglect the interests of the poor and treat them disrespectfully compared to other income groups”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nations like India are considered to be exceptions to the general rule that economic status has some bearing on voter participation.

==== Economic and Educational Inequality ====
Economic inequality and educational inequality have often been pointed to as common culprits for political participation inequality. In large part, these two types of inequality are often created and reiterated by political institutions, but most political theorists differentiate these causes for political participation as separate, largely because they are not fully solved by changes in political institutions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Solt|first=Frederick|date=2008|title=Economic Inequality and Democratic Political Engagement|jstor=25193796|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=52|issue=1|pages=48–60|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2007.00298.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the outcomes of political institutions highly vary from regime to regime, most of the literature finds that high amounts of economic inequality in developed countries depress voter turnout for poorer individuals and increase voter turnout for more affluent individuals (this depends on social cohesion of societies, correlating negatively with affluent political participation when economic inequality is high).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other literature finds that educational inequality depresses voter turnout depending on one’s income level and perceived relative educational status (how one perceives one’s social status and others’ education levels).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persson|first=Mikael|date=March 2010|title=The Effects of Economic and Educational Inequality on Political Participation|url=https://ecpr.eu/Filestore/PaperProposal/a47c0359-276e-4a48-9c16-c46bd345968d.pdf|journal=University of Gothenburg Department of Political Science|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="3104" xml:space="preserve">A '''puppet ruler''' is a person who has a title indicating possession of [[political power]], but who, in reality, is controlled by outside individuals or forces.  Such outside power can be exercised by a foreign government, in which case the puppet ruler's domain is called a [[puppet state]].  But the puppet ruler may also be controlled by internal forces, such as non-elected officials.

== Examples ==
=== In Latin America ===
Governing through puppet presidents has long been a political tactic in [[Latin America]]. Many dictators and strongmen have formally handed over power to other officials for several reasons, often in order to follow constitutional provisions for elections and term limits, to provide a civilian façade for military rule, or to be able to go into semi-retirement away from the capital city. Strongmen who sometimes governed through figureheads included [[Diego Portales]] of [[Chile]], [[Rafael Núñez (politician)|Rafael Núñez]] of [[Colombia]], [[Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez]] of [[Costa Rica]], [[Fulgencio Batista]] of [[Cuba]], [[Ulises Heureaux]] and [[Rafael Trujillo]] of the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Gabriel García Moreno]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Raoul Cédras]] of [[Haiti]], [[Porfirio Díaz]] and [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] of [[Mexico]], the [[Somoza family]] of [[Nicaragua]], [[José Antonio Remón Cantera]], [[Omar Torrijos]] and [[Manuel Noriega]] of [[Panama]], [[Dési Bouterse]] of [[Suriname]], and [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]] and [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] of [[Venezuela]]. While figureheads who decided to act autonomously were often dismissed, on rare occasions the "puppets" later became significant political figures in their own right. For example, [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] turned against and exiled Calles to the United States and [[Joaquín Balaguer]] was elected to the Dominican presidency six times after the assassination of Trujillo.
=== Elsewhere ===

A puppet does not have to be a national ruler.  For example, [[Oscar K. Allen]] was widely recognized to be [[Huey Long]]'s puppet while serving as governor of [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5107&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Interwar period|the years before]] and during [[World War II]], [[Puyi]], the deposed [[Emperor of China]], is usually considered to have been the [[Emperor of Manchukuo|puppet ruler of]] [[Manchukuo]], a [[client state]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] on the Chinese mainland. &lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 298&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Win Myint (politician, born 1951)|Win Myint]], the current [[President of Myanmar|president]] of [[Myanmar]], is widely viewed by political commentators as a puppet president for [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who is constitutionally barred from holding the office of president.

[[The Washington Post]] has reported several times about suspicions and investigations of the 45th US President, Donald J. Trump, as Vladimir Putin's Puppet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/14/like-i-said-puppet-hillary-clinton-doubles-down-trump-russia/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[analogy]] typically includes reference to the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] head of [[government]] as [[head of state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Body politic: political metaphor and political violence |author=A. D. Harvey |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84718-272-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the analogy may also be extended to other anatomical parts, as in political readings of [[Aesop's fable]] of "[[The Belly and the Members]]".

A later [[Europe]]an reference to the concept appears in ''The Book of the Body Politic'' (1407) by poet and court writer [[Christine de Pizan]], in which she admits having borrowed the concept from a letter of [[Plutarch]]'s to the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]] but does not mention [[John of Salisbury]]'s work, ''[[Policraticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christine de Pizan]] ''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.xviii-xx Kate Langdon Forhan 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.3-5 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The metaphor appears in the French language as the ''corps-état''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Baecque|first1=Antoine|others=Trans.

The metaphor was elaborated in the [[Renaissance]], and subsequently, as medical knowledge based on [[Galen]] was challenged by thinkers such as [[William Harvey]].  Analogies were drawn between supposed causes of disease and disorder and their equivalents in the political field, viewed as [[Plague (disease)|plague]]s or infections that might be remedied with [[purgative|purges]] and [[Patent medicine|nostrums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Foreign bodies and the body politic: discourses of social pathology in early modern England |author=Jonathan Harris |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59405-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History: medieval origins==
{{Anchor|In statehood}} The term "Body politic" (the political body of [[society]]) derives from the mediæval political concept of the '''King's two bodies''' first noted by mediaevalist historian [[Ernst Kantorowicz]], as a point of theology as much as statehood. However, the person to give the concept some legal bite and codified reality, as much as legitimacy as well as sovereignty, was the 14th century judge Sir [[William de Shareshull]] in 1351 for the offence of high treason&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration what Offences shall be adjudged Treason. Compassing the Death of the King, Queen, or their eldest Son; violating the Queen, or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or his eldest Son’s Wife; levying War; adhering to the King’s Enemies; killing the Chancellor, Treasurer, or Judges in Execution of their Duty.

ITEM, Whereas divers Opinions have been before this Time in what Case Treason shall be said, and in what not; the King, at the Request of the Lords and of the Commons, hath made a Declaration in the Manner as hereafter followeth, that is to say; When a Man doth compass or imagine the Death of our Lord the King, or of our Lady his [Queen or of their eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do violate the King’s Companion or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or the Wife  the King’s eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do levy War against our Lord the King in his Realm, or be adherent to the King’s Enemies in his Realm, giving to them Aid and Comfort in the Realm, or elsewhere, and thereof be probably] attainted of open Deed by the People] of their Condition: . . . , and if a Man slea the Chancellor, Treasurer, or the King’s Justices of the one Bench or the other, Justices in Eyre, or Justices of Assise, and all other Justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their Places, doing their Offices: And it is to be understood, that in the Cases above rehearsed, that ought to be judged Treason which extends to our Lord the King, and his Royal Majesty" Treason Act 1351 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''1351 Treason''' Act 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the [[First Barons' War|Barons war]]. However, by the time of the fifteenth-century judge [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] the concept moves away from theology to [[jurisprudence]] in his ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy'', written from exile in about 1462 . Fortescue explains that the ''character angelus'' (divine character) of the king is his royal power, derived from angels and separate from the frail physical powers of his body.  However, he uses the phrase ''body politic'' itself only in its modern sense, to describe the realm, or shared rule, of [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]], mythical first king of England, and how he and his fellow exiles had covenanted to form a body politic. Unusually for the time, Fortescue was writing in English and not Latin: "made a body pollitike callid a reawme." The early medieval period (13th century) saw a general and radical shift in the idea of the political body and sovereignty and who was to be ultimate ruler of humankind. This constant shift in [[Translatio imperii]] and ''The Halo of perpetuity'' (Kantorowicz reasoning)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kings Two Bodies|last=Ernst|first=Kantorowicz|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=78–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; transformed the king's persona from [[Liturgy]] to legal science, argues Kantorowicz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The King's Two Bodies|last=Kantorowicz|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=87–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] proved one thing, quite surprisingly enough, the king was not the ultimate and major landowner with just 20% of land ownership as [[William the Conqueror]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Doomsday Of Crown Lands|last=Sidney J|first=Madge|publisher=Routledge|year=1938|isbn=|location=|pages=20–21|quote="Before the Norman conquest, therefore, it is possible to find a feudal edifice of at least four stages-first, the king as supreme lord;then the holders of "bocland"with their "courts", and the power of making separate grants; next the owners of "laenland", rendering military service and special dues;and lastly, the cultivators of the land (Feudal serfs) of two types, free and unfree.This division of the land before and after the (Norman) Conquest, worked out so carefully in 1867, but expressed in percentage form for the first time, reveals the curious fact that the Church(29.6%) alone gained by the Conquest, relatively speaking, the Crown(19.9%) and the Baronage(50.5%) showing proportionate losses in the new triangular balance of power."}}&lt;/ref&gt; found out to his disgust and chagrin, which ultimately led to the [[Domesday Book|Domesday book]] being compiled. With [[Plenitudo potestatis]], [[Unam sanctam]] (a [[papal bull]]) [[extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]] and the [[Sun and moon allegory]] now part of the armoury of jurisdictional power of the papacy with both [[canon law]], and medieval [[political theology]] now becoming (part of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] movement beginning with [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[John of Salisbury]]) a standard bearer for medieval political power which then descended into the infamous [[Inquisition]] and [[heresy]] (deviation from truth) as the ultimate legal reality which meant both the [[Roman catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and [[papal supremacy]] could not be ignored (not without fear of [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]] and in some cases judicial execution). The Church, which ultimately had powerful claims to sovereignty due to their immense wealth and vast monetary resources which included a clever taxation system establishing the legal validity of the [[tithe]] system which baffled legal experts of the day of its historical lineage and origin, such as Sir [[William Blackstone]], for example, not its legal validity; such as their (the Church's) enormous network and ownership of land, law making and the then-university and education system.

Under the India law the body politic, corporate, managing bodies, etc., and several other non-human entitles have been given the status of the "[[Legal person#india|legal person]]" with rights to sue and be sued.&lt;ref name=IndiaLaw&gt;[https://qz.com/india/1636326/who-apart-from-human-beings-are-legal-persons-in-india/ Birds to holy rivers: A list of everything India considers “legal persons”], [[Quartz (publication)]], September 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In 1550 the jurist [[Edmund Plowden]] merged Fortescue's concepts, at the same time removing them from abstraction into a real, physical manifestation in the body of the king. Plowden reports how lawyers codified this notion in an examination of a case of land-ownership turning on a disputed gift by an earlier monarch; they determined that the "Body politic…that cannot be seen or handled…[is] constituted for the direction of the People…[and] these two bodies are incorporated in one person…the Body politic includes the [king's] Body natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kantorowicz|first=Ernst H|authorlink=Ernst Kantorowicz|title=The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Mediaeval Political Theology|year=1957|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=978-0691071206|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1609 [[Attorney General]] [[Edward Coke]] pronounced his dissenting opinion,  that mortal power was God-made while the immortality of royal power existed only as a man-made concept; Coke later succeeded in limiting the royal power of both [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[James VI and I]] with his now infamous judgements of [[Case of Proclamations]]&lt;ref&gt;'''England and Wales High Court (King's Bench Division)''' ''Decisions Case of Proclamations [1610] EWHC KB J22 November 1610''&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''[[Petition of Right]]'', which triggered off the [[English Civil War]] and would have reverberations right across the country for the next 100 years. When the monarchy, in the person of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was [[Restoration (England)|restored]] at the end of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] the idea remained current and royalty continued to use the notion, as a buttress to its authority, until an assertion of the rights of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] brought about the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Kantorowicz (1957: 423)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olwig (2002: 102)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century English [[Barrister]] and judge Sir [[William Blackstone]] developed further the medieval idea and the legal argument  (which still stands today) of the monarch in legal terms "immortal" with added emphasis of a quasi divine (''character angelus'') status.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] (1765) ''Commentaries On The Laws of England: In Four Books'' p.196 Volume 1 "But, fourthly; however the crown may be limited or transferred, it still retains its descendible quality, and becomes hereditary in the wearer of it. And hence in our law the king is said never to die, in his political capacity; though,in common with other men, he is subject to mortality in his natural: because immediately upon the natural death of Henry,William, or Edward, the king survives in his successor.
For the right of the crown vests, eo instanti, upon his heir; either the ''hares natus'', if the course of descent remains unimpeached,or the ''hares factus'', if the inheritance be under any particular settlement. So that there can be no interregnum (7); but,as [[Sir Matthew Hale]] (b) observes, the right of sovereignty is fully invested in the successor by the very descent of the crown.And therefore, however acquired, it becomes in him absolutely hereditary, unless by the rules of the limitation it is otherwise ordered and determined. 
In the same manner as landed estates,to continue our former comparison, are by the law here hereditary, or descendible to the heirs of the owner; but still there exists a power, by which the property of those lands may be transferred to another person. If this transfer be made simply and absolutely (8), the lands will be hereditary in the new owner, and descend to his heir-at-law; but if the transfer be clogged with any limitations, conditions, or entails, the lands must descend in that channel, so limited and prescribed,and no other". 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ancient legal maxim is that ‘the King never dies’. According to Blackstone,”the King survives in his successor” and “the right of the Crown ''vests, eo instanti'', upon his heirs”. Thus in legal theory the monarch is regarded as immortal and there is no moment in which the throne is vacant”. [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] Fifth Edition ''Crown and Crown Proceedings'' pp.8-9 Volume 29 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=John Anthony|title=James I and Divine Right|publisher=Sophia University|location=Tokyo|oclc=41418652|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Revolution monarchs of France also claimed legitimacy on this principle, and extended it to include the idea that the king's heir assimilated the "body politic" of the old king, in a physical "transfer of corporeality", on accession.&lt;ref&gt;de Baecque (1997: 100–102)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="8282" xml:space="preserve">A '''parliamentary leader''' is a political title or a descriptive term used in various countries to the person leading a [[caucus]] (or [[parliamentary group]]) in a legislative body, whether it be a national or sub-national legislature. A [[party leader]] may be the same person as the parliamentary leader, or the roles may be separated.

==Terminology==
In many countries, the position of [[party leader|leader of a political party]] (that is, the organisational leader) and leader of a parliamentary group are separate positions, and while they are often held by the same person,&lt;ref name="Pilet–Cross"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pilet|first1=Jean-Benoit|last2=Cross|first2=William|title=The Selection of Political Party Leaders in Contemporary Parliamentary Democracies: A Comparative Study|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317929451|page=190|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_2mvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is not always or automatically the case. If the party leader is a member of the government, holds a different political office outside the parliamentary body in question, or no political office at all, the position of parliamentary leader is frequently held by a different person.&lt;ref name="Heidar"/&gt;

In English, the leader may be referred to as a "parliamentary chairman", "group leader"&lt;ref name="europarl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of the leaders of Parliament's political groups|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+IM-PRESS+20090710FCS58034+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en|date=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "parliamentary leader", among other names.

==Examples==
{{expand section|date=August 2017}}
===Canada===
{{See also|Interim leader (Canada)}}
A parliamentary leader is chosen in [[politics of Canada|Canadian politics]] to lead their [[caucus]] in a legislative body, whether it be the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] or a provincial legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffrey|first1=Brooke|title=Divided Loyalties: The Liberal Party of Canada, 1984-2008|date=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802038487|page=604|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BGdYR_ZTyRAC&amp;pg=PA604|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They serve as interim legislative leaders, when a party leader either has no seat in the legislative body, during a transition period preceding, or following a leadership contest.

===European Parliament===
Each of the seven [[political groups of the European Parliament]] has its own group leader. The groups within the European Parliament are often very broad, so the position of the group leader is a unifying one—they may help to consolidate MEPs with similar outlooks ahead of important votes.&lt;ref name="europarl"/&gt; The groups are organisationally separate from a [[European political party]], and multiple parties often ally as a single group, thus the distinction between a party and a parliamentary leader is usually strict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political groups in the European Parliament. Parties in EU.|url=http://www.itsyourparliament.eu/groups/|website=www.itsyourparliament.eu|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In German politics, leaders of the major parties have often been heads of government of the various states rather than members of the national parliament.&lt;ref name="Heidar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidar|first1=Knut|last2=Koole|first2=Ruud|title=Parliamentary Party Groups in European Democracies: Political Parties Behind Closed Doors|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134594764|page=33–34|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rgGDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the position of parliamentary leader in the [[Bundestag|federal parliament]] (Germany also has 16 state parliaments) is often occupied by a different person. The parliamentary leader has the supreme responsibility for coordinating the work of the MPs representing his or her party. Even when the party leader is a member of the national parliament, the parliamentary leader can be a different person. For instance,
[[Friedrich Merz]] was parliamentary leader while [[Angela Merkel]] was party leader for some years while the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] was in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geis|first1=Matthias|last2=Hildebrandt|first2=Tina|title=Angela Merkel: Not Our Ms. Merkel|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2015-09/angela-merkel-refugees-politics-germany-cdu/komplettansicht|work=[[Die Zeit]]|date=26 September 2015|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the party leader is the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] or a member of the government, another person always is the parliamentary leader.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===United Kingdom===
In [[politics of the United Kingdom|British politics]], the leader of a party is typically the same person as the parliamentary leader. The leader may not fully control the party bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Leach–Coxall–Robins"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leach|first1=Robert|last2=Coxall|first2=Bill|last3=Robins|first3=Lynton|title=British Politics|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230344228|page=102|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=l6McBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leader may be chosen by [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] from among their number, or elected by the wider party membership at a [[party conference]], but once elected must retain the support of the parliamentary party.&lt;ref name="Leach–Coxall–Robins"/&gt; Similarly, the position of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]] may be given to the parliamentary leader (viz. party leader) of the largest political party in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|parliament]], with the expectation they will be able secure and retain the [[confidence and supply|confidence]] of a majority of MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government and Opposition roles|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/|website=www.parliament.uk|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leyland|first1=Peter|title=The Constitution of the United Kingdom: A Contextual Analysis|date=2016|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781849469081|page=121|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V-8cDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT121|accessdate=17 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some smaller parties have parliamentary leaders in the national parliament (in Westminster) who are separate from the party leaders—the party leader may hold office in a [[devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] (sub-national) parliament or assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leonard|first1=Ian|title=Why does Nicola Sturgeon not have a seat in Westminster?|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nicola-sturgeon-not-seat-westminster-5665836|accessdate=17 August 2017|work=Daily Mirror|date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williamson|first1=David|title=Liz Saville Roberts is Plaid Cymru's new Westminster leader|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/liz-saville-roberts-plaid-cymrus-13186885|accessdate=17 August 2017|work=Wales Online|date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia and New Zealand===
In [[Politics of Australia|Australian]] and [[New Zealand politics]], the party figure commonly described as "leader" is usually an MP responsible for managing the party's business within parliament. Party constitutions will typically distinguish between the parliamentary leader and the organisational leader (who typically is outside of parliament), with the latter often termed a "federal president" or "party president".&lt;ref name="Pilet–Cross"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Labour Party Constitution and Rules|url=https://www.elections.org.nz/sites/default/files/Labour_Party_Rules_1.pdf|website=www.elections.org.nz|publisher=New Zealand Labour Party|accessdate=17 August 2017|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two roles are organisationally distinct even if close cooperation is expected.&lt;ref name="Pilet–Cross"/&gt;

      <text bytes="19986" xml:space="preserve">'''Political demography''' is the study of the relationship between politics and population change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Myron Weiner|Weiner, Myron]] and Michael S. Teitelbaum. 2001. ''Political Demography and Demographic Engineering''. New York: Bergahn Books; [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Goldstone, Jack A., Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft, ed. 2011. Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Population change is driven by classic [[Demographics|demographic]] mechanisms – birth, death, age structure, and migration. 

However, in political demography, there is always scope for assimilation as well as boundary and identity change, which can redraw the boundaries of populations in a way that is not possible with biological populations.&lt;ref&gt;Bookman, Milica Zarkovic. 1997. The demographic struggle for power : the political economy of demographic engineering in the modern world. London ; Portland, OR: Frank Cass&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, political-demographic projections can account for both demographic factors and transitions caused by social change. A notable leader in the area of sub-state population projection is the [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/POP/ World Population Program] of the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. 

Some of the issues which are studied in the context of political demography are: surges of young people in the developing world, significantly increasing aging in the developed world, and the impact of increasing urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 |title=Political Demography - Jack A. Goldstone; Eric P. Kaufmann - Oxford University Press |publisher=Oup.com |date=2011-12-31 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political demographers study issues like population growth in a political context. A population's growth is impacted by the relative balance of variables like mortality, fertility and immigration.&lt;ref name="sneps1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sneps.net/research-interests/political-demography-ethnicity-nationalism-religion |title=The Political Demography of Ethnicity, Nationalism and Religion &amp;#124; Eric Kaufmann |publisher=Sneps.net |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of the present world's most powerful nations are aging quickly, largely as a result of major decreases in fertility rates and major increases in life expectancies.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/political-demography-identity-institutions-and-conflict-book-launch |title=Political Demography: How Population Changes Are Reshaping International Security and National Politics |publisher=Wilson Center |date=2012-01-10 |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the labor pools in these nations shrink, and spending on the elderly increases, their economies are likely to slow down.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"/&gt; By 2050, the workforce in Japan and Russia is predicted to decrease by more than 30 percent, while the German workforce is expected to decline by 25 percent by that year.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"/&gt; The governments of these countries have made financial commitments to the elderly in their populations which will consume huge percentages of their national GDP.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"/&gt; For example, based on current numbers, more than 25% of the national GDPs of Japan, France and Germany will be consumed by these commitments by 2040.&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1"/&gt;

==Political demography and evolution==
Differential reproductive success is the mechanism through which evolution takes place. For much of human history this occurred through migrations and wars of conquest, with disease and mortality through famine and war affecting the power of empires, tribes and city-states. Differential fertility also played a part, though typically reflected resource availability rather than cultural factors.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. (1997). [[Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]]. New York: W.W. Norton; McNeill, William Hardy. 1976. Plagues and peoples. 1st ed. Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; Though culture has largely usurped this role, some claim that differential demography continues to affect cultural and political evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Michael. 2009. "'[http://www.blume-religionswissenschaft.de/pdf/ReproductiveReligiosityBlume2009.pdf The Reproductive Benefits of Religious Affiliation]'." In The Biological Evolution of Religious Mind and Behavior, ed. E. Voland and W. Schiefenhövel. New York: Springer-Verlag, pp. 117-26 (Blume 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uneven transition, democratization and globalization==
The demographic transition from the late eighteenth century onwards opened up the possibility that significant change could occur within and between political units. Though the writings of Polybius and Cicero in classical times bemoaned the low fertility of the patrician elite as against their more fecund barbarian competitors,&lt;ref name="autogeneratedci"&gt;Jackson, Richard, and Neil Howe. 2011. "'Global Aging And Global Security In The 21st Century'." in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; differential fertility has probably only recently emerged as a central aspect of political demography. 

This has come about due to medical advances which have lowered infant mortality while conquest migrations have faded as a factor in world history. Differences in immunity levels to infectious diseases between populations also play no major role in our age of modern medicine and widespread exposure to a common disease pool. 

It is not so much the trajectory of demographic transition that counts as the fact that it has become more intense and uneven in the late twentieth century as it has spread into the developing world. Uneven transitions lend themselves to differential growth rates between contending groups. These changes are in turn, magnified by democratization, which entrenches majority rule and privileges the power of numbers in politics as never before.

Indeed, in many new democracies riven by ethnic and religious conflicts, elections are akin to censuses while groups seek to 'win the census'. Ethnic parties struggle to increase their constituencies through pronatalism ('wombfare'), oppose family planning, and contest census and election results.&lt;ref&gt;Toft, Monica Duffy. 2011. "Wombfare: The Religious and Political Dimensions of Fertility and Demographic Change." in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]; Horowitz, D. 1985. Ethnic Groups in Conflict. Berkeley: University of California Press, esp. chapters 3-4,7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic, national and civilizational conflict===
One branch of political demography examines how differences in population growth between nation-states, religions, ethnic groups and civilizations affects the balance of power between these political actors. For instance, Ethiopia is projected to have a larger population than Russia in 2020, and while there were 3.5 Europeans per African in 1900, there will be four Africans for each European in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Demeny, P, and G. McNicoll, eds. 2006. The Political Economy of Global Population Change, 1950-2050. New York: Population Council&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wilsoncenter1" /&gt; Population has always counted for national power to some degree and it is unlikely that these changes will leave the world system unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Goldstone, Jack A., Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft, ed. 2011. Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]., 'Introduction'.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The same dynamic can be witnessed within countries due to [[Demographic threat|differential ethnic population growth]].&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb, Milton, and Victor Baras (eds). 1978. Zero Population Growth-For Whom?: differential fertility and minority group survival. Westport, CT: Praeger; Leuprecht, C. 2011. "'Deter or Engage?:Demographic Determinants of Bargains in Ethno-Nationalist Conflicts'." in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Irish Catholics in Northern Ireland increased their share of the population through higher birthrates and the momentum of a youthful age structure from 35 to nearly 50 percent of the total between 1965 and 2011. Similar changes, also affected by in- and out-migration, have taken place in, amongst others, the United States (Hispanics), Israel-Palestine (Jews and Arabs), Kosovo (Albanians), Lebanon (Shia, with decline of Christians) and Nagorno-Karabakh (Armenians). 

In the US, the growth of Hispanics and Asians, and Hispanics' youthful age profile as against whites, has the potential to tilt more states away from the Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;Frey, William H. 2011. "Racial Demographics and the 2008 Presidential Election in the United States " in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the fertility advantage of conservative over liberal white voters is significant and rising, thus the Republicans are poised to win a larger share of the white vote - especially over the very long run of 50 to 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;Lesthaeghe, R., and L. Neidert. 2006. "The Second Demographic Transition in the United States:. Exception or Textbook Example?" Population and Development Review 32 (4):669-98; Kaufmann, Eric, A. Goujon, and [[Vegard Skirbekk|V Skirbekk]]. 2011. "American political affiliation, 2003-43: A cohort component projection." Population Studies&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to London-based scholar [[Eric Kaufmann]], the high birth rates of religious fundamentalists as against seculars and moderates has contributed to an increase in religious fundamentalism and decrease of moderate religion within religious groups, as in Israel, the US and the Muslim Middle East. Kaufmann, armed with empirical from a number of countries, also posits that this will be further bolstered by the higher retention rates of religious fundamentalists, with individuals in religiously fundamentalist households less likely to become religiously non-observant than others.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Eric. 2011.

==Age structure and politics==
===Youth bulges===
A second avenue of inquiry considers age structures: be these [[Population pyramid|'youth bulges']] or aging populations. Young populations are associated with a ratio of dependents to producers: a high proportion of the population under age 16 puts pressure on resources. A 'youth bulge' of those in the 16-30 bracket creates a different set of problems.

A large population of adolescents entering the labor force and electorate strains at the seams of the economy and polity, which were designed for smaller populations. This creates unemployment and alienation unless new opportunities are created quickly enough - in which case a 'demographic dividend' accrues because productive workers outweigh young and elderly dependents. Yet the 16-30 age range is associated with risk-taking, especially among males.

In general, youth bulges in developing countries are associated with higher unemployment and, as a result, a heightened risk of violence and political instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Huntington | first1 = Samuel P | year = 1996 | title = The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order. | url = https://archive.org/details/clashofciviliza00hunt | url-access = registration | location = New York, NY|publisher= Simon and Schuster }}; {{cite journal | authorlink=Henrik Urdal |last1=Urdal|first1= Henrik|year= 2006| title = A Clash of Generations?

"The Age-structural Maturity Thesis: The Youth Bulge's Influence on the Advent and Stability of Liberal Democracy?" In [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population aging===
Population aging presents the obverse effect: older populations are less risk-taking and less prone to violence and instability. However, like those under-16, they place great strain on the social safety net, especially in countries committed to old-age provision and high-quality medical care. 

Some observers believe that the advent of a much older planet, courtesy of below-replacement fertility in Europe, North America, China and much of the rest of Asia and Latin America, will produce a 'geriatric peace'.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, M. L. 2007. "A geriatric peace? The future of US power in a world of aging populations." International Security 32 (1):112-32; Haas, Mark. 2011. "'America’s Golden Years?:U.S. Security in an Aging World'." in [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Politics/AmericanPolitics/PoliticalSociology/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199945962 Political Demography: How Population Changes are Reshaping National Politics and International Security, ed. J. A. Goldstone, Eric Kaufmann and Monica Duffy Toft. Oxford: Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others are concerned that population aging will bankrupt the welfare state and handicap western liberal democracies' ability to project power abroad to defend their interests. A more cautious climate could also herald slower economic growth, less entrepreneurship and reduced productivity in mature democracies.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedci" /&gt; 

It is also possible that ageing leads to lower inflation as elderly people are both inflation averse and politically powerful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vlandas|first1=T|title=Grey power and the economy: Ageing and inflation across advanced economies|journal=Comparative Political Studies |volume=51|issue=4|pages=514–552|date=2017|doi=10.1177/0010414017710261|url=http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/70761/1/vlandas_CPS_accepted_pre-proof_version.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some argue that older people in the developed world have much higher productivity, human capital and better health than their counterparts in developing countries, so the economic effects of population aging will be largely mitigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=[[Vegard Skirbekk|Skirbekk, Vegard]], Elke Loichinger and Daniela Weber|date=2011|title=Variation in cognitive functioning as a refined approach to comparing aging across countries|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/12/13/1112173109|accessdate=2013-10-06|doi=10.1073/pnas.1112173109|pmid=22184241|pmc=3271876|volume=109|issue=3|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=770–774|bibcode=2012PNAS..109..770S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other branches of political demography==
Other areas in political demography address the political impact of skewed [[sex ratio]]s (typically caused by female infanticide or neglect), [[urbanization]],&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Doug. 2010. Arrival city : how the largest migration in history is reshaping our world. New York: Pantheon Books&lt;/ref&gt; global [[Immigration|migration]],&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, Caroline, and James Frank Hollifield. 2008. Migration theory : talking across disciplines. 2nd ed. New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; and the links between population, environment and conflict&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/program/environmental-change-and-security-program |title=Environmental Change and Security Program |publisher=Wilson Center |date= 2011-03-31|accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emerging discipline==
The study of political demography is in its early stages and can be traced back to the works of figures such as Jack Goldstone, whom is often considered to be the father of Political Demography. Since 2000 the subject has drawn the attention of policymakers and journalists and is now emerging as an academic subfield. Panels on political demography appear at demography conferences such as the [http://www.populationassociation.org/ Population Association of America (PAA)] and [http://www.eaps.nl/index.php European Association for Population Studies (EAPS)]. There is now a [http://www.isanet.org/pd/page/2/ political demography section] at the International Studies Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isanet.org/pd/page/2/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521160905/http://www.isanet.org/pd/page/2/ |archivedate=May 21, 2012 |title=The Political Demography &amp; Geography Section Charter |url-status=dead |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of important international conferences have also taken place since 2006 on the subject.&lt;ref name="sneps1"/&gt;

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}

'''Criminalization''' or '''criminalisation''', in [[criminology]], is "the process by which behaviors and individuals are transformed into [[crime]] and criminals".&lt;ref&gt;Michalowski p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously legal acts may be transformed into crimes by [[legislation]] or judicial decision. However, there is usually a formal presumption in the rules of [[statutory interpretation]] against the [[Ex post facto law|retrospective application of laws]] and only the use of express words by the legislature may rebut this presumption. The power of judges to make new law and retrospectively criminalise behaviour is also discouraged. In a less overt way, where laws have not been strictly enforced, the acts prohibited by those laws may also undergo ''de facto'' criminalization through more effective or committed legal enforcement.  The process of criminalization takes place through societal institutions including schools, the family, and the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Punished:  Policing the Lives of Black and Latino Boys|last=Rios|first=Victor M.|publisher=New York University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8147-7637-7|location=New York and London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problems==
There has been some uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the contribution to be made by the victims of crime. But, as Garkawe (2001) indicates, the relationship between [[victimology]] and [[criminology]] has become problematic. The concern is that, within the [[dialectic]] of [[Right Realism]] and [[Left realism|Left Realism]],&lt;ref&gt;Walklate (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; a focus on the victim promotes rights selectively for certain victims, and advocates the assumption that some victim rights are more important than competing rights or values in society.&lt;ref&gt;Elias (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[Islamic]] [[feminism|feminist]] might seek consistency of treatment for women as victims and, therefore, demand the decriminalization of abortion, adultery, and seduction ([[Zina]] is a [[Hudud]] offense in [[sharia|sharia law]]), and the criminalization of [[domestic violence]] and [[sexual harassment]].

In formal academically published theory, the real ruling class of a society reaches a temporary view on whether certain acts or behavior are harmful or criminal. Historically this one theory will be modified by scientific, medical evidence, by political change, and the criminal justice system may or may not treat those matters as crimes.

Conversely, when local politics determines that it is no longer a crime, they may be decriminalized. For example, Recommendation No. R (95) 12 adopted by the [[Council of Europe Committee of Ministers|Committee of Ministers]] of the Council of Europe on the management of criminal justice, advocates that crime policies such as decriminalization, depenalisation or diversion, and mediation should be adopted wherever possible. But the law and order debate between right and left politicians is often superficial and unscientific, formulating policies based on their appeal to an uniformed electorate rather than properly conducted research.&lt;ref&gt;Currie (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Several principles may underpin decisions about criminalization. These include the ''[[de minimis]]'' principle, that of the minimum criminalization.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this principle, the general harm principle fails to consider the possibility of other sanctions and the effectiveness of criminalization as a chosen option. Those other sanctions include civil courts, laws of [[tort]] and [[regulation]]. Having criminal remedies in place is seen as a "last resort" since such actions often infringe personal liberties &amp;ndash; [[incarceration]], for example, prevents the freedom of movement. In this sense, law making that places a greater emphasis on human rights. Most crimes of direct actions ([[murder]], [[rape]], [[assault]], for example) are generally not affected by such a stance, but it does require greater justification in less clear cases.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"/&gt;

The policy of "social defense" can be seen as an opposing view. It argues that criminalization is used against "any form of activity which threatens good order or is thought reprehensible". The minimization principle may unwittingly prevent the adaptation of the law to new situations.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"/&gt; In general, worldwide policy makers have created a myriad of smaller offences, in contradiction to the minimization principle and more in keeping with the [[social defence]].&lt;ref name="ashworth68"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harm===
{{see also|Victimless crimes}}
Leading criminal law philosophers, such as Dennis Baker and Joel Feinberg have argued that conduct should only be criminalized when it is fair to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate 2011) at chapter 3; Dennis J. Baker Dennis, "The Moral Limits of Criminalizing Remote Harms", (2007) 11(3) New Criminal Law Review 371, Joel Feinberg, Harm to Others: The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law, OUP, 1984: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, such theorists assert that objective reasons are needed to demonstrate that it is fair to criminalize conduct in any given case. The commonly cited objective justification for invoking the criminal law is harmful to others, but it cannot deal with all situations. For example, people are not necessarily harmed by public nudity. Feinberg suggests that offence to others also provides an objective reason for invoking the criminal law, but it clearly does not as offence is determined according to conventional morality. Prostitution is another grey area, as some countries allow it in different forms, and it is hard to say whether or not it specifically harms the public in general.  One argument may be that prostitution perpetuates the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, and therefore harms the public which partakes in the act of prostitution.  However, the legalization of prostitution would change the way it is regulated, and law enforcement could find a way to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted disease, thus eliminating the health issue and the question of the morality of the profession would be weakened.

People experience a range of physical and social injuries in different contexts which will vary according to the level of economic and political development of their country. Some will be injured out of [[poverty]] and [[malnutrition]], others by [[violence]] which might stem from a major conflict such as [[war]] or from the personal violence in a [[robbery]]. The [[natural environment|environment]] may be damaged by [[pollution]], there may be hazards at work. Many of these sources of injury will be ignored while the state may delegate powers of control to a number of different agencies within an international framework where [[supranationalism|supranational]] agencies and [[human rights]] organisations may offer assistance in responding to the causes of those injuries.

===Moral approaches and autonomy===
The extent to which behaviours considered [[morally wrong]] in a given jurisdiction should be criminalized is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 42&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; Lying or breaking promises are not in general criminalised, for example. [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]] believed that moral behaviour was essential in maintaining the cohesion of a state, and so lawmakers should be entitled to criminalise immoral behaviour.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; However, opponents of this approach typically suggest use of a harm principle only and that immorality is not a reason in itself since outcomes of such activity can be used to come to a conclusion alone. Devlin's argument uses the disgust of the general public as a definition of morality; however, issues involving [[prejudice]] have shown this to be flawed and opponents push for a much stricter definition if this approach is to be used.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"/&gt; Devlin suggested a jury to give an indication of immoral behaviour. As well as prejudice, views were likely to vary widely on issues such as [[homosexuality]], [[contraception]] and other matters, particularly those influenced by religion. Agreement would be hard to find.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"/&gt; Other opposition has been from liberal groups which favour approaches which maximise individual rights.&lt;ref name="ashworth44"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; A moral basis for criminalization would be [[paternalistic]], thereby contrasting with personal autonomy. The [[European Convention of Human Rights]], in the most part supporting individual rights from government interferences, still includes a provision for interference "for the protection of health and morals"&lt;ref name="ashworth44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm |title=Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Measures |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] |year=2010 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as legally requiring [[seat belt]]s to be worn (in some jurisdictions) are hard to justify if an individualistic approach is taken, since, if public health provision is ignored, little harm is caused to others.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 44&amp;ndash;45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Raz]] argues that the state cannot and should not enforce morality; rather, any attempt to limit individual autonomy should be done only to limit harm. Certain moral ideals may be justifiable if they extend autonomy. If the immoral conduct of others impinges on someone else's autonomy, then that can be legislated against.&lt;ref name="ashworth45"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some groups for whom the principle of autonomy is weakened: those under an [[age of majority]] and those people who are impaired by, for example, a [[mental disorder]].&lt;ref name="ashworth45"/&gt; In general, these people are protected from activities with significant consequences, if they are not in a position to make reasoned decisions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 45&amp;ndash;46.&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve the criminalization of [[under-age drinking]], [[smoking]], [[gambling]] and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]]. Such criminalization is rarely challenged.&lt;ref name="ashworth45"/&gt;

In [[British law]], a distinction between public and private acts was made in the [[Wolfenden report]], which examined sexual activities (particularly homosexuality and [[prostitution]]). Some acts would effectively become legal within private settings, but illegal in public settings.&lt;ref name="ashworth46"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The justification for this was the concept of shock or offensive to the public. Such a line was favoured by [[Joel Feinberg]], who argued that it was a good reason in support of legislation if it effectively prevented "serious offence" to persons other than the [[actor (law)|actor]].&lt;ref name="ashworth46"/&gt; Philosophers such as Feinberg struggle to quantify the ideology behind the illegality of acts which in another setting would be acceptable (that acts themselves not causing harm, for example), for example [[nudity]]. Since such acts publicly are made illegal on the basis of shock, then whether to criminalise depends on a shifting body of public opinion, which varies from place to place and from time to time. The concept of "insult" rather than "offensive" may be more specific.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 46&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omission===
{{main|Omission (criminal law)}}
[[Common law]] does not often find an actor liable for omission &amp;ndash; failing to do something required by the law. Where this has applied it has typically been in industrial [[regulation]], in matters of [[social security]] or some personal regulated activity such as driving (for example, in the case of a [[hit and run (vehicular)|hit and run]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 47&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt; These form conditions placed upon operating in a particular manner and are thus understood in that context. There are few general duties in common law jurisdictions, although these do include the responsibility of a parent to safeguard their children, to a landowner to prevent offences being carried out there, and to someone creating a dangerous situation to attempt to limit that danger.&lt;ref name="ashworth48"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of limited liability for omissions suggest that the wording for such a law would be vague, possibly involving "reasonable" care or action, and so would be hard to enforce. This would give prosecutors wide discretion, which may be opposed to justice.&lt;ref name="ashworth48"/&gt; Morally, omission is viewed by many as a far lesser problem than act; compared to murder, allowing someone to die is seen as much smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 48&amp;ndash;49.&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement to spend one's time and energy helping others would seem to contradict the autonomy many other laws aim to provide the individual with.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents point out these arguments fail to consider the harm that such omissions may cause, in contradiction to the harm principle many legal systems start out with. Life and physical integrity are often the highest priorities of a legal system.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"/&gt; Difficulties in definition are in common with many other areas, theorists such as Feinburg point out. A non-burdensome rescue is likely to be less valuable than freedom of action.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"/&gt; Limited liability is considered as article 223 of the [[French Penal Code]], which criminalises: "(1) a person who voluntarily neglects to prevent a serious crime of offense against that person, if that crime could be prevented without personal risk or risk to others; and (2) a person who voluntarily neglects to give, to a person in peril,  assistance which could be rendered without personal risk or risk to others."&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 49&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt; This is common with several other European jurisdictions. Whilst open to the criticisms of vagueness and prosecutor discretion, it has not been seen as overly oppressive.&lt;ref name="ashworth50"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedure===
When a state debates whether to respond to a source of injury by criminalising the behaviour that produces it, there are no pre-set criteria to apply in formulating social policy. There is no ontological reality to crime. The criminal justice system responds to a substantial number of events that do not produce significant hardship to individual citizens. Moreover, events which do cause serious injuries and perhaps should be dealt with as crimes, e.g. situations of [[corporate manslaughter]], are either ignored or dealt with as civil matters.

The criminalization process defines and classifies behaviour. It broadcasts the laws so that no-one may have the [[excuse]] of [[ignorantia juris non excusat|ignorance]], and disposes of those who will not obey. There are now more criminal laws and they are penetrating deeper into the social structures of modern societies. Crime control has become an industry, yet it remains ineffective in providing protection to all its citizens from harm. Such as it is, the process is made up of three components:
#Creation of a social order. This is both a socio-economic process, a "...fundamental ordering of social relations so that those things necessary for social survival can be produced and distributed in some predictable fashion" and an ideological process so that there can be a "...development of values, beliefs, and ideas related to the concrete tasks of production and distribution."(p.&amp;nbsp;6). Thus, society must develop the apparatus of law creation, law enforcement and [[punishment]] and the system must be acceptable to the majority of those who live in the community. If the laws do not match the general [[mores]], their enforcement will be a source of friction and disharmony. Conformity to the social order must, for the most part, be self-enforced.
#For the times when self-enforcement fails, society must create a legal order. This part of the process sees the centralisation of power within the institutions of the political state.  Some states justified the criminalization process as demonstrating their concerns about safety and security, the policy of control, policing, criminal justice, and penal practice. The modern state is [[decentralisation|decentralising]] and [[privatisation|privatising]] its functions. This is changing the character and content of the remaining institutions of the state which must now work co-operatively with other for-profit agencies.
#The political order must realign so that the remaining political entities such as [[legislature]]s and [[judge]]s set agreed targets for state control and then produce actual outputs of the legal order, i.e. of people defined as criminal and processed through that system.

==Ontological basis of crime==

Put in the most simple terms, ontology deals with or establishes the clear grounds for being. (Heidegger, Martin, Being and Time, introduction, referencing Plato's Parmenides.) In some of the traditional schools, such as those of the post-1688 English or Americans (many of the writings of the American Founding Fathers, but especially The Federalist) and their Dutch predecessors (see Kossmann, E. H. Political Thought in the Dutch Republic, 2004) ontology proper is deemed beyond the scope of legal thought, in accord with the modern distinction between society and state (which some consider based in the distinction the Romans made between themselves and their Italian allies, the socii, but not given the theoretical articulation we recognize today until emphasized by Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan. See [[State (polity)|state]].) However, some classical theorists, such as Aristotle, in his Politics and Metaphysics, and to a lesser degree in his Topics,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} suggest that the distinction is at least problematic. One need consider no further than the claim that man is a political animal to see this is so.

As a political animal, man has come to see himself as possessed of rights,&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Council, http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/&lt;/ref&gt; whether these are the [[Rights of Englishmen]] of old, or the universal human rights advocated vigorously toward establishment today through the matrix of commercialism.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; At least in the today dominant American model, deprivation of right amounts to injury (consider especially Justice Stevens dissenting opinion in [[Castle Rock v. Gonzales]]), and injury—so goes the prevailing theory—amounts, when coupled with requisite intent, in most cases, to crime, when it does not admit of civil redress. Thus, again in simple terms, and to the extent that human beings are indeed political beings, crime does seem to have an ontological basis. (For one approach to the question of criminal ontology, see "Understanding Crime and Social Control in Market Economies: Looking Back and Moving Forward" by Robert Bohm in Jeffrey Ian Ross, ed. Cutting the Edge: Current Perspectives in Radical/Critical Criminology and Criminal Justice. Westport, Conn: Praeger, 1998.) This, further, seems to hold if ontology itself is divided into political and trans- or supra- or meta- political ontology—i.e., what once was the realm of Christian theology. Of course, it does not matter whether that theology is Christian or belonging to some other apolitical belief. The point is that one may, with some justice, argue persuasively that being is divided. This need not, however, force the question of meta-political crimes. Our purposes here, in this article, are limited to the political. For the question in general see [[Ontology]].

Baker  argues that only objective harms and other objective bad consequences (or actions in the case of inchoate and endangerment offenses) are prima facie criminalizable. By other bad consequences Baker means privacy violations and conduct that does not necessarily result in tangible harm, but does result in unwanted consequences. Baker argues that the privacy violations that result from being forced to receive unwanted obscene information in public places (exhibitionism) would amount to a sufficient bad consequence for the purposes of invoking the criminal law,  but argues that proportionate punishment means that such conduct should only be punished with fines rather than jail terms.

[[Image:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 4 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Two men arguing politics outside Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s speech at [[Columbia University]] in 2007.]]A '''political argument''' is an instance of a [[logical argument]] applied to [[politics]]. Political arguments are used by [[academia|academics]], media [[pundit (politics)|pundits]], candidates for political office and government officials. Political arguments are also used by citizens in ordinary interactions to comment about and understand political events. More often than not, political arguments tend to be circular, repeating the same facts as premises under perhaps slightly different guises. Much political argument concerns issues of taxation and government spending.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Political argument should be distinguished from propaganda, in that propaganda has little or no structure or the rationale, if it exists, is egregiously [[fallacy|fallacious]].

A classic example of political arguments are those contained in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' arguing in favor of ratification of the [[American constitution]].

There are several ways of classifying political argument:

* Based on the purpose of the argument.
* Based on the logical structure of the argument.
* Based on the subject matter dealt with in the argument.

== Purpose of political argument ==

The purpose of argument is usually to sway belief. Political argument can occur in the context of political theory; for instance [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' can be regarded as advice to rulers based on various kinds of arguments. Political argument though is not generally a purely intellectual activity, since it may also serve the strategic goal of promoting a political agenda.  One usually thinks of political argument as exclusive to democracies, but in fact some kinds of political argument may occur in undemocratic regimes as well, for example, to encourage greater sacrifice from the population, although it is more likely in such cases that [[propaganda]] will take the place of argument.  In a [[democracy]], though, political argument is particularly important, since there is a direct relation between the beliefs of citizens and the structure of power. Moreover, the institutions of a democracy in part define the relationships between beliefs and power.  In this case, political argument is an important element of [[political strategy]]. It is also possible that in a democracy, propaganda may also replace argument; indeed, much political advertisement has no discernible logical structure, and in our definition falls under propaganda.

This view of political argument in a democracy is closely related to the problem of [[social choice]]. Consider a social decision [[model (abstract)|model]] of the kind used in the [[theory of social choice]] (such as used in stating [[Arrow's theorem]]).  In this model society has a set of individuals ''X'' and it faces a set (political) alternatives ''A'' which need to be ranked in some way.  A ''ranking'' is a [[binary relation|relation]] ''R'' between the elements of ''A'' which is [[transitive relation|transitive]] and [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]. Note that two alternatives ''a'', ''b'' can satisfy ''a R b'' and ''b R a''. If this is the case, we say ''R'' is indifferent to ''a'', ''b''.  Each individual ''x'' in ''X'' will have an idiosyncratic ranking ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of the alternatives in ''A''. A ''profile'' is any function ''P'' that associate to each individual ''x'' a ranking of alternatives ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;; a profile is thus a function from ''X'' to rankings of ''A''. An arbitration scheme (or constitution or voting scheme) is a way of producing a ranking ''R''&lt;sub&gt;soc&lt;/sub&gt; for the whole society from any profile ''P''. Thus an arbitration scheme is itself a function ''P'' → ''R''&lt;sub&gt;soc&lt;/sub&gt;.

Though any argument about politics is in a sense a political argument, an ''effective'' political argument is one that can actually change the social preference ranking. ''Effective'' political argument is a concept distinct from ''valid'' political argument.

=== Example ===
{{POV check|date=December 2008}}
Consider an idealized system of tax policy; tax is based on a tax cutoff point ''T'', that is individuals with income in excess of ''T'' pay taxes, everyone else pays no taxes.   In a simple majority rule social arbitration scheme, one might expect that a natural tax rate ''T'' can be determined: the [[median]] income (plus 1). However, a (possibly fallacious) political argument might attempt to change individual's ''voting by their pocket book'' by arguing that investment in capital and general welfare will increase by reducing taxes on higher income levels, that is raising the tax cutoff point.

A political argument may be ineffective but may still have a purpose, for instance as a justification for an unpopular political action, or as part of a historical narrative.

== Structure of political argument ==

Any argument claims to prove something. In the case of arguments used in politics, this something is an assertion about an element of the public sphere, such as economic policy, the environment, decisions about war and peace, abortion etc.   An argument cannot start from purely logical principles.  An argument is based on premises and some methods for reasoning from premises to conclusions.  The validity of an argument in politics can be evaluated in at least two ways: in purely semantic terms or in terms of adherence to certain rules of  argument (which  we can consider rules of fairness).

Semantically, one should note that some of the  premises used in an argument and the relationships between the assertions in the argument, are associated to specific models of economic or political processes. Other premises are moral assumptions: whether a particular action is good or desirable.  For example, arguments concerning  war against and must consider questions about specific threats that the adversary poses, the likelihood of success, the cost of war and so on. In practice, purely semantical evaluations of argument validity are extremely difficult to formulate in  a politically neutral way, since political positions usually involve commitment to some model of social and economic processes.

{{more citations needed|date=December 2007}}
'''Public opinion''' consists of the desires, wants and thinking of the majority of the people. It is the collective opinion of the people of a society or state on an issue or problem. 

This [[concept]] came about through the process of [[urbanization]] and other political and social forces. For the first time, it became important what people thought as forms of political contention changed.Democracy requires public opinion because it derives authority from the public.

== Etymology ==
The term public opinion was derived from the French ''opinion publique'' which was first used in 1588 by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in the second edition of his ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' (ch. XXII).&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Braatz, ''Friedrich Nietzsche: Eine Studie zur Theorie der Öffentlichen Meinung'', Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French term also appears in the 1761 work ''[[Julie, or the New Heloise]]'' by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;The term ''opinion publique'' appears in the chapter: "Lettre XXIV à Julie" of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Speier&gt;Hans Speier, "Historical Development of Public Opinion", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 55, No. 4 (Jan., 1950), pp. 376–388. {{doi|10.1086/220561}}. {{jstor|2772299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Precursors of the phrase in English include [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]]'s "general opinion" (appearing in his 1672 work ''On the Original and Nature of Government'') and [[John Locke]]'s "law of opinion" (appearing in his 1689 work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'').&lt;ref name=Speier/&gt;

== History ==
The emergence of public opinion as a significant force in the political realm can be dated to the late 17th century. However, opinion had been regarded as having singular importance since far earlier. Medieval ''fama publica'' or ''vox et fama communis'' had great legal and social importance from the 12th and 13th centuries onward.&lt;ref&gt;See {{in lang|fr}} [http://books.openedition.org/pur/15839?lang=fr Julien Théry, "''Fama'' : l'opinion publique comme preuve judiciaire. Aperçu sur la révolution médiévale de l'inquisitoire (XIIe-XIVe s.)", in B. Lemesle (ed.), ''La preuve en justice de l'Antiquité à nos jours'', Rennes, PUR, 2003, pp. 119–147, available online], and Daniel Smail, Thelma Fernster (ed), Fama. ''The Politics of Talk and Reputation'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[William Shakespeare]] called public opinion the "mistress of success" and [[Blaise Pascal]] thought it was "the queen of the world".

In his treatise ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' c, [[John Locke]] considered that man was subject to three laws: the [[divine law]], the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and most importantly in Locke's judgement, the law of [[opinion]] or [[reputation]]. He regarded the latter as of the highest importance because dislike and ''ill opinion'' force people to conform in their behaviour to social norms, however he didn't consider public opinion as a suitable influence for governments.

In his 1672 essay ''On the Original and Nature of Government'', [[Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet|William Temple]] gave an early formulation of the importance of public opinion. He observed that "when vast numbers of men submit their lives and fortunes absolutely to the will of one, it must be force of custom, or opinion which subjects power to authority". Temple disagreed with the prevalent opinion that the basis of government lay in a [[social contract]] and thought that government was merely allowed to exist due to the favour of public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historical Development of Public Opinion|last=Speier|first=Hans|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|issn=1537-5390|volume=55|issue=4|year=1950|pages=376–88|jstor=2772299 |doi=10.1086/220561|pmid=15397399|url=http://ddd.uab.cat/record/47067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prerequisites for the emergence of a public sphere were increasing levels of literacy which was spurred on by the [[Reformation]], which encouraged individuals to read the [[Bible]] in the vernacular, and the rapidly expanding printing presses. During the 18th century religious literature was replaced with secular literature, novels and pamphlets. In parallel to this was the growth in reading societies and clubs. At the turn of the century the first circulating library opened in London and the [[public library]] became widespread and available to the public.

=== Coffee-houses ===
[[File:17th century coffeehouse england 1-580x400.jpg|thumb|Coffeehouse in 17th century [[London]]]]
An institution of central importance in the development of public opinion, was the [[coffee-house]], which became widespread throughout Europe in the mid-17th century. Although [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] later tried to suppress the London coffeehouses as "places where the disaffected met, and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers", the public flocked to them. For several decades following the Restoration, the [[Wit]]s gathered round [[John Dryden]] at [[Will's Coffee House]] in Russell Street, Covent Garden.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gk8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met%2C%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;pg=PA531#v=onepage&amp;q=%22places%20where%20the%20disaffected%20met,%20and%20spread%20scandalous%20reports%20concerning%20the%20conduct%20of%20His%20Majesty%20and%20his%20Ministers%22&amp;f=false An historical and chronological deduction of the origin of commerce, from the earliest accounts. : Containing an history of the great commercial interests of the British Empire. To which is prefixed an introduction, exhibiting a view of the ancient and modern state of Europe ; of the importance of our colonies ; and of the commerce, shipping, manufactures, fisheries, &amp;c., of Great-Britain and Ireland ; and their influence on the landed interest.

Author:	Adam Anderson; William Combe; John Walter; Logographic Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee houses were great social levellers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism.

More generally, coffee houses became meeting places where business could be carried on, news exchanged and ''[[The London Gazette]]'' (government announcements) read. [[Lloyd's of London]] had its origins in a coffeehouse run by [[Edward Lloyd (coffeehouse owner)|Edward Lloyd]], where underwriters of ship insurance met to do business. By 1739, there were 551 coffeehouses in London. Each attracted a particular clientele divided by occupation or attitude, such as [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]], wits and [[stockjobber]]s, merchants and lawyers, booksellers and authors, men of fashion or the "cits" of the [[City of London|old city center]]. [[Joseph Addison]] wanted to have it said of him that he had "brought philosophy out of closets and libraries to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea tables and in coffee houses". According to one French visitor, [[Antoine François Prévost]], coffeehouses, "where you have the right to read all the papers for and against the government", were the "seats of English liberty".&lt;ref&gt;Prévost, Abbé (1930) ''Adventures of a man of quality'' (translation of ''Séjour en Angleterre'', v. 5 of ''Mémoires et avantures d'un homme de qualité qui s'est retiré du monde'') G. Routledge &amp; Sons, London, {{OCLC|396693}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gentleman clubs ===
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]], c. 1730]]
[[Gentlemen's club]]s proliferated in the 18th century, especially in the [[West End of London]]. Clubs took over the role occupied by coffee houses in 18th century London to some degree and reached the height of their influence in the late 19th century. Some notable names were [[White's]], [[Brooks's]], [[Arthur's]] and [[Boodle's]] which still exist today.

These social changes, in which a closed and largely illiterate public became an open and politicized one, was to become of tremendous political importance in the 19th century as the mass media was circulated ever more widely and literacy was steadily improved. Governments increasingly recognized the importance of [[propaganda|managing and directing public opinion]]. This trend is exemplified in the career of [[George Canning]] who restyled his political career from its aristocratic origins to one of popular consent when he contested and won the parliamentary seat in [[Liverpool]], a city with a growing and affluent middle class which he attributed to the growing influence of "public opinion".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Lee, "George Canning and Liberal Toryism, 1801–1827" Woodbridge: Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeremy Bentham]] was an impassioned advocate of the importance of public opinion in the shaping of constitutional governance. He thought it important that all government acts and decisions should be subject to the inspection of public opinion, because "to the pernicious exercise of the power of government it is the only check".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482436/public-opinion/258764/Public-opinion-and-government|title=public opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opined that public opinion had the power to ensure that rulers would rule for the greatest happiness of the greater number. He brought in [[Utilitarianism|Utilitarian philosophy]] in order to define theories of public opinion.

== Concepts ==
The German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], by using the conceptional tools of his theory of [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]], argued (''Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung'', 1922), that 'public opinion' has the equivalent [[social function]] in societies (''Gesellschaften'') which [[religion]] has in communities (''Gemeinschaften'').&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Fechner/[[Lars Clausen]]/Arno Bammé (eds.): ''Öffentliche Meinung zwischen neuer Religion und neuer Wissenschaft. Ferdinand Tönnies' "Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung" in der internationalen Diskussion'', in: ''Tönnies im Gespräch'', tom. 3, Munich/Vienna: Profil 2005, {{ISBN|3-89019-590-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

German social theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] contributed the idea of [[public sphere]] to the discussion of public opinion. According to Habermas, the public sphere, or bourgeois public, is where "something approaching public opinion can be formed" (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;351). Habermas claimed that the Public Sphere featured universal access, rational debate, and disregard for rank. However, he believes that these three features for how public opinion are best formed are no longer in place in western [[Liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] countries. Public opinion, in western democracy, is highly susceptible to elite manipulation.

The American sociologist [[Herbert Blumer]] has proposed an altogether different conception of the "public". According to Blumer, public opinion is discussed as a form of [[collective behavior]] (another specialized term) which is made up of those who are discussing a given public issue at any one time. Given this definition, there are many publics; each of them comes into being when an issue arises and ceases to exist when the issue is resolved. Blumer claims that people participate in public in different capacities and to different degrees. So, public opinion polling cannot measure the public. An educated individual's participation is more important than that of a drunk. The "mass" in which people independently make decisions about, for example, which brand of toothpaste to buy, is a form of collective behavior different from the public.

Public opinion plays an important role in the political sphere. Cutting across all aspects of relationship between government and public opinion are studies of voting behavior. These have registered the distribution of opinions on a wide variety of issues, have explored the impact of special interest groups on election outcomes and have contributed to our knowledge about the effects of government propaganda and policy.

Contemporary, quantitative approaches to the study of public opinion may be divided into four categories:
# Quantitative measurement of opinion distributions.
# Investigation of the internal relationships among the individual opinions that make up public opinion on an issue.
# Description or analysis of the public role of public opinion.
# Study both of the communication media that disseminate the ideas on which opinions are based and of the uses that propagandists and other manipulators make of these media.

The rapid spread of public opinion measurement around the world is reflection of the number of uses to which it can be put. Public opinion can be accurately obtained through [[survey sampling]]. Both private firms and governments use [[opinion poll|surveys]] to inform public policies and public relations.

== Formation ==
Numerous theories and substantial evidence exists to explain the formation and dynamics of individuals' opinions. Much of this research draws on psychological research on [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]]. In [[communications studies]] and [[political science]], [[mass media]] are often seen as influential forces on public opinion. Additionally, [[political socialization]] and [[behavioral genetics]] sometimes explain public opinion.

=== Mass media effects ===
{{see also|Media manipulation|Propaganda through media}}
The formation of public opinion starts with [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda setting]] by major media outlets throughout the world. This agenda setting dictates what is newsworthy and how and when it will be reported. The media agenda is set by a variety of different environmental and newswork factors that determines which stories will be newsworthy.

Another key component in the formation of public opinion is [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]]. Framing is when a story or piece of news is portrayed in a particular way and is meant to sway the consumers attitude one way or the other. Most political issues are heavily framed in order to persuade voters to vote for a particular candidate. For example, if Candidate X once voted on a bill that raised income taxes on the middle class, a framing headline would read "Candidate X Doesn't Care About the Middle Class". This puts Candidate X in a negative frame to the news reader.

[[Social desirability]] is another key component to the formation of public opinion. Social desirability is the idea that people in general will form their opinions based on what they believe is the prevalent opinion of the social group they identify with. Based on media agenda setting and media framing, most often a particular opinion gets repeated throughout various news mediums and [[social network]]ing sites, until it creates a false vision where the perceived truth can actually be very far away from the actual truth. When asked for their opinion on a subject about which they are uninformed, people often provide [[pseudo-opinion]]s they believe will please the questioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kivitv.com/-/the-bomb-agrabah-survey-shows-how-problematic-polling-can-be |title=The 'Bomb Agrabah' Survey Shows How Problematic Polling Can Be |last=Daniels |first=Eugene |date=December 18, 2015 |website=[[KIVI-TV]] |publisher= |access-date= July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public opinion can be influenced by [[public relations]] and the [[political media]]. Additionally, [[mass media]] utilizes a wide variety of [[advertising]] techniques to get their message out and change the minds of people. Since the 1950s, [[television]] has been the main [[mass media|medium]] for molding public opinion.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p53"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p.48&lt;/ref&gt;. Since the late 2000s, the Internet has become a platform for forming public opinion. Surveys have showed that more people get their news from [[social media]] and news websites as opposed to print newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shearer |first1=Elisa |title=Social media outpaces print newspapers in the U.S. as a news source |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/12/10/social-media-outpaces-print-newspapers-in-the-u-s-as-a-news-source/ |website=Pew Research Centre |accessdate=1 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The accessibility of social media allows public opinion to be formed by a broader range of [[social movements]] and news sources. [[:nb:Gunn Enli|Gunn Enli]] identifies the Internet’s effect on public opinion as being “characterised by an intensified personalisation of political advocacy and increased anti-elitism, popularisation and populism”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Enli |first1=Gunn |title=Twitter as arena for the authentic outsider: exploring the social media campaigns of Trump and Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election |journal=European Journal of Communication |date=2017 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=50-61 |doi=10.1177/0267323116682802 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0267323116682802 |accessdate=12/12/2019 |ref=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0267323116682802}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Public opinion has become more varied as a result of online news sources being influenced by [[political communication]] and agenda setting.

== Role of influentials ==
{{see also|Two-step flow of communication}}
There have been a variety of academic studies investigating whether or not public opinion is influenced by "[[Social influence|influentials]]", or persons that have a significant effect on influencing opinion of the general public regarding any relevant issues.  Many early studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elihu Katz and Paul Felix Lazarsfeld|title=Personal Influence: the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications|year=1955|isbn=978-1-4128-0507-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazarsfeld et al., 1968&lt;/ref&gt; have modeled the transfer of information from [[mass media]] sources to the general public as a "two-step" process. In this process, information from mass media and other far-reaching sources of information influences influentials, and influentials then influence the general public as opposed to the mass media directly influencing the public.

While the "two-step" process regarding public opinion influence has motivated further research on the role of influential persons, a more recent study by Watts and Dodds (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watts, D.J. and P.S. Dodds|year=2007|title=Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=34|issue=4|pages=441–458|url=https://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/research/papers/others/2007/watts2007a.pdf|doi=10.1086/518527}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that while influentials play some role in influencing public opinion, "non-influential" persons that make up the general public are also just as likely (if not more likely) to influence opinion provided that the general public is composed of persons that are easily influenced. This is referred to in their work as the "Influential Hypothesis". The authors discuss such results by using a model to quantify the number of people influenced by both the general public and influentials. The model can be easily customized to represent a variety of ways that influencers interact with each other as well as the general public.  In their study, such a model diverges from the prior paradigm of the "two-step" process. The Watts and Dodds model introduces a model of influence emphasizing lateral channels of influence between the influencers and general public categories. Thus, this leads to a more complex flow of influence amongst the three parties involved in influencing public opinion (i.e. media, influencers and general public).

== Relationship with public policy ==
The most pervasive issue dividing theories of the opinion-policy relation bears a striking resemblance to the problem of [[monism]]-[[pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] in the history of philosophy. The controversy deals with the question of whether the structure of [[socio-political]] action should be viewed as a more or less centralized process of acts and decisions by a class of key leaders, representing integrated hierarchies of influence in society or whether it is more accurately envisaged as several sets of relatively autonomous opinion and influence groups, interacting with representative [[decision maker]]s in an official structure of differentiated [[governmental authority]]. The former assumption interprets individual, group and official action as part of a single system and reduces politics and governmental policies to a derivative of three basic analytical terms: society, culture and [[personality]].

Despite philosophical arguments regarding public opinion, social scientists (those in [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[economics]] and [[social psychology]]) present compelling theories to describe how public opinion shapes public policy and find myriad effects of opinion on policy using various empirical research methods. Moreover, researchers find that causal relationships likely run in both directions from opinion to policy and from policy to opinion. On the one hand, public opinion signals public preferences and potential voting behaviors to policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Coping with Permanent Austerity: Welfare State Restructuring in Affluent Democracies|journal=Revue Française de Sociologie|date=2002|volume=43|issue=2|pages=369–406|jstor=3322510|doi=10.2307/3322510|citeseerx=10.1.1.716.5464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soroka|first1=Stuart|last2=Wlezien|first2=Christopher|title=Degrees of Democracy: Politics, Public Opinion and Policy|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This impact should be greater under more stable democratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Papadakis|first1=Elim|title=Public Opinion, Public Policy and the Welfare State|journal=Political Studies|date=1992|volume=40|issue=1|pages=21–37|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1992.tb01758.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be greatest in the realm of social policy because the public are highly motivated by potential goods and services they get from the state. On the other hand, social policy impacts public opinion. The goods and services the public gets via social policy builds normative expectations that shape public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mau|first1=Steffen|title=Welfare Regimes and the Norms of Social Exchange|journal=Current Sociology|date=2004|volume=52|issue=1|pages=53–74|doi=10.1177/0011392104039314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Oorschot|first1=Wim|title=Culture and Social Policy: A Developing Field of Study|journal=International Journal of Social Welfare|date=2007|volume=16|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2397.2006.00451.x|url=https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/915249/Culture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, social policy constitutes the largest share of state spending budgets, making it an active and contentious political area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Expenditures Database|url=https://www.oecd.org/social/expenditure.htm|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these theories suggest that causal effects are part of a feedback loop between opinion and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Andrea Louise|title=Policy Makes Mass Politics|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=333–351|doi=10.1146/annurev-polisci-012610-135202|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5f765cdef1be60e5662cfaebadc2d9bab7e064a8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|last2=Soroka|first2=Stuart|title=Relationships between Public Opinion and Policy|journal=Oxford Handbook of Political Behavior|date=2007|pages=799–817|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199270125-e-043?mediaType=Article|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199270125.001.0001|isbn=9780199270125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|date=2011|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using increasingly sophisticated methods, scholars are beginning to grasp and identify the feedback of opinion and policy and use this phenomenon to explain the path dependency of institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Breznau|first1=Nate|title=Positive Returns and Equilibrium: Simultaneous Feedback Between Public Opinion and Social Policy|journal=Policy Studies Journal|volume=45|issue=4|pages=583–612|date=14 July 2016|doi=10.1111/psj.12171|url=http://osf.io/wt376/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wlezien|first1=Christopher|title=The Public as Thermostat: Dynamics of Preferences for Spending|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1995|volume=39|issue=4|pages=981–1000|jstor=2111666|doi=10.2307/2111666}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pierson|first1=Paul|title=Increasing Returns, Path Dependence, and the Study of Politics|journal=The American Political Science Review|date=2000|volume=94|issue=2|pages=251–267|jstor=2586011|doi=10.2307/2586011|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/274439eda2c6c9e513794e1ee8f8eb9ac952431c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with foreign policy ==
As with public policy, public opinion also has a close relationship with [[foreign policy]]. There is much debate concerning what the relationship is and the study of foreign policy's relationship with public opinion has evolved over time, with the [[Almond–Lippmann consensus]] being one of the first attempt to define this relationship. Published before the [[Vietnam War]], [[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Walter Lippmann]] argued that public opinion about foreign policy was unstructured, incoherent, and highly volatile, and that public opinion shouldn't influence foreign policy.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Holsti, Ole R. "Public Opinion and Foreign Policy: Challenges to the Almond-Lippmann Consensus Mershon Series: Research Programs and Debates." International Studies Quarterly, vol. 36, no. 4, 1992, pp. 439–466. {{jstor|2600734}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have rebuked the Almond-Lippmann Consensus, showing how people's opinions are generally stable, and that while individuals may not be entirely informed about every issue, they still act efficiently and rationally.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew A. Baum and Philip B. K. Potter, "The Relationships Between Mass Media, Public Opinion, and Foreign Policy: Toward a Theoretical Synthesis," ''Annual Review of Political Science'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

People’s judgments about issues are often based on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that allow rational decisions to be made quickly. [[Heuristics]] apply to public opinion about domestic as well as foreign policy. The deductive heuristic is one that relies on a person's core values and social groups. Delegative heuristics are influenced by figures of authority such as the media or president.&lt;ref&gt;Sniderman, Paul. Reasoning and Choice. ''Explorations in Political Psychology''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key theory about how people form their opinions on foreign policy issues is Jon Hurwitz and Mark Peffley's hierarchical attitudes model. They argue that it is structured, with core values providing the basis for postures which further influence the ultimate issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz, Jon, and Mark Peffley. "How Are Foreign Policy Attitudes Structured? A Hierarchical Model." The American Political Science Review, vol. 81, no. 4, 1987, pp. 1099–1120. {{jstor|1962580}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion about foreign policy is measured in the same way that all public opinion is measured. Through [[Opinion poll|polls]] and surveys, respondents are asked about their issue positions. Conclusions are drawn by researchers by applying the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/methods-101-random-sampling/ pewresearch.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship with U.S. Presidency ==
According to Robert Shapiro, public opinion and policy-making are fundamental to a democracy, which is linked to electoral accountability, meaning that the leader who was elected "will not deviate far from voters’ opinion".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; A problem that arises when analyzing the data collected by researchers is how these issues that are "important" are selected when collecting the data about public opinion. It is hard to determine if there has been underdevelopment of certain issues. Another concern is how elites influence public opinion by persuasion and rhetoric, ultimately shaping policy-making. These two variables are ambiguous by nature and are hard to get to any conclusions, in most cases beyond the limits of research. Other variables to look at when analyzing the opinion-policy effect are the size of the majority public, election cycle time, degree of electoral competition, and the type of issue. For example, domestic affairs public opinion will be of greater importance than that of foreign affairs because of the complexity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shapiro|first1=Robert|date=2011|title=Public Opinion and American Democracy|url=https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/75/5/982/1826441|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=75|issue=5|pages=982–1017|doi=10.1093/poq/nfr053|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since presidents have the ability to influence their political agenda, it is easier for them to respond to public opinion. Since they are not an institution (like Congress), they can also "shift the standards by which the public evaluates their performance in office – away from policy concerns and towards more symbolic activities, image, and personality".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study by James N. Druckman and [[Lawrence R. Jacobs]] discusses how presidents collect their information for policymaking. They found that on one hand, they collect data about the public's preference on salient matters like crime and economy. This reflects a populist type of democracy where the government portrays respect toward the people's views and they are connected. On the other hand, government institutions and elites believe the general populations’ understanding of certain issued is limited, therefore they exercise autonomy when making these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Druckman|first1=J.N.|date=2009|title=Presidential Responsiveness to public opinion|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199238859-e-8|journal=The Oxford Handbook of American Presidency|volume=|page=454|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199238859.003.0008|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Baum and Kernell have stated that a challenge that modern presidents face when trying to persuade public opinion is that there is so many different types of media, that getting people's attention is hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baum and Kernell|first1=M.A., S|title=Has Cable Ended the Golden Age of Presidential Television?|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=93|issue=1|pages=99–114|doi=10.2307/2585763|jstor=2585763|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media alternatives has also caused on effect on Presidential leadership as they now use them to be able to communicate younger generations, but targeting small groups of people.

'''Political philosophy''', or '''political theory''', is the study of topics such as [[politics]], [[liberty]], [[justice]], [[property]], [[rights]], [[law]], and the enforcement of a laws by [[authority]]: what they are, why (or even if) they are needed, what, if anything, makes a [[The purpose of government|government legitimate]], what rights and freedoms it should protect and why, what form it should take and why, what the law is, and what duties citizens owe to a legitimate government, if any, and when it may be legitimately overthrown, if ever.

In a [[vernacular]] sense, the term "political philosophy" often refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics, synonymous to the term "[[political ideology]]".

==Definitions and measurements==

According to DiMaggio et al. (1996), "Polarization is both a state and a process. Polarization as a state refers to the extent to which opinions on an issue are opposed in relation to some theoretical maximum. Polarization as a process refers to the increase in such opposition over time."&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt; Polarization can be benign, natural, and democratizing, or it can be pernicious, having longterm malignant effects on society and congesting essential democratic functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/99/de/99dedd73-f8bc-484c-8b91-44ba601b6e6b/v-dem_democracy_report_2019.pdf|title=Varieties of Democracy Report 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some political scientists argue that polarization requires divergence on a broad range of issues,&lt;ref name=dimaggio-96/&gt;&lt;ref name=fiorina-08/&gt; while others argue that only a few issues are required.&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=bafumi-09/&gt;

Political scientists typically distinguish between two levels of political polarization: elite and mass. "Elite polarization" focuses on the polarization of the political elites, like [[party organizer]]s and [[elected officials]]. "Mass polarization" (or popular polarization) focuses on the polarization of the masses, most often the electorate or general public.&lt;ref name="mccarty-06"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/polarizedamerica0037mcca/page/|title=Polarized America : the dance of ideology and unequal riches|last=McCarty|first=Nolan|author2=Poole, Keith T.|author3=Rosenthal, Howard|publisher=MIT Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0262134644|at=[https://archive.org/details/polarizedamerica0037mcca/page/ Cambridge, Mass.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Marc J.|title=Review Article: Putting Polarization in Perspective|journal=British Journal of Political Science|date=17 February 2009|volume=39|issue=2|page=413|doi=10.1017/S0007123408000501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06&gt;{{cite journal|last=Layman|first=Geoffrey C.|author2=Carsey, Thomas M. |author3=Horowitz, Juliana Menasce |title=Party Polarization in American Politics: Characteristics, Causes, and Consequences|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=1 June 2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=83–110|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.9.070204.105138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmines|first=E.

===Elite polarization===

[[File:NOMINATE polarization.jpg|thumb|Political polarization in the United States House of Representatives (DW-Nominate scores)]]
Elite polarization refers to polarization between the party-in-government and the party-in-opposition.&lt;ref name=baldassarri-08/&gt; Polarized political parties are internally cohesive, unified, programmatic, and ideologically distinct; they are typically found in a [[parliamentary system]] of democratic governance.&lt;ref name="mann-12"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQORs1_S2sgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=It's Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American constitutional system collided with the new politics of extremism|last=Mann|first=Thomas E.|author2=Ornstein, Norman J.|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0465031337|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705154533/http://books.google.com/books?id=CQORs1_S2sgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=2014-07-05|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;

In a [[two-party system]], a polarized [[legislature]] has two important characteristics: first, there is little-to-no ideological overlap between members of the two parties; and second, almost all conflict over legislation and policies is split across a broad ideological divide. This leads to a conflation of political parties and ideologies (i.e., Democrat and Republican become nearly perfect synonyms for liberal and conservative) and the collapse of an ideological center.&lt;ref name="mann-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carmines-12" /&gt;

The vast majority of studies on elite polarization focus on legislative and deliberative bodies. For many years, political scientists measured polarization in the US by examining the ratings of party members published by interest groups, but now, most analyze [[recorded vote|roll-call voting]] patterns to investigate trends in party-line voting and party unity.&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty-06" /&gt; Gentzkow, Shapiro, and Taddy used the text of the Congressional Record to document differences in speech patterns between Republicans and Democrats as a measure of polarization, finding a dramatic increase in polarized speech patterns starting in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Gentzkow, Matthew, and Shapiro, Jesse, and Taddy, Matt [http://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/politext.pdf Measuring Polarization in High-Dimensional Data: Method and Application to Congressional Speech]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass polarization===

Mass polarization, or popular polarization, occurs when an electorate's attitudes towards political issues, policies, and celebrated figures are neatly divided along party lines.&lt;ref name=mccarty-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=carmines-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=claassen-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Claassen|first=R.L.|author2=Highton, B.|title=Policy Polarization among Party Elites and the Significance of Political Awareness in the Mass Public|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=9 September 2008|volume=62|issue=3|pages=538–551|doi=10.1177/1065912908322415}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the extreme, each camp questions the moral legitimacy of the other, viewing the opposing camp and its policies as an existential threat to their way of life or the nation as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.people-press.org/2016/06/22/partisanship-and-political-animosity-in-2016/|title=Partisanship and Political Animosity in 2016|last=NW|first=1615 L.

Many political scientists consider political polarization a top-down process, in which elite polarization leads to – or at least precedes – popular polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Benkler |first1=Yochai |year=2018 |url=https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190923624.001.0001/oso-9780190923624-chapter-10 |title=Network Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics |publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online |publication-date=2018-10-01 |doi=10.1093/oso/9780190923624.003.0010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, polarization among elites does not necessarily produce polarization within the electorate, and polarized electoral choices can often reflect elite polarization rather than voters' preferences.&lt;ref name="fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mccarty-06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hetherington-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="carmines-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="claassen-08" /&gt;

Political scientists who study mass polarization typically rely on data from [[opinion polls]] and election surveys. They look for trends in respondents' opinions on a given issue, their voting history, and their political ideology (conservative, liberal, moderate, etc.), and they try to relate those trends to respondents' party identification and other potentially polarizing factors (like geographic location or income bracket).&lt;ref name="dimaggio-96" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hetherington-09" /&gt; Political scientists typically limit their inquiry to issues and questions that have been constant over time, in order to compare the present day to what the political climate has historically been.&lt;ref name="claassen-08" /&gt;

=== Pernicious polarization ===
In political science, pernicious polarization occurs when a single [[Cleavage (politics)|political cleavage]] overrides other divides and commonalities to the point it has boiled into a single divide which becomes entrenched and self-reinforcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Jennifer|last2=Rahman|first2=Tahmina|date=2016-07-25|title=Polarized Democracies in Comparative Perspective: Toward a Conceptual Framework|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336830321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most types of polarization, pernicious polarization does not need to be [[Ideological continuum|ideological]]. Rather, pernicious polarization operates on a single political cleavage, which can be [[Political party|partisan identity]], [[Religion|religious]] vs [[Secularism|secular]], [[Globalism|globalist]] vs [[Nationalism|nationalist]], [[Urban area|urban]] vs [[Rural area|rural]], etc.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Jennifer|last2=Somer|first2=Murat|date=2019-01-01|title=Toward a Theory of Pernicious Polarization and How It Harms Democracies: Comparative Evidence and Possible Remedies|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|language=en|volume=681|issue=1|pages=234–271|doi=10.1177/0002716218818782|issn=0002-7162}}&lt;/ref&gt; This political divide creates an explosion of mutual group [[distrust]] which hardens between the two political parties (or [[Coalitions of parties|coalitions]]) and spreads beyond the political sphere into societal relations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; People begin to perceive politics as "us" vs "them."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Somer|first=Murat|last2=McCoy|first2=Jennifer|date=2019-01-01|title=Transformations through Polarizations and Global Threats to Democracy|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=681|issue=1|pages=8–22|doi=10.1177/0002716218818058|issn=0002-7162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Causes ====
According to Carothers &amp; O'Donohue (2019), pernicious polarization is a process most often driven by a single political cleavage dominating an otherwise pluralistic political life, overriding other cleavages.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/book/democracies-divided/|title=Democracies Divided|last=and|date=2019-04-01|website=Brookings|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Slater &amp; Arugay (2019) have argued that it's not the depth of a single social cleavage, but the political elite's process for removing a leader which best explains whether or not polarization truly becomes pernicious.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Polarizing Figures: Executive Power and Institutional Conflict in Asian Democracies|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=62|pages=92–106|last=Arugay, Slater|first=Aires, Dan|date=2019|doi=10.1177/0002764218759577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebas &amp; Munemo (2019) have argued pernicious polarization is marked by both deeper societal penetration and segregation than other forms of political polarization, making it less amenable to resolution.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeBas|first=Adrienne|last2=Munemo|first2=Ngonidzashe|date=2019-01-01|title=Elite Conflict, Compromise, and Enduring Authoritarianism: Polarization in Zimbabwe, 1980–2008|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|language=en|volume=681|issue=1|pages=209–226|doi=10.1177/0002716218813897|issn=0002-7162}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is agreed, however, that pernicious polarization reinforces and entrenches itself, dragging the country into a downward spiral of anger and division for which there are no easy remedies.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Effect on governance ====
Pernicious polarization makes [[compromise]], [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]], interaction, and [[Toleration|tolerance]] increasingly costly and tenuous for individuals and political actors on both sides of the divide.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Somer, McCoy|first=Murat, Jennifer|date=2018|title=Deja Vu? Polarization and Endangered Democracies in the 21st Century|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1177/0002764218760371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pernicious polarization routinely weakens respect for democratic norms, corrodes basic [[Legislature|legislative]] processes, undermines the nonpartisan nature of the [[judiciary]] and fuels public disaffection with political parties. It exacerbates intolerance and [[discrimination]], diminishes societal [[Trust (social science)|trust]], and increases [[violence]] throughout the society.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In country-by-country instances of pernicious polarization, it is common to see the winner exclude the loser from positions of power or using means to prevent the loser from becoming a threat in the future. In these situations, the loser typically questions the legitimacy of the institutions allowing the winner to create a [[hegemony]], which causes citizens to grow [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]] towards politics. In these countries, politics is often seen as a self-referential power game that has nothing to do with people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vegetti|first=Federico|date=2019-01-01|title=The Political Nature of Ideological Polarization: The Case of Hungary|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|language=en|volume=681|issue=1|pages=78–96|doi=10.1177/0002716218813895|issn=0002-7162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effect on public trust ====
Perniciously polarized societies often witness public [[Controversy|controversies]] over factually provable questions. During this process, [[fact]]s and moral truths increasingly lose their weight, as more people [[Conformity|conform]] to the messages of their own bloc. Social and political actors such as [[journalist]]s, [[academics]], and [[politician]]s either become engaged in [[Partisan (politics)|partisan]] storytelling or else incur growing [[social]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Economics|economic]] costs. Electorates lose confidence in [[Public institution (United States)|public institutions]]. Support for norms and [[democracy]] decline. It becomes increasingly difficult for people to act in a [[Morality|morally principled]] fashion by appealing to the [[truth]] or acting in line with one's [[Value (ethics)|values]] when it conflicts with one's party interests.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Once pernicious polarization takes hold, it takes on a life of its own, regardless of earlier [[intention]]s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Benign polarization ===
Several political scientists have argued that most types of political polarization are beneficial to democracy, as well as a natural feature. The simplifying features of polarization can help [[democratization]]. Strategies which depend on [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] and [[Social exclusion|exclusion]] are present in all forms of observed politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/catalog/bib_5918589|title=The semisovereign people: a realist's view of democracy in America|last=Schattschneider|first=E.

Political polarization can serve to unify, invigorate, or mobilize potential [[Alliance|allies]] at the elite and mass levels. It can also help to divide, weaken, or pacify competitors. Even the most celebrated [[social movement]]s can be described as a "group of people involved in a conflict with clearly defined opponents having a conflictual orientation toward an opponent and a common identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.oxfordpoliticstrove.com/view/10.1093/hepl/9780198737421.001.0001/hepl-9780198737421-chapter-16|title=16.

Political polarization can also provide voting [[heuristic]]s to help voters choose among [[candidate]]s, enabling political parties to mobilize supporters and provide programmatic choices.&lt;ref name="Polarized"/&gt; Polarizing politics can also help to overcome internal differences and frame a common identity, based in part on a common opposition to those resisting [[reform]]s. Still, polarization can be a risky political tool even when intended as an instrument of democratization, as it risks turning pernicious and self-propagating.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Causes==
There are various causes of political polarization and these include political parties, [[redistricting]], the public's [[political ideologies|political ideology]], and the mass media.

===Party polarization===
Some scholars argue that diverging parties has been one of the major driving forces of polarization as policy platforms have become more distant. This theory is based on recent trends in the [[United States Congress]], where the [[majority party]] prioritizes the positions that are most aligned with its [[party platform]] and political ideology.&lt;ref name=ura-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ura|first=Joseph Daniel|author2=Ellis, Christopher R.|title=Partisan Moods: Polarization and the Dynamics of Mass Party Preferences|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=10 February 2012|volume=74|issue=1|pages=277–291|doi=10.1017/S0022381611001587|hdl=1969.1/178724}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of more ideologically distinct positions by political parties can cause polarization among both elites and the electorate. For example, after the passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]], the number of conservative Democrats in Congress decreased, while the number of conservative Republicans increased. Within the electorate during the 1970s, [[Southern Democrats]] shifted toward the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], showing polarization among both the elites and the electorate of both main parties.&lt;ref name=mann-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=abramowitz-98&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz|first=Alan I.|author2=Saunders, Kyle L.|title=Ideological Realignment in the U.S. Electorate|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=August 1998|volume=60|issue=3|page=634|doi=10.2307/2647642|jstor=2647642}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=galston-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galston|first=William A.|title=Political Polarization and the U.S. Judiciary|journal=UKMC Law Review|year=2009|volume=77|issue=207|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/umkc77&amp;div=15&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists have shown politicians have an incentive to advance and support polarized positions.&lt;ref name=beniers-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beniers|first=Klaas J.|author2=Dur, Robert|title=Politicians' motivation, political culture, and electoral competition|journal=International Tax and Public Finance|date=1 February 2007|volume=14|issue=1|pages=29–54|doi=10.1007/s10797-006-8878-y|url=https://papers.tinbergen.nl/04065.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These argue that during the early 1990s, the Republican Party used polarizing tactics to become the majority party in the [[United States House of Representatives]]—which political scientists [[Thomas E. Mann]] and [[Norman Ornstein]] refer to as [[Newt Gingrich]]'s "guerrilla war."&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt; What political scientists have found is that moderates are less likely to run than are candidates who are in line with party doctrine, otherwise known as "party fit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomsen|first1=Danielle M.|title=Ideological Moderates Won't Run: How Party Fit Matters for Partisan Polarization in Congress|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=2014|volume=76|issue=3|pages=786–797|doi=10.1017/s0022381614000243|jstor=0022381614000243|hdl=10161/8931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories state politicians who cater to more extreme groups within their party tend to be more successful, helping them stay in office while simultaneously pulling their constituency toward a polar extreme.&lt;ref name=hirano-09&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirano|first=Shigeo, Jr. |author2=James M.

As a result, political leaders may be more likely to take polarized stances.&lt;ref name=nicholson-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=Stephen P.|title=Polarizing Cues|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=1 January 2012|volume=56|issue=1|pages=52–66|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00541.x|pmid=22400143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to [[multiparty systems]], [[Giovanni Sartori]] (1966, 1976) claims the splitting of ideologies in the public constituency causes further divides within the political parties of the countries. He theorizes that the extremism of public ideological movement is the basis for the creation of highly polarized multiparty systems. Sartori named this polarizing phenomenon [[polarized pluralism]] and claimed it would lead to further polarization in many opposing directions (as opposed to in simply two directions, as in a polarized two-party system) over policy issues.&lt;ref name=sartori-66&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sartori|first=Giovanni|title=European political parties: the case of polarized pluralism|journal=Political Parties and Political Development|pages=137–176|year=1966|doi=10.1515/9781400875337-006|isbn=9781400875337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sartori-76&gt;{{cite book|last=Sartori|first=Giovanni|title=Parties and party systems : a framework for analysis|year=1976|publisher=ECPR|location=Colchester|isbn=978-0954796617|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywr0CcGDNHwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=[Nouvelle édition]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnston-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Richard|title=Polarized Pluralism in the Canadian Party System: Presidential Address to the Canadian Political Science Association, June 5, 2008|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science|date=17 December 2008|volume=41|issue=4|page=815|doi=10.1017/S0008423908081110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polarization in multiparty systems can also be defined along two ideological extremes, like in the case of [[India]] in the 1970s. Ideological splits within a number of India's major parties resulted in two polarized coalitions on the right and left, each consisting of multiple political parties.&lt;ref name=davey-72&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davey|first=Hampton|title=Polarization and Consensus in Indian Party Politics|journal=Asian Survey|date=1 August 1972|volume=12|issue=8|pages=701–716|doi=10.2307/2643110|jstor=2643110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political fund-raisers and donors can also exert significant influence and control over legislators. Party leaders are expected to be productive fund-raisers, in order to support the party's campaigns. After ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'', special interests in the U.S. were able to greatly impact elections through increased undisclosed spending, notably through [[Super PACs|Super political action committees]]. Some, such as ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' opinion writer [[Robert G. Kaiser|Robert Kaiser]], argued this allowed wealthy people, corporations, unions, and other groups to push the parties' policy platforms toward ideological extremes, resulting in a state of greater polarization.&lt;ref name=mann-12 /&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiser-10&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaiser|first=Robert G.|title=So damn much money : the triumph of lobbying and the corrosion of American government|year=2010|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0307385888|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJxU1MzQZVoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Raymond J. La Raja and David L. Wiltse, note that this does not necessarily hold true for mass donors to political campaigns.

===The public===
In democracies and other [[Representative democracy|representative governments]], citizens vote for the political actors who will represent them. Some scholars argue that political polarization reflects the public's ideology and voting preferences.&lt;ref name=galston-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=garner-10&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garner | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Palmer | first2 = Harvey | title = Polarization and issue consistency over time | journal = [[Political Behavior (journal)|Political Behavior]] | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 225–246 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s11109-010-9136-7 | date = June 2011 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mason-12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mason|first=Lilliana |title=The rise of uncivil agreement: issue versus behavioral polarization in the American electorate|journal=[[American Behavioral Scientist]]|date=January 2013|volume=57|issue=1|pages=140–159 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] |doi= 10.1177/0002764212463363 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=murakami-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murakami|first=Michael H.|title=How party polarization affects candidate evaluations: the role of ideology|journal=Paper Presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, Hyatt Regency Chicago and the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers, Chicago, Illinois |year=2007|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/1/0/3/3/pages210336/p210336-1.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixit and Weibull (2007) claim that political polarization is a natural and regular phenomenon. They argue that there is a link between public differences in ideology and the polarization of representatives, but that an increase in preference differences is usually temporary and ultimately results in compromise.&lt;ref name=dixit-07&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixit|first1=Avinash K. | last2 = Weibull |first2= Jörgen W. |title=Political polarization|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|date=1 May 2007|volume=104|issue=18 |pages=7351–7356 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0702071104 |pmid=17452633 |pmc=1863477 | jstor = 25427490 | publisher = [[National Academy of Sciences]] |bibcode=2007PNAS..104.7351D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fernbach, Rogers, Fox and Sloman (2013) argue that it is a result of people having an exaggerated faith in their understanding of complex issues. Asking people to explain their policy preferences in detail typically resulted in more moderate views. Simply asking them to list the reasons for their preferences did not result in any such moderation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Religious, ethnic, and other cultural divides within the public have often influenced the emergence of polarization. According to Layman et al. (2005), the ideological split between U.S. Republicans and Democrats also crosses into the religious cultural divide. They claim that Democrats have generally become more [[moderate]] in religious views whereas Republicans have become more traditionalist. For example, political scientists have shown that in the United States, voters who identify as Republican are more likely to vote for a strongly [[evangelical]] candidate than Democratic voters.&lt;ref name=campbell-11&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=David E.|last2 = Green | first2 = John C. | last3 = Layman | first3 = Geoffrey C. |title=The party faithful: partisan images, candidate religion, and the electoral impact of party identification|journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]]|date= January 2011|volume=55|issue=1|pages=42–58 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00474.x | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This correlates with the rise in polarization in the United States.&lt;ref name=layman-05&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Layman |first1= Geoffrey C. | last2 =Green | first2 = John C. |title=Wars and rumours of wars: the contexts of cultural conflict in American political behaviour|journal=[[British Journal of Political Science]]|date=January 2006|volume=36|issue=1 |pages=61–89 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] |doi=10.1017/S0007123406000044 | jstor = 4092316 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory contends that religion does not contribute to full-group polarization, but rather, [[coalition]] and party activist polarization causes party shifts toward a political extreme.&lt;ref name=brooks-04&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sociology.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/3858/A_Great_Divide.pdf|last=Brooks|first=Clem|author2=Manza, Jeff|title=A great divide?

In some post-colonial countries, the public may be polarized along ethnic divides that remain from the colonial regime.&lt;ref name=bhavnani-08&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhavnani|first1=Ravi | last2 =Miodownik | first2= Dan|title=Ethnic polarization, ethnic salience, and Civil War |journal=[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]] |date=February 2009 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=30–49 |doi=10.1177/0022002708325945 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dc0abd133a2ecbac1ad3e0a459f39869ef89a78d }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Africa]] in the late 1980s, members of the conservative, pro-apartheid [[National Party of South Africa]] were no longer supportive of [[apartheid]], and, therefore, no longer ideologically aligned with their party. Dutch [[Afrikaners]], white English, and native Africans split based on racial divisions, causing polarization along ethnic lines.&lt;ref name=sisk-89&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sisk|first=Timothy D.|title=White politics in South Africa: politics under pressure|journal=[[Africa Today]]|date=January 1989|volume=36|issue=1 |pages=29–39 | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] |jstor=4186531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darity-09&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cpc.unc.edu/research/publications/3710| last = Darity | first = William A. | contribution = Economic theory and racial economic inequality | editor-last1 = Dodson | editor-first1 = Howard | editor-last2 = Palmer | editor-first2 = Colin A. | title = The Black condition | pages = 1–43 | publisher = Michigan State University Press | location = East Lansing, Michigan | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0870138386 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Economic inequality]] can also motivate the polarization of the public. For example, in post-[[World War I]] [[Germany]], the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany|Communist Workers Party]], and the [[Nazism|National Socialists]], a [[fascism|fascist]] party, emerged as the dominant political ideologies and proposed to address Germany's economic problems in drastically different ways.&lt;ref name=sartori-66/&gt;&lt;ref name=sartori-76/&gt; In [[Venezuela]] in the late 20th century, the entrance of the oil industry into the local economy caused economic disparities that led to sharp ideological divides. As a result, the disenfranchised working class aligned with extreme [[socialism|socialist]] leader [[Hugo Chávez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lombardi |first=John V. |contribution=Prologue: Venezuela's Permanent Dilemma |editor1-last=Ellner |editor1-first=Steve |editor2-last=Hellinger |editor2-first=Daniel |date=2004 |title=Venezuelan politics in the Chávez era: class, polarization, and conflict |publisher=Rienner |location=Boulder, Colorado |isbn=978-1588262974 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Venezuelan_Politics_in_the_Ch%C3%A1vez_Era.html?id=uYd4Q1vQluAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redistricting===
The impact of redistricting—potentially through [[Gerrymandering]] or the manipulation of electoral borders to favor a political party—on political polarization in the United States has been found to be minimal in research by leading political scientists. The logic for this minimal effect is twofold: first, gerrymandering is typically accomplished by packing opposition voters into a minority of congressional districts in a region, while distributing the preferred party's voters over a majority of districts by a slimmer majority than otherwise would have existed. The result of this is that the number of competitive congressional districts would be expected to increase, and in competitive districts representatives have to compete with the other party for the median voter, who tends to be more ideologically moderate. Second, political polarization has also occurred in the Senate, which does not experience redistricting because Senators represent fixed geographical units, i.e. states.&lt;ref name="mccarty-09"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarty|first=Nolan|author2=Poole, Keith T.|author3=Rosenthal, Howard|date=1 July 2009|title=Does Gerrymandering Cause Polarization?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x/asset/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hftg6kr2&amp;s=4b7ba41c877789fda6a4bcd3356b1b64272b0c9e|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=53|issue=3|pages=666–680|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="masket-12"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masket|first=Seth E.|author2=Winburn, Jonathan|author3=Wright, Gerald C.|date=4 January 2012|title=The Gerrymanderers Are Coming!

One difficulty in testing this hypothesis is to disentangle gerrymandering effects from natural geographical sorting through individuals moving to congressional districts with a similar ideological makeup to their own. Carson et al. (2007), has found that redistricting has contributed to the greater level of polarization in the House of Representatives than in the Senate, however that this effect has been "relatively modest".&lt;ref name=carson-07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carson|first=J.L.|author2=Crespin, M.H. |author3=Finocchiaro, C.J. |author4= Rohde, D.W. |title=Redistricting and Party Polarization in the U.S. House of Representatives|journal=American Politics Research|date=28 September 2007|volume=35|issue=6|pages=878–904|doi=10.1177/1532673X07304263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically motivated redistricting has been associated with the rise in partisanship in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1992 and 1994.&lt;ref name=mckee-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=SEth C.|title=The Effects of Redistricting on Voting Behavior in Incumbent U.S. House Elections, 1992–1994|journal=Political Research Quarterly|date=March 2008|volume=61|issue=1|pages=122–133|doi=10.1177/1065912907306473|id={{ProQuest|215329960}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kousser-96&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kousser|first=J|title=Estimating the Partisan Consequences of Redistricting Plans – Simply|journal=Legislative Studies Quarterly|date=November 1996|volume=21|issue=4|pages=521–541|doi=10.2307/440460|jstor=440460|id={{ProQuest|60821189}}|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/80620/1/sswp929.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The media===
The mass media has grown as an institution over the past half-century. Political scientists argue that this has particularly affected the voting public in the last three decades, as previously less partisan viewers are given more polarized news media choices. The mass media's current, fragmented, high-choice environment has induced a movement of the audience from more even-toned political programming to more antagonistic and one-sided broadcasts and articles. These programs tend to appeal to partisan viewers who watch the polarized programming as a self-confirming source for their ideologies.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetherington-09/&gt;&lt;ref name=hollander-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollander|first=B.A.|title=Tuning Out or Tuning Elsewhere?

(2010). ''Program or be programmed: Ten commands for a digital age.'' Berkeley, CA: Soft Skull Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This method of personalizing web content results in ''[[filter bubble]]s'', a term coined by digital activist [[Eli Pariser]] that refers to the polarized ideological bubbles that are created by computer algorithms filtering out unrelated information and opposing views.&lt;ref&gt;Pariser, E. (2011). ''The filter bubble: What the internet is hiding from you''. New York, NY: The Penguin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study found ideological segregation of online news consumption is lower than the segregation of most offline news consumption and lower than the segregation of face-to-face interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gentzkow|first=Matthew|last2=Shapiro|first2=Jesse M.|date=2011-11-01|title=Ideological Segregation Online and Offline *|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=126|issue=4|pages=1799–1839|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr044|issn=0033-5533|hdl=1811/52901|url=https://kb.osu.edu/bitstream/1811/52901/1/Mershon_ShapiroJ_photos_2011-10-27.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the filter bubbles effects of online media consumption are exaggerated. Other research also shows that online media does not contribute to the increased polarization of opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hohenberg|first=Clemm von|last2=Bernhard|last3=Maes|first3=Michael|last4=Pradelski|first4=Bary S.R.|date=2017-05-25|title=Micro influence and macro dynamics of opinions|ssrn=2974413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that providing people with impartial, objective information has the potential to reduce political polarization, but the effect of information on polarization is highly sensitive to contextual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duhaime|first=Erik|last2=Apfelbaum|first2=Evan|date=2017|title=Can Information Decrease Political Polarization?

This suggests that subtle factors like the mood and tone of partisan news sources may have a large effect on how the same information is interpreted.

===The public===

Opinions on polarization's effects on the public are mixed. Some argue that the growing polarization in government has directly contributed to political polarization in the electorate,&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt; but this is not unanimous.&lt;ref name=wilkerson-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=hibbing-08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hibbing|first=John R.|author2=Christopher W.

Some scholars argue that polarization lowers public interest in politics, [[party identification]] and [[voter turnout]].&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt; It encourages confrontational dynamics between parties that can lower overall public trust and approval in government.,&lt;ref name="hetherington-08"&gt;{{cite book|title=Red and blue nation?

Brady|location=Washington, DC|chapter=Turned Off or Turned On? How Polarization Affects Political Engagement}}&lt;/ref&gt; and causes the public to perceive the general political debate as less civil,&lt;ref name=layman-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=brady-06/&gt; which can alienate voters.

On the other hand, others assert that elite polarization has galvanized the public's political participation in the United States, citing greater voting and nonvoting participation, engagement and investment in campaigns, and increased positive attitude toward government responsiveness.&lt;ref name=hetherington-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=dodson-10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodson|first=Kyle|title=The Return of the American Voter?

===The media===

As Mann and Ornstein argue, political polarization and the proliferation of media sources have "reinforce[d] tribal divisions, while enhancing a climate where facts are no longer driving the debate and deliberation, nor are they shared by the larger public."&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;  As other scholars have argued, the media often support and provoke the stall and closed rules tactics that disrupt regular policy procedure.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=mutz-06&gt;{{cite book|last=Mutz|first=Diana C.|title=Red and blue nation?

While the media are not immune to general public opinion and reduced polarization allows them to appeal to a larger audience,&lt;ref name=rosenstiel-06&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenstiel|first=Thomas|title=Red and blue nation? Volume One: characteristics and causes of America's polarized politics|year=2006|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0815760832|chapter=Two Alternative Perspectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; polarized environments make it easier for the media and [[advocacy group|interest groups]] to hold elected officials more accountable for their policy promises and positions,&lt;ref name="epstein-07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mutz-06" /&gt; generally healthy for democracy.&lt;ref name="epstein-07" /&gt;

===Judicial systems===

[[Judicial system]]s can also be affected by the implications of political polarization. For the United States, in particular, polarization lowers confirmation rates of judges;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; In 2012, the confirmation rate of presidential circuit court appointments was approximately 50% as opposed to the above 90% rate in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=mann-12/&gt; More polarized parties have more aggressively blocked nominees and used tactics to hinder executive agendas.&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;&lt;ref name=dionne-10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dionne|first=E.J., Jr.|author2=William A.

Political scientists argue that in highly polarized periods, nominees become less reflective of the moderate voter as "polarization impacts the appointment and ideological tenor of new federal judges."&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt; It also influences the politics of senatorial [[advice and consent]], giving partisan presidents the power to appoint judges far to the left or right of center on the federal bench, obstructing the legitimacy of the judicial branch.&lt;ref name=galston-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;

Ultimately, the increasing presence of ideology in a judicial system impacts the judiciary's credibility.&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;  Polarization can generate strong partisan critiques of federal judges, which can damage the public perception of the justice system and the legitimacy of the courts as nonpartisan legal arbiters.&lt;ref name=binder-00/&gt;&lt;ref name="wittes-08"&gt;{{cite book|title=Red and blue nation?

===Foreign policy===

Political polarization can undercut unified agreement on [[foreign policy]] and harm a nation's international standing;&lt;ref name=epstein-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccormick-90&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=James M.|author2=Eugene R.

Political scientists point to two primary implications of polarization with regards to the [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy of the United States"]]. First, when the United States conducts relations abroad and appears divided, allies are less likely to trust its promises, enemies are more likely to predict its weaknesses, and uncertainty as to the country's position in world affairs rises.&lt;ref name="mccormick-90" /&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson-08&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=James Q.|title=Red and blue nation?

== Global perspective ==
Outside of the U.S., there are plenty of modern day examples of polarization in politics. A bulk of the research into global polarization comes from Europe. One example includes [[Pasokification]] in Greece. This is the trend from a shift from the center-left to a more far-left stance. Pasokification was caused by the Greek populous growing dissatisfied with the country's centrist, left wing party and how they handled the [[Great Recession]] and the austerity measures the European Union put in place during recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blackwater|first=Bill|date=Summer 2016|title=Morality and left-wing politics: a case study of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party|url=|journal=Renewal|volume=24|pages=|via=Gale Literature Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the shift further to the left was a massive benefits to the liberal population in Greece, the results in Greece (as well as other nations like Germany, Sweden and Italy) have not been able to sustain themselves. Parties who have made the shift left have recently shown a decline in the voting booths, evidence their supporters are uneasy of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eaton|first=George|date=2018|title=Corbynism 2.0|url=|journal=New Statesman|volume=147|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shift in Greece to the far-left is similar to the shift in countries like Poland, France and the U.K. to more far-right conservative positions. In those countries, there is heavy anti-Islam sentiment and the rise of [[Populism|populist]] commentary. The general population of the right in these countries tends to hold onto these more aggressive stances and pulls the parties further to the right. These stances include populist messages with Islamophobic, isolationist, and anti-LGBTQ language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarkov|first=Dubravka|date=2017-06-16|title=Populism, polarization and social justice activism|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=197–201|doi=10.1177/1350506817713439|issn=1350-5068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palonen|first=Emilia|date=2009|title=Political Polarisation and Populism in Contemporary Hungary|url=|journal=Parliamentary Affairs|volume=62|issue=2|pages=318–334|via=Electronic Journal Center|doi=10.1093/pa/gsn048}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the polarization in these nations leads to either a more socialist left wing party, or more nationalist right wing party. These more polarized parties grow from the discontent of more moderate parties inability to provide progressive changes in either direction.

== Critiques ==
There have long been numerous scholarly debates that argue over the concept of political polarization, both in whether it is valid, and how it can accurately be measured. There are four primary arguments against the validity of political polarization: 1) Limitations of the Two-Party System, 2) Issue Partisanship, 3) Cultural Differences, and 4) Westernized Focuses.

=== Limitations of the two-party system ===
By solely acknowledging voting patterns, one cannot make an accurate conclusion as to the presence or absence of political polarization, because in the United States, there is a limited number of presidential candidates in the two-party system. To assume that the majority of voters are mostly or completely in agreement with the plethora of political issues within their party is a false assumption.&lt;ref name="Baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-06" /&gt; Despite contrary beliefs, there are many liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats in the U.S. who have differing political beliefs within their parties. However, these voters most often align with their party because of the limited choice of candidates, and to do otherwise (i.e. vote for a third-party candidate) is perceived as a waste of time.&lt;ref name="Baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fiorina-08" /&gt;

=== Issue partisanship ===
Despite various claims that argue American society is more polarized today than leading up to the U.S. Civil War,&lt;ref name="abramowitz-08" /&gt; numerous scholars explain that much evidence shows there is a relatively stable public opinion on the majority of sociopolitical issues.&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Religion, politics, and support for same-sex marriage in the United States, 1988–2008|last = Sherkat|first = Darren|date = 2011|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the most polarization exists, rather, is in the "hot topic" or "sensitive" issues (e.g. abortion, gay marriage, U.S. involvement in war).&lt;ref name="layman-06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Polarization, secularization, or differences as usual? The denominational cleavage in U.S. social attitudes since the 1970s.|last = Bolzendahl|date = 2005|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-reliance on focusing on opinions regarding social issues to draw conclusion about political polarization is not a valid measurement to fully represent the concept.&lt;ref name="fiorina-08" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fiorina-06" /&gt;

In regard to views on public policies, Fiorina and Abrams (2008) found virtually no evidence of an increase in widespread political polarization over the past thirty years. Nonetheless, many scholars explain that it is not an increase in ideological coherence among individuals which separates them; it is the partisan extremism (i.e. Democrat v. Republican) which eventually separates voters into one party or the other.&lt;ref name="baldassarri-08" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Political polarization projection: Social projection of partisan attitude extremity and attitudinal processes.|last = Van Boven|date = 2012|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Religious convictions and political choice|last = Greenawalt|first = Kent|year = 1988|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural differences ===
Proponents of the cultural differences argument are critical of political polarization because of numerous factors, influences, and demographics.&lt;ref name="abramowitz-05" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Purple America|last = Ansolabehere|date = 2006|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The future of red, blue and purple America.|last = Teixeira|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among voter demographic features, there is much evidence of race, sex, age, and educational attainment as being some of the main influences in voting behaviors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130123073800/http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/how_groups_voted/voted_12.html|url-status =dead|archive-date =2013-01-23|title =U.S. elections: How groups voted in 2012|date =2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these factors, the geographic region often plays a major role in voting behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, one's socioeconomic status is a reliable predictor of voting behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:8392|title = Voting behavior based on socioeconomic status|last = Brown|date = 2009|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of these factors and influences compel researchers to reconsider the causes of political polarization.

=== Westernized focus ===
Much like many academic studies, political polarization scholars often are too narrowly focused within one nation and, thus, make broad generalizations regarding the concept from a national study. To have a better picture of the presence or absence of political polarization, scholars must consider widening the scope of their studies to the international contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Globalization's cultural consequences|last = Holton|date = 2000|journal = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Globalization and culture: Global mélange.|last = Pieterse|year = 2009|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spin room''', also known as '''spin row'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reaves|first=Jessica|title=As the Spin Room Turns|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,56609,00.html|work=Time|accessdate=2 October 2012|date=4 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''spin alley''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mathes|first=Michael|title=Spin Alley: getting out the message over debate din|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i-iFl3wU6MNVZvub-ufTpJcw7jig|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=Agence France-Presse|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TribCritic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenthal|first=Phil|title=Spin room coverage out of control|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-09-26/business/0809250750_1_post-debate-spin-operatives|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2 October 2012|date=26 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an area in which [[reporter]]s can speak with [[debate]] participants and/or their representatives after a debate. The name refers to the fact that the participants will attempt to "[[spin (public relations)|spin]]" or influence the perception of the debate among the assembled reporters. The benefit for reporters is that they quickly get in-person interviews with debaters or their representatives, complete with audio, video and photos. For a [[United States presidential election debates|U.S. presidential debate]], the number of reporters in the spin room can number into the thousands.&lt;ref name="TwitterSpin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Calderone|first=Michael|title=For 2012 Presidential Debates, Campaigns Speed Up The Spin|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/2012-presidential-debates-spin-room_n_1929185.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2 October 2012|date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest recorded spin room was set up by the [[political campaign|campaign]] of U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984. In a hotel banquet room, campaign officials spoke on the record with [[talking point]]s playing up their own candidate's debate performance and minimizing opponent [[Walter Mondale]]'s success, despite many observers believing Mondale had just won. This operation was dubbed the "spin patrol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santini|first=Maureen|title='Spin patrol' spins out|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=toNGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2229,1288893|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=The Evening News|date=13 October 1984|agency=The Associated Press|location=Newburgh-Beacon, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
A spin room may also be active before a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Zeke|title=Before The Spin Room, Campaigns Pre-Wash The Press|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/before-the-spin-room-campaigns-pre-wash-the-press|work=BuzzFeed|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common form of pre-debate spin is for each side to try to raise expectations for the opposing debater and lower expectations for their own team, a pursuit known as playing the [[expectations game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=Leigh Ann|title=What's behind the debate expectations game?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57529085/whats-behind-the-debate-expectations-game/|work=CBS News|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some observers have criticized the overt nature of the [[media manipulation]] in spin rooms, and the media's willing participation in it.&lt;ref name="TribCritic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Jay|title=Raze Spin Alley, That Strange Creation of the Press|url=http://archive.pressthink.org/2003/11/22/spin_alley.html|work=PressThink|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=22 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lanson|first=Jerry|title=The spin room - oily engine of the political meat grinder|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1212/p11s01-coop.htm|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=12 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders have said reporters know it's scripted and aren't persuaded by the spin, but rather, they use the talking points to analyze candidates' strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardman|first1=Isabel|title=A (partial) defence of the spin room|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/a-partial-defence-of-the-spin-room/|website=The Spectator|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spin rooms can occasionally include moments of candor, such as when presidential candidate [[Rick Perry]] admitted that he had "stepped in it" during a debate response that became known as his [[Rick Perry presidential campaign, 2012#November 2011: "Oops" moment and continued struggles|"oops" moment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perry in spin room explains flub: "I stepped in it" (with video)|url=http://blogs.star-telegram.com/politex/2011/11/perry-in-spin-room-explains-flub-i-stepped-in-it-with-video.html|website=PoliTex|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin rooms have also been portrayed as outdated in an era of instant online reaction from all quarters before a debate is even over.&lt;ref name="TwitterSpin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaudin|first=Sharon|title=Twitter becomes new debate spin room|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9232060/Twitter_becomes_new_debate_spin_room|work=Computer World|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Focus group]]s and instant post-debate "snap [[opinion poll|polls]]" attempt to provide a more scientific method than spin rooms in determining who has won a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US presidential debate: Early polls give Barack Obama slender victory|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/presidentialdebates/3092194/US-presidential-debate-Early-polls-give-Barack-Obama-slender-victory.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 October 2015|date=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clegg Beats Brown, Cameron in U.K. TV Debate, Polls Show|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-15/clegg-wins-top-mark-in-u-k-debate-polls-as-brown-cameron-stay-deadlocked.html|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=9 November 2012|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''postfeminism''' (alternatively rendered as '''post-feminism''') is used to describe reactions against contradictions and absences in [[feminism]], especially [[second-wave feminism]] and [[third-wave feminism]]. The term ''postfeminism'' is sometimes confused with subsequent feminisms such as [[Fourth-wave feminism|4th wave-feminism]], and "women of color feminism" (e.g. hooks, 1996; Spivak, 1999).

The ideology of postfeminism is recognized by its contrast with prevailing or preceding feminism. Some forms of postfeminism strive towards the next stage in gender-related progress, and as such is often conceived as in favor of a society that is no longer defined by [[gender binary]] and [[gender role]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} A postfeminist is a person who believes in, promotes, or embodies any of various ideologies springing from the feminism of the 1970s, whether supportive of or antagonistic towards classical feminism.

Postfeminism can be considered a critical way of understanding the changed relations between feminism, [[popular culture]] and [[femininity]]. Postfeminism may also present a critique of second-wave feminism or third-wave feminism by questioning their binary thinking and essentialism, their vision of sexuality, and their perception of relationships between femininity and feminism. It may also complicate or even deny entirely the notion that absolute gender equality is necessary, desirable or realistically achievable.

Second-wave feminism is often critiqued for being too "white", too "straight", thus resulting in the needs of women from marginalized groups and cultures being ignored. However, since [[intersectionality]] is a product of third-wave feminism, the references to such as postfeminist are open to challenge and may be more properly considered feminist.

==History of the term==
While ''postfeminism'' was first used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, it is now used as a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.  It may also be used to invoke the view that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gender.cawater-info.net/knowledge_base/rubricator/feminism_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the meaning of postfeminism has broadened in scope, encompassing many different meanings, as is the case with feminism. Within feminist literature, definitions tend to fall into two main categories: 1) “death of feminism”, “anti-feminism”, “feminism is irrelevant now” and 2) the next stage in feminism, or feminism that intersects with other “post-” philosophies/theories, such as [[postmodernism]], [[post-structuralism]] and [[postcolonialism]].

In 1919, a journal was launched in which "female literary radicals" stated "'we're interested in people now—not in men and women'", that "moral, social, economic, and political standards 'should not have anything to do with sex'", that it would "be 'pro-woman without being anti-man'", and that "their stance [is called] 'post-feminist'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy F. Cott|Cott, Nancy F.]], ''The Grounding of Modern Feminism'' (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, [2d printing?] pbk 1987 ({{ISBN|0-300-04228-0}})) (cloth {{ISBN|0-300-03892-5}}), p. 282 (author prof. American studies &amp; history, Yale Univ.) (book is largely on U.S. feminism in 1910s–1920s) (n. 23 (at end) omitted) (n. 23 (in full): "23. ''Judy'' 1:1 (Jun. 1919); 2:3 (1919), n.p., SL." ("SL" in small capitals &amp; abbreviating "The Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts", per ''id.'', p. 285 (Abbreviations Used in Notes (Libraries)))).&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used in the 1980s to describe a backlash against [[second-wave feminism]]. Postfeminism is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;Wright, Elizabeth, ''Lacan and Postfeminism'' (Icon Books, 2000), {{ISBN|978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other postfeminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tania Modleski|Modleski, Tania]]. Feminism without Women: Culture and Criticism in a "Postfeminist" Age. New York: Routledge, 1991, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the postfeminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and were overly generalizing in their criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Amelia. "Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art," New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action, Eds. Joana Frueh, Cassandra L. Langer and Arlene Raven. New York: HarperCollins, 1994. 16–41, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s saw the popularization of this term, in both the academic world as well as the media world. It was seen as a term of both commendation and scorn. [[Toril Moi]], a professor at Duke University, originally coined the term in 1985 in Sexual/Textual politics to advocate a feminism that would deconstruct the binary between equality based on "liberal" feminism and difference-based or "radical" feminism. There is confusion surrounding the intended meaning of "post" in the context of "postfeminism". This confusion has plagued the very meaning of "postfeminism" since the 1990s. While the term has seemed on the one hand to announce the end of feminism, on the other hand it has itself become a site of feminist politics.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 4149214|title = Feminism, Ethics, and History, or What is the "Post" in Postfeminism?|journal = Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 29–44|last1 = Kavka|first1 = Misha|year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, feminist history is characterized by the struggle to find out the present situation—often articulated as a concern about whether there is still such a thing called "feminism"—by writing in the past. It is here that the meaning of "post" as a historical break is troubling, for "post" offers to situate feminism in history by proclaiming the end of this history. It then confirms feminist history as a thing of the past. However, some claim that it is impossible that feminism could be aligned with "post" when it is unthinkable, as it would be the same as calling the current world a post racist, post-classist, and post-sexist society.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

==Characteristics==

The early part of the 1980s was when the media began labeling teenage women and women in their twenties the "postfeminist generation". After twenty years, the term postfeminist is still used to refer to young women, "who are thought to benefit from the women's movement through expanded access to employment and education and new family arrangements but at the same time do not push for further political change", Pamela Aronson, Professor of Sociology, asserts. Postfeminism is a highly debated topic since it implies that feminism is "dead" and "because the equality it assumes is largely a myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Feminists or "Postfeminists"?: Young Women's Attitudes toward Feminism and Gender Relations | journal = Gender and Society | year = 2003 | first = Pamela | last = Aronson | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 903–22 | doi=10.1177/0891243203257145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Diane Davis|Prof. D. Diane Davis]], postfeminism is just a continuation of what first- and second-wave feminisms want.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Debra Diane, ''Breaking Up [at] Totality: A Rhetoric of Laughter'' (Carbondale: Southern Ill. Univ. Press, 2000 ({{ISBN|0-8093-2228-5}})), p. 141 n. 8 (brackets in title so in original) (author asst. prof. rhetoric, Univ. of Iowa).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted at Kent State University narrowed postfeminism to four main claims: support for feminism declined; women began hating feminism and feminists; society had already attained social equality, thus making feminism outdated; and the label "feminist" was disliked due to negative stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Elaine J.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Marnie Salupo|date=2003|title=The Myth of Postfeminism|jstor=3594675|journal=Gender and Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=878–902|doi=10.1177/0891243203257639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PPp7dfrNTroC&amp;pg=PP1#v=snippet&amp;q=rodriguez&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives|last=Abbott|first=Pamela|last2=Tyler|first2=Melissa|last3=Wallace|first3=Claire|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=9781134382453|location=|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of postfeminist work==

In her 1994 book ''[[Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women]]'', [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] considers much of modern academic [[feminist theory]] and the feminist movement to be [[gynocentrism|gynocentric]]. She labels this "[[Who Stole Feminism?|gender feminism]]" and proposes "[[equity feminism]]"—an ideology that aims for full civil and legal equality. She argues that while the feminists she designates as gender feminists advocate preferential treatment and portray women as victims, equity feminism provides a viable alternative form of feminism.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;Hoff Sommers, Christina, Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; These descriptions and her other work have caused Hoff Sommers to be described as an antifeminist by some other feminists.&lt;ref name=Flood&gt;Flood, Michael (7 July 2004). "Backlash: Angry men's movements", in Stacey Elin Rossi, ed.: The Battle and Backlash Rage On. N.p.: XLibris, 273. {{ISBN|1-4134-5934-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Uncovering the Right—Female Anti-Feminism for Fame and Profit |url=http://organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html |accessdate=2007-12-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215141226/http://www.organizenow.net/cco/right/antifem.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary feminists, such as [[Katha Pollitt]] or [[Nadine Strossen]], consider feminism to hold simply that "women are people." Views that separate the sexes rather than unite them are considered by these writers to be ''sexist'' rather than ''feminist''.&lt;ref name=Pollitt&gt;Pollitt, Katha, ''Reasonable Creatures: Essays on Women and Feminism '' (Vintage, 1995) {{ISBN|978-0-679-76278-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strossen&gt;Strossen, Nadine, ''Defending Pornography: Free Speech, Sex, and the Fight for Women's Rights'' (Prentice Hall &amp; IBD, 1995), {{ISBN|978-0-684-19749-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amelia Jones]] has authored post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s/1990s and portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity and criticized it using generalizations.

One of the earliest modern uses of the term was in Susan Bolotin's 1982 article "Voices of the Post-Feminist Generation", published in ''[[New York Times Magazine]]''. This article was based on a number of interviews with women who largely agreed with the goals of feminism, but did not identify as feminists.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Ruth. The World Split Open: How the Modern Women's Movement Changed America. New York: Viking, 2000, 275, 337.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Faludi]], in her 1991 book ''[[Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women]]'', argued that a backlash against second wave feminism in the 1980s had successfully re-defined feminism through its terms. She argued that it constructed the [[women's liberation movement]] as the source of many of the problems alleged to be plaguing women in the late 1980s. She also argued that many of these problems were illusory, constructed by the media without reliable evidence. According to her, this type of backlash is a historical trend, recurring when it appeared that women had made substantial gains in their efforts to obtain equal rights.&lt;ref name=Faludi_Backlash&gt;Faludi, Susan, ''Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women'' (Three Rivers Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Angela McRobbie]] argued that adding the prefix ''post-'' to ''feminism'' undermined the strides that feminism made in achieving equality for everyone, including women. In McRobbie's opinion, postfeminism gave the impression that equality has been achieved and feminists could now focus on something else entirely. McRobbie believed that postfeminism was most clearly seen on so-called feminist media products, such as ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary]], [[Sex and the City]]'', and ''[[Ally McBeal]]''. Female characters like Bridget Jones and [[Carrie Bradshaw]] claimed to be liberated and clearly enjoy their sexuality, but what they were constantly searching for was the one man who would make everything worthwhile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = McRobbie | first = Angela | author-link = Angela McRobbie | title = Post‐feminism and popular culture | journal = [[Feminist Media Studies]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–264 | doi = 10.1080/1468077042000309937 | date = 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representations of post feminism can be found in pop culture. Postfeminism has been seen in media as a form of feminism that accepts popular culture instead of rejecting it, as was typical with second wave feminists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feasey|first=Rebecca|date=7 August 2010|title=Charmed: Why Teen Television Appeals to Women|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|volume=34:1|pages=2–9|doi=10.3200/JPFT.34.1.2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many popular shows from the 90s and early 2000s are considered to be postfeminist works because they tend to focus on women who are empowered by popular cultural representations of other women. Because of this, postfeminists claimed that such media was more accessible and inclusive than past representations of women in the media; however, some feminists believe that postfeminist works focus too much on white, middle-class women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such shows and movies include ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]], [[Xena: Warrior Princess]], [[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]],'' and ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].'' Another example is ''Sex and the City''. Carrie Bradshaw from ''Sex and the City'' is an example of a character living a post feminist life. While her character attempts to live a sexually liberated lifestyle, Bradshaw is stuck endlessly pursuing the love and validation of a man. The balance between Bradshaw's independent life as a successful columnist and desire to find a husband exemplifies the tension of post feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerhard|first=Jane|date=August 2006|title=Sex and the City, Feminist Media Studies|url=|journal=Feminist Media Studies|volume=5|pages=37–49|via=|doi=10.1080/14680770500058173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these works also involve women monitoring their appearance as a form of self-management, be it in the form of dieting, exercise, or—most popularly—makeover scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politicsandculture.org/2009/11/09/post-feminism-in-popular-culture-a-potential-for-critical-resistance/|title=Post feminism in popular culture: A potential for critical resistance?|date=2009-11-09|work=Politics and Culture|access-date=2018-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist literature—also known as [[Chick lit|chicklit]]—has been criticized by feminists for similar themes and notions. However, the genre is also praised for being confident, witty, and complicated, bringing in feminist themes, revolving around women, and reinventing standards of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/writingpostfeminism/gutsy|title=What is chick-lit? {{!}} Electronic Book Review|website=www.electronicbookreview.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples can also be found in ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]''. The novels explore the complexity of girlhood in a society that assumes gender equality, which is in line with postfeminism. The constant surveillance and self policing of the series' protagonists depicts the performance of heterosexuality, hyperfemininity, and critical gaze forced upon girls. The materialism and performance from the girls in ''Pretty Little Liars'' critiques the notion that society has full gender equality, and thus offers a critique of postfeminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitney|first1=Sarah|title=Kisses, Bitches: Pretty Little Liars Frames Postfeminism's Adolescent Girl|journal=Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature|date=11 November 2017|volume=36|issue=2|pages=353–377|doi=10.1353/tsw.2017.0026|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/677146|language=en|issn=1936-1645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on print jewelry advertisements in Singapore, Michelle Lazar analyses how the construction of 'postfeminist' femininity has given rise to a [[neo-liberal]] hybrid "pronounced sense of self or 'I-dentity'". She states that the increasing number of female wage earners has led to advertisers updating their image of women but that "through this hybrid postfeminist I-dentity, advertisers have found a way to reinstall a new normativity that coexists with the status quo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lazar | first = Michelle | title = Recuperating feminism, reclaiming femininity: Hybrid postfeminist I-dentity in consumer advertisements | journal = [[Gender and Language]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–224 | doi = 10.1558/genl.v8i2.205 | year = 2014 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postfeminist ads and fashion have been criticized for using femininity as a commodity veiled as liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://americanaejournal.hu/vol7no2/kulcsar|title=AMERICANA: "A Critique of Post-feminism" by Zsófia Kulcsár|website=americanaejournal.hu|access-date=2018-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''public interest''' is "the welfare &lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT hyperlink [[welfare]]; the article is about a different usage of the word --&gt; or [[well-being]] of the general public" and [[society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/public+interest "Public interest"], ''[[Random House Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Economist Lok Sang Ho in his ''Public Policy and the Public Interest''&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, 2012 (first published published in 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the public interest must be assessed impartially and, therefore, defines the public interest as the "''[[ex ante]]'' welfare of the representative individual." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.routledge.com/Public-Policy-and-the-Public-Interest-1st-Edition/Ho/p/book/9780415664660|title=Public Policy and the Public Interest: 1st Edition (Hardback) - Routledge|website=Routledge.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a [[thought experiment]], by assuming that there is an equal chance for one to be anyone in society and, thus, could benefit or suffer from a change, the public interest is by definition enhanced whenever that change is preferred to the status quo ''ex ante''. This approach is "''ex ante''", in the sense that the change is not evaluated after the fact but assessed before the fact without knowing whether one would actually benefit or suffer from it.

This approach follows the "[[veil of ignorance]]" approach, which was first proposed by [[John Harsanyi]] but popularized by [[John Rawls]] in his 1971 ''Theory of Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, John (1971) ''A Theory of Justice'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, however, the approach can be traced to [[John Stuart Mill]], who, in his letter to [[George Grote]], explained that "human happiness, even one's own, is in general more successfully pursued by acting on general rules, than by measuring the consequences of each act; and this is still more the case with the general happiness, since any other plan would not only leave everybody uncertain what to expect, but would involve perpetual quarrelling..."&lt;ref&gt;Francis E. Mineka and Dwight N. Lindley (ed.), ''The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume XIV - The Later Letters of John Stuart Mill 1849-1873 Part I, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1972, Vol. XV, p.&amp;nbsp;762, 1862.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] argues that applying a detailed definition is likely to result in [[unintended consequences]], in [http://www.icaew.com/publicinterest Acting in the Public Interest](2012). Instead, each circumstance needs to be assessed based on criteria such as the relevant public, wants, and constraints. The key to assessing any public interest decision is transparency of the decision-making process, including balancing competing interests.

==Law==
{{main|Public interest law}}
[[File:Brandeis office 1916.jpg|thumb|Brandeis (center) in his office 1916.]]
“Public interest law” is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built upon a tradition exemplified by [[Louis Brandeis]], who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. 
In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that “able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.” &lt;ref&gt;Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. "Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists" (http://www.pilnet.org/component/docman/doc_download/35-pursuing-the-public-interest-a-handbook-for-legal.html); Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14(2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek “relevance” in their work — wishing to have an effect on the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the “corporate adjuncts” referred to by Brandeis.&lt;ref&gt;Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth &amp; Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

Public interest law does not describe a body of law or a legal field; the term was adopted to describe whom the public interest lawyers were representing, rather than what matters they would work on. Instead of representing powerful economic interests, they chose to be advocates for otherwise underrepresented individuals. Consequently, a significant current in public interest lawyering has always emphasized the need to provide legal services to those living in poverty. The term has grown, however, to encompass a broader range of activities of lawyers and non-lawyers working toward a multitude of objectives, including civil rights, civil liberties, women’s rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on. Nevertheless, a common denominator for public interest lawyers in the United States and in a growing number of countries remains the ethic of “fighting for the little guy”—that is, representing the underrepresented and vulnerable segments of society.&lt;ref name=Cummings&gt;Scott L. Cummings &amp; Ingrid V. Eagly, After Public Interest Law, NWU L. Rev. 1251, 1251-1259, 2075-2077(2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

Public interest has been considered as the core of "democratic theories of government” and often paired with two other concepts, "[[convenience]]" and "[[Need|necessity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Napoli, Philip M. (2001). Foundations of Communications Policy. Principles and Process in the Regulation of Electronic Media. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press&lt;/ref&gt; Public interest, convenience and necessity appeared for the first time in the [[Transportation Act of 1920]] and also appeared in the [[Radio Act of 1927]]. After that, these three concepts became critical criteria for making communication policies and solving some related disputes.

A '''political faction''' is a group of individuals within a larger entity, such as a [[political party]], a [[trade union]] or other group, or simply a [[political climate]], united by a particular common political purpose that differs in some respect to the rest of the entity. A faction or political party may include fragmented sub-factions, "parties within a party," which may be referred to as power blocs, or voting blocs. Members of factions band together as a way of achieving these goals and advancing their agenda and position within an organization.

Factions are not limited to political parties; they can and frequently do form within any group that has some sort of political aim or purpose.

The Latin word ''factio'' denoted originally either of the chariot teams that were organized professionally by private companies in ancient Rome, each recognizable by characteristic colour and arousing supporter hysteria similar to that in modern sports fans. These teams were not unlike gladiator schools, but the lethal nature of that entertainment meant few performers lasted long enough to build up similar crowd loyalty to the "team", while the fighters rarely actually teamed up, but rather fought duels or beasts. In time, political currents could become associated with such a team, although precisely how this happened is unclear. In Byzantine Constantinople, two such chariot factions, blue and green, repeatedly made or broke the claims of candidates to the imperial throne.

Occasionally, the term "faction" is still used more or less as a synonym for political party, but "with opprobrious sense, conveying the imputation of selfish or mischievous ends or turbulent or unscrupulous methods", according to the Oxford English Dictionary. In his Dictionary, Samuel Johnson (a [[Tory]]) dismissively defined [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] as "the name of a faction". Similarly, in the tenth installment of The Federalist Papers, [[James Madison]] defines a faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community." In plain English, this is a group that pursues self-interest at the expense of the greater good.

==Aims of factions==
The aims of a political faction are as diverse as the different types of bodies within which they appear. Typically, however, they include: advancing a particular [[policy]] or policy agenda, preventing the adoption of alternative policies and supporting given individuals to positions of power within the organisation or in the wider political world.  A faction can primarily be based around supporting a given person or group, or a single major aim, with little in the way of common agenda otherwise, or it can have a comprehensive and definitive set of policies.  Either way, factional politics typically revolve around personality, with a few individuals playing key roles, acting as a magnet for like-minded people, leading the activities of the faction, and acting as a prominent voice for the shared objectives of the faction. Such individuals can be referred to by a variety of names, such as “power brokers” or “factional chiefs”.

==Organization==
&lt;!--Please DO NOT change the spelling of "organization" to "organization". See [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English]].--&gt;
Factions differ in the amount of organization and internal structure they possess. On the left, these may take the form of tendencies or [[platform (European politics)|platforms]]. Most factions are very loose organizations, having no definitive list of members, but some factions, have a formal internal structure, with membership lists, regular meetings, official positions – such as negotiators, conveners, [[whip (politics)|whips]] and organisers, – and a definitive policy position on every issue affecting the broader organization. Such factions will typically be binding; that is, they rely upon all members casting their votes in accordance with the pre-ordained official stance of the faction.

==Operation of factions==
In political organizations that are [[democracy|democratic]] in structure, factions rely heavily on securing enough votes to win important ballots. This process is sometimes referred to as “doing the numbers”. Having the numbers will allow the faction to push policies it supports and elect its members to powerful positions within the broader organisation.

If one faction develops within an organization, there will usually be at least one other that develops in opposition to it. Opposing factions will try to match each other's level of organization and internal discipline, but will also engage in negotiations and trade-offs to ensure that the organization’s activities are not compromised and that every group has a chance to obtain at least some of its goals.

Key to the operation of an organized faction is the existence of a power base. This will typically be some office, division or branch of the broader organisation over which the faction has effective control. Sometimes a power base may be an external or affiliated organization that is involved with the broader organization in some way.

A power base serves several key functions:
* It acts as a recruitment centre for new members, and promotes homogeneity within the membership (crucial for maintaining factional cohesion);
* It can be used as an organizing centre for factional events and activities;
* It functions as a springboard, advancing the career of selected factional members and allowing them to gain skills that will increase their effectiveness and clout.

==Effects of factions==
The existence of a factional system can have serious negative consequences for a political organisation.  If factional strife becomes intensive and public, the organisation may suffer from perceptions of disunity. Taken one step further, if the conflict is particularly severe, it may cause ruptures within the organisation that seriously impede its effectiveness, leading to break-up or collapse of the organisation.

To avoid harm to the organisation, factional operations are usually conducted under strong secrecy and with minimal public scrutiny. This, however, can lead to the proliferation of unethical behaviour. Warfare between the factions may lead to tactics such as ballot box-stuffing, stack-outs, membership fraud, and other generally fraudulent conduct. Individuals who abandon a faction may be subject to intense personal [[Feud|vendettas]] where their former comrades go about sabotaging their careers.  A climate of intense factional conflict can also motivate individuals to focus on attacking their factional enemies rather than furthering the broader organisation.

Despite this, the benefits of factional systems are often overlooked. It is often incomprehensible to outsiders why members of a broader organisation would engage in factionalism. This stems from the assumption that the natural factional relationship is one of conflict and strife, when in fact, factions are often able to engage in productive co-operation.

In any political organisation there are likely to be many highly opinionated and passionate people. The existence of a factional system allows its operations to be more predictable and stable. Compromise and give-and-take between factions allows the organisation to operate without having to satisfy the whims of many different, uncompromising individuals who might otherwise cause a split. So, somewhat counter-intuitively, factionalism can actually promote organisational harmony.

Factions also help to broaden and diversify the organisation’s appeal. A person who might otherwise find the organisation’s goals unattractive might be persuaded to support a faction within it whose goals are closer to their own. Just as a democratic [[government]] is often invigorated by a strong [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]], so having a number of distinct points-of-view with an organisation can energise it and allow it to perform its role more effectively. It is also highly unlikely that any sizeable political organisation is wholly united in purpose, so arguably factions simply represent a way of managing pre-existing differences within the organisation.

The Founding Fathers of the American constitution, explicitly warned against the dangers of party factionalism. Madison, Hamilton, and Washington expressed the belief that factions would create divides that would ultimately dismantle the government. These sentiments can be found in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', specifically Federalist 10 and 51 written by Madison.

: ''This article is about the history of ethnic Jews and political radicalism. For the antisemitic canard, see [[Jewish Bolshevism]].''

The historical contribution of Jews to the political Left has been well documented. Both as individual theorists and activists of the stature of [[Karl Marx]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], [[Léon Blum]] and [[Emma Goldman]], and as organised mass labour movements in, for example, revolutionary Russia and early-mid twentieth century Warsaw, Amsterdam, Paris, Toronto, New York and London. 

Historical analysis of the dynamics of this Jewish/Left alliance, however, has been far less conclusive. Considerable dissonance exists, for example, concerning the factors which attracted Jews to the Left, the extent to which leading Jewish Left activists were originally motivated by or subsequently influenced by explicitly Jewish concerns, and the degree to which one can reasonably speak of a specific or unique Jewish contribution to the international Left. In addition, discussion of these factors has often been inhibited by concerns regarding the use of the alleged Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy by the Nazis and other anti-Semitic groups.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==History==

According to Paul Johnson, Jewish society in the last 1,500 years has been designed to produce and support intellectuals who largely focused their talents on rabbinical studies.  Johnson asserts that "quite suddenly, around the year 1800, this ancient and highly efficient social machine for the production of intellectuals began to shift its output. Instead of pouring all its products into the closed circuit of rabbinical studies, . . . it unleashed a significant and ever-growing proportion of them into secular life. This was an event of shattering importance in world history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Jews |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofjews00john |url-access=registration |first=Paul |last=Johnson |year=1988 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofjews00john/page/340 340–341]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[French Revolution|French Revolution of 1789]] promised equality, freedom, and an end to discrimination for all including the Jews. The subsequent political emancipation of the Jews in most of Western and Central Europe provoked an anti-modern and specifically anti-Jewish backlash from traditional conservative groupings. In response, Jews allied themselves with the modern liberalist forces, and played an important role in the 1848 European revolutions which sought to entrench the gains of liberalism. However, the ensuing failure of liberalism to protect Jewish rights led many Jews to seek new allies within the growing working-class movement. The international character of the socialist movement seemingly offered Jews protection from old religious and national hatreds. Thus in contrast to most other national groups, Jews had a double reason to join the proletarian revolution. They were discriminated against both on class grounds and on racial grounds.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Not surprisingly, many Jews made a rational decision to join a movement which promised to defend and extend the equal rights granted by the French Revolution. The prominence of Jews in the Left can, therefore, be attributed to reasons of self-interest as much as to any idealistic motivation. Equally, the subsequent decline of Jewish involvement in the Left can be attributed to relatively objective factors such as the creation of the State of Israel which transformed Jewish dependence from international to national forces.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==20th century==
Many young Jews rejected the Orthodoxy of their parents and turned to the great Jewish secular movements of [[Zionism]], [[socialism]], and [[Bundism]] [a Jewish labor movement founded in Eastern Europe in the 19th century]. They viewed their parents' faith in the eventual coming of the Messiah as a dangerous passivity in the face of imminent danger to the Jewish people. They took their fate into their own hands and created new forms of secular Jewish messianic activity. Their concern for changing the world by rejecting their religious background shows how deeply they were immersed in the Jewish search for redemption.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Jewish Bolshevism===
A persistent theme among antisemites—particularly those on the pre-World War II right—has been that the [[Bolshevik]] revolution was a Jewish revolution and that the Soviet Union was dominated by Jews. This theme appears in a wide range of writings, from Henry Ford's [[The International Jew|International Jew]], to published statements by a long list of British, French, and American political figures in the 1920s (Sir [[Winston Churchill]], [[Woodrow Wilson]], and [[David Lloyd George]]), and, in its most extreme form, by [[Adolf Hitler]], who wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Now begins the last great revolution. By wresting political power for himself, the Jew casts off the few remaining shreds of disguise he still wears. The democratic plebeian Jew turns into the blood Jew and the tyrant of peoples. In a few years he will try to exterminate the national pillars of intelligence and, by robbing the peoples of their natural spiritual leadership, will make them ripe for the slavish lot of a permanent subjugation. The most terrible example of this is Russia."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Politics of the International Space Station''' have been affected by superpower rivalries, international treaties and funding arrangements. The [[Cold War]] was an early factor, overtaken in recent years by United States distrust of China. The station has an international crew, with the use of their time, and that of equipment on the station, being governed by treaties between participant nations.

==Usage of crew and hardware==

The space agencies that participate in the [[International Space Station]] are the United States' [[NASA]], Russia's [[Roscosmos State Corporation|Roscosmos]], Japan's [[JAXA]], Europe's [[European Space Agency|ESA]] and Canada's [[Canadian Space Agency|CSA]]. The Russian part of the station is operated and controlled by Roscosmos and provides Russia with the right to nearly one-half of the crew time for the ISS. The allocation of remaining crew time (three to four crew members of the total permanent crew of six) and hardware within the other sections of the station is as follows: ''[[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]]'': 51% for the ESA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; ''[[Japanese Experiment Module|Kibō]]'': 51% for the JAXA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_japan.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Government of Japan Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=24 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Destiny (ISS module)|Destiny]]'': 97.7% for NASA and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_csa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Canadian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crew time, electrical power and rights to purchase supporting services (such as data upload and download and communications) are divided 76.6% for NASA, 12.8% for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manifest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/iss_manifest.html|title=Consolidated Launch Manifest|accessdate=8 July 2008|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSSM"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Harland|title=The Story of Space Station Mir|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York Inc|date=30 November 2004|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-23011-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/storyofspacestat0000harl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1972 a milestone was reached in co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union in space with the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. The project occurred during a period of [[détente]] between the two superpowers, and led in July 1975 to [[Soyuz 19]] docking with an [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo]] spacecraft. 

From 1978 to 1987, the USSR's [[Interkosmos]] program included allied Warsaw Pact countries, and countries which were not Soviet allies, such as India, Syria and France, in crewed and uncrewed missions to Space stations Salyut 6 and 7. In 1986, the USSR extended its co-operation to a dozen countries in the [[Mir]] program. From 1994 to 1998, NASA Space Shuttles and crew visited Mir in the [[Shuttle–Mir program]]. 

In 1998, assembly of the space station began.&lt;ref name="OnOrbit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |title=On-Orbit Elements |publisher=NASA |author=NASA |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029013438/http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 January 1998, the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) was signed. This governs ownership of modules, station usage by participant nations, and responsibilities for station resupply. The signatories were the United States of America, Russia, Japan, Canada and eleven member states of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom).&lt;ref name="PartStates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html|title=Human Spaceflight and Exploration—European Participating States|accessdate=17 January 2009|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|title=ISS Intergovernmental Agreement|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=19 April 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610083738/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|archivedate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the United Kingdom, all of the signatories went on to contribute to the Space Station project. A second layer of agreements was then achieved, a memoranda of understanding between NASA and ESA, CSA, RKA and JAXA. These agreements are then further split, such as for the contractual obligations between nations, and trading of partners' rights and obligations.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; Use of the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] is also negotiated at this level.&lt;ref name="RSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_rsa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Russian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ISS Agreements.jpg|thumb|right|Dated January 29, 1998]]

In 2010, the ESA announced that European countries which were not already part of the program would be allowed access to the station in a three-year trial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/EU_mulls_opening_ISS_to_more_countries_999.html|title=EU mulls opening ISS to more countries|publisher=Space-travel.com|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, a meeting in Quebec City between the leaders of the space agencies of Canada, Japan, Russia, the United States and involved European nations resulted in a renewed pledge to maintain the space station until at least 2020. NASA reports to be still committed to the principles of the mission but also to use the station in new ways, which were not elaborated. CSA President Steve MacLean stated his belief that the station's [[Canadarm]] will continue to function properly until 2028, alluding to Canada's likely extension of its involvement beyond 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vancouversun.com/technology/Canada+renews+pledge+International+Space+Station+until+2020/6235789/story.html Canada renews pledge to International Space Station until 2020.] The Vancouver Sun. 1 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{External links|date=May 2019}}
In [[financial regulation]], a '''politically exposed person''' ('''PEP''') is one who has been entrusted with a prominent public function. A PEP generally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in [[bribery]] and [[corruption]] by virtue of their position and the influence that they may hold. The terms politically exposed person and '''senior foreign political figure''' are often used interchangeably, particularly in international forums.  [[Foreign official]] is a term for individuals deemed as government persons under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] or FCPA, and although definitions are similar to PEP, there are quite a few differences and should not be used interchangeably.  The term PEP is typically used referring to customers in the financial services industry, while 'foreign official' refers to the risks of third party relationships in all industries.

==Definition by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering==
While there is no global definition of a PEP, most countries have based their definition on the 2003 [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) standard, as for example the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority|Swiss financial market regulator]] in 2011, which quoted it as "the international standard"&lt;ref name="FINMA Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Due diligence obligations of Swiss banks when handling assets of "politically exposed persons".|url=http://www.finma.ch/e/aktuell/Documents/bericht_pep-abkl%C3%A4rung_20111110_e.pdf|date=10 November 2011|publisher=Eidgenoessische Finanzmarktaufsicht (FINMA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Australian government in 2015.&lt;ref name="Austrac Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft guidance note 15/01. Key terms used in 'politically exposed person' definition.|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/draft-gn1501-pep.docx|date=January 2015|publisher=Australian government|author=Australian Transaction reports and Analysis Center(Austrac)|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
FATF is an international inter-governmental body, founded in 1989 on the initiative of the [[G7]] and hosted by the [[OECD]], to set standards and promote implementing measures against [[money laundering]], [[financing of terrorism]] and financing of proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to preserve the integrity of the [[global financial system]].&lt;ref name="FATF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF_Recommendations.pdf|title=INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM &amp; PROLIFERATION|author=FATF|publisher=ATF/OECD|date=15 February 2012|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In February 2012, the FATF's latest definition of politically exposed persons (PEP), revised from 2003, is as follows:&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|123}} 
*''Foreign PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example [[Head of state|Heads of state]] or [[Head of government|Heads of government]], senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. 
*''Domestic PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with prominent public functions, for example Heads of State or of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. (Not all countries subscribe to the concept of domestic PEPs with respect to regulatory requirements/application of due diligence. For example, US law, specifically Section 312 of the USA Patriot Act and its implementing regulations provide for enhanced due diligence for SFPFs (Senior Foreign Political Figure) only, defined as: "a current or former senior official in the executive, legislative, administrative, military, or judicial branches of a 'foreign' government...a senior official of a major 'foreign' political party; and a senior executive of a 'foreign' government-owned commercial enterprise.)
*Persons who are or have been entrusted with a prominent function by a [[state owned enterprise]] or an [[international organisation]] refers to members of [[senior management]], i.e. directors, deputy directors and members of the board or equivalent functions.

Requirements for a PEP apply to [[family member]]s or close associates, any individual publicly known, or known by the financial institution to be a close personal or professional associate.&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|18}}
"The FATF definition is not intended to include middle-ranking or more junior individuals."&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|121}}

A forerunner definition was by the 1997 [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] aimed at reducing corruption in developing countries, which came into force February 1999; it used the term 'foreign official'.

==Implementation==
Most of the 37 FATF member countries treat domestic and foreign PEPs with heightened [[scrutiny]].  
The FATF guidance implies that if a person is a foreign PEP, it ''de facto'' makes them a domestic PEP in their own country. This makes sense for crime prevention, because to export proceeds of crime, the PEP must first use their own domestic financial system and thus, importance is placed on domestic, and non-foreign PEPs.

===Australia===
Under Australia's AML/CTF Rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/businesses/legislation/amlctf-act|title=AML/CTF Act|first=Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre|last=(AUSTRAC)|date=30 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically exposed persons (PEPs) are individuals who occupy a prominent public position or functions in a government body or international organisation, both within and outside Australia. This definition also extends to their immediate family members and close associates.

The AML/CTF Rules define three categories of PEPs:

* Domestic PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an Australian government body
* Foreign PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in a government body of a foreign country.
* International organisation PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an international organisation.

A reporting entity must have procedures to identify whether any individual customer or beneficial owner is a PEP, or an associate of a PEP. The reporting entity must undertake this identification process before it provides the customer with a designated service, or as soon as practicable afterwards. A reporting entity must implement additional due diligence measures and risk management systems where the PEP is high ML/TF risk or is a foreign PEP.

===Canada===
Canada considers all foreign PEPs to pose a money laundering and terrorist financing risk. Under the amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act that came into effect in 2016, a politically exposed person now also includes all domestic PEPs and Heads of International Organisations (HIOs). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://complyadvantage.com/pep-screening-and-monitoring-in-canada/|title=PEP Screening &amp; Monitoring in Canada|last=|first=|date=7 June 2017|website=ComplyAdvantage|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic PEPs in Canada retain their classification until 5 years after they leave office. This rule applies even if the PEP is not considered high risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/peps-politically-exposed-persons-canada/|title=Politically Exposed Persons in Canada|last=|first=|date=18 October 2019|website=ComplyAdvantage|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Chile===
{{See also|Banco de Chile#Controversies{{!}}Banco de Chile}}

In Chile, financial institutions are mandated to report any transaction suspicious for potential involvement in bribery by virtue of a PEP's position and the influence that they may hold. {{As of| 2015}}, 2,200 to 3,000 individuals are considered PEPs, 150 of them foreign, and also their second grade relatives are under financial observation by the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Chilean newspaper ''[[La Tercera]]'' 22 February 2015, [http://www.latercera.com/noticia/negocios/2015/02/655-617858-9-pep-asi-opera-la-vigilancia-financiera-a-la-clase-politica.shtml PEP: así opera la vigilancia financiera a la clase política] Fernando Vega, retrieved on 22 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The European Union has defined the term ''politically exposed person'' in the directive 2006/70/EC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32006L0070 Commission Directive 2006/70/EC]&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Financial Intelligence Centre amended the Financial Intelligence Centre Act to refer to Politically Influential Persons (PIP) instead of PEP. This was done in order to include private sector officials who have business dealings with public sector officials and elected officials in the public services procurement deals.

===UK===
{{As of |June 2017}} likewise the UK's PEP definition is identical to the 2012 FATF definition, i.e. including reference to domestic PEPs; It is found in the Money Laundering Regulations 2017 Section 35(12).&lt;ref name=uk&gt;{{cite web|title=The Money Laundering Regulations 2017|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/692/regulation/35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A politically exposed person is considered any individual who fits any of the criteria listed below:

* A foreign person who has held any time in the preceding year a prominent public function outside the United Kingdom, in a state or international institution
* Members of courts of auditors or of the boards of central banks
* Ambassadors, chargés d’affaires and high-ranking officers in the armed forces
* Members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of state-owned enterprises
* Heads of state, heads of government, ministers and deputy or assistant ministers
* Members of parliaments
* Members of supreme courts, constitutional courts or of other high-level judicial bodies
The definition explicitly excludes middle-ranking or more junior officials.

PEP status also extends to relatives and close associates. Relatives and close associates include a spouse, a partner, children and their spouses or partners and parents. While other family members may not qualify under this definition, it may be appropriate to consider that other family members can also be used as a front for corrupt activities.  Therefore it may be appropriate to apply the definition to other extended family members that may have increased risk factors present and apply the requirements of the regulation (e.g. a PEP with material negative information may use their brother as a front for processing their proceeds of corruption).  Close associates include any individual who is known to have joint beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement, or any other close business relations. It also includes any individual who has sole beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement which is known to have been set up for the benefit of a person referred to in regulation.

The [[Financial Conduct Authority]] and Joint Money Laundering Steering Group both publish comprehensive guidance on both PEPs and other KYC related matters to assist firms in complying with their legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-fca.org.uk/money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing|title=FCA Information on Money Laundering &amp; Terrorist Financing|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th EU AML Directive is expected update the definition to include domestic PEPs, and limit relatives-status to spouse and partner only, and no longer the children and parents of PEPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMLD4 and Domestic PEPS

The term [[foreign official]] has been used by US enforcement agencies relating to persons who have similar characteristics as PEPs, as referenced in the US [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] {{UnitedStatesCode|15|78dd-1}}. It is used in all industries, not only by financial institutions. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]]'s [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN) did not use the term PEP in its regulations as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/testimony/pdf/20100204.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicious activity requires a financial institution to submit a [[suspicious activity report]] to FinCEN. The term 'Senior Foreign Political Figure', as defined by section 312 of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] is to a great extent similar to the definition of PEP, and also excludes middle-ranking or more junior individuals.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The term PEP is recognized (and was defined) by the 'Wolfsberg Group' of eleven global banks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/pdf/faq/Wolfsberg_PEP_FAQs_(2008).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The designation "politically exposed person" dates back to the late 1990s, in what was known as the "Abacha Affair." [[Sani Abacha]] was a Nigerian dictator who organized a large scale, systematic theft of assets from the Nigerian central bank for some years with his family members and associates. It is believed that several billion dollars were stolen, and that the funds were transferred to bank accounts in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="senat.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/ue/pac/E2734.html|date=30 June 2004|title=Proposition de directive du Parlement européen et du Conseil relative à la prévention de l'utilisation du système financier aux fins du blanchiment de capitaux, y compris le financement du terrorisme|language=French|author=French Senate,Justice et affaires intérieures|publisher=French Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Nigerian Government that succeeded the Abacha Regime made an effort to recover the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200108080222.html|title=Nigeria: Abacha Loot: Swiss Govt to Dock 60 Bankers, Lawyers|first=Chidi|last='Uzor|date=8 August 2001|publisher=|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lodged complaints with several European agencies, including the [[Federal Office of Police]] of [[Switzerland]] which investigated close to sixty Swiss banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=en&amp;msg-id=22828|title=Switzerland provides mutual legal assistance in the Abacha case - To date, USD 645 million have been frozen in Switzerland|author=|date=21 January 2000|publisher=Federal Office of Justice Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this investigation, the concept of "politically exposed person" emerged, around which the UN organised a committee in December 2000, that eventually led to the October 2003 resolution of [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], entered into force in December 2005, with ongoing annual reviews of implementation and asset recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention against Corruption|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html#UNCACfulltext|publisher=UN office of drugs and crime (UNODC)|accessdate=12 February 2015|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had become [[European Union law]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="senat.fr"/&gt;

PEP-specific compliance legislation addresses the link between [[government corruption]], [[money laundering]] and [[terrorism financing]].&lt;ref name="FATF Guidance"&gt;{{cite web|title=FATF Guidance on PEP Legislation.|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Guidance-PEP-Rec12-22.pdf|publisher=FATF|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 11, 2001, more than 100 countries have changed their laws related to financial services regulation, combating political corruption.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Heavy fines have been imposed on financial institutions for conducting business with PEPs without following adequate procedures, as in the case of [[Riggs Bank]].&lt;ref name="Riggs Bank"&gt;{{cite web|title=At Riggs Bank, A Tangled Path Led to Scandal.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/19/us/at-riggs-bank-a-tangled-path-led-to-scandal.html|publisher=New York Times|date=19 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of regulation, political leaders like [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]] have made news in 2013 for having frozen assets in US banks that did not follow [[due diligence]].&lt;ref name="Mubarak Asset Freeze"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frozen Mubarak assets worth around $1bn.|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/04/17/efsa-frozen-mubarak-assets-worth-around-1bn/|publisher=Daily News Egypt|date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk screening and PEP datasets==
Most financial institutions view a PEP as a potential compliance risk, and perform enhanced monitoring of accounts that fall within this category. Screening for PEPs is usually performed at the beginning of account opening, called standard [[due diligence]] or [[know your customer]] (KYC). Screening of accounts periodically is performed as part of ongoing due diligence.

There are a number of companies advertising for regulatory, financial and reputational risk screening. 

Due diligence to uncover PEPs can be time consuming and requires the checking of names, dates of birth, national identification numbers and photos of clients against a reputable database of known PEPs, which usually contains over one million profiles.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} No 'official' PEP list exist. The [[CIA]] and [[United Nations|UN]] have lists of [[heads of state]]s, which fall below the PEP definitions of FATF. 

Vendors maintain their own particular database of PEPs and other high-risk customers.  

There are a number of crowd sourced lists of Politically Exposed Persons being made available utilizing public contributions. As of March 2016, Ukrainian activists has announced the launch of publicly available Register of Politically Exposed Persons – pep.org.ua, an exclusive public online database designed to help to withstand money laundering from state Ukrainian budget through international banks.

The '''North Atlantic or liberal model of media and politics''', as defined in Daniel C. Hallin and Paolo Mancini's ''[[Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics]]'', is characterized by an early development of commercial press, information-oriented journalism, strong professionalization, and a market dominated [[Mass media|media]] system.

==Newspaper industry==
The newspaper industry within the liberal model is characterized by [[newspaper]] circulation and the early development of mass-circulation commercial press. The first instances of newspapers appearing in the west is during the 17th century in Europe with the first instance of what we would call a newspaper appearing in Germany. This paper was called the ''Strasbourg Relation''.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Johannes (2006), "Strassburg, 1605: The Origins of the Newspaper in Europe",&lt;/ref&gt; Although western civilization was not the first to invent the [[printing press]], it had a very early development of the media format that came from it known a "press". With the expansion of technology, commercial media quickly expanded to encompass many forms. It evolved from standard newspapers and became a part of radio, music, television, movies, and the Internet, as well as many other forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;"Mass Media". Retrieved November 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political parallelism===
[[Jonathan Hardy]] believes that [[political parallelism]], “refers to the character of links between political actors and the media and more generally the extent to which media reflects [[political divisions]].”{{sfn|Hardy|2008|p=18}} In their book, ''Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics'', Daniel C. Hallin and Paola Mancini use this term to evaluate the link between [[political parties]] and media organizations.  In the North Atlantic or liberal model, Hallin and Mancini, give a description of political parallelism in the United States, British, Irish, and Canadian media systems.  According to Hallin and Mancini the United States contains the most unbiased political parallelism compared to the previous four countries.  Hallin and Mancini express how press political partisan is virtually absent in the North Atlantic or liberal model, with the exception of Britain which poses strong press parallelism.  Hallin and Mancini insist that in the North Atlantic or liberal model there is a balance within the contents of the media in order to create neutrality within the media system.   However, Hetty van Kempen believes it is still likely that press-party parallelism will still vary within the countries of the same model.  Kempen reflects on the idea of Seymour-Ure.  Ure states, “The same social forces that find expression in a party or parties of a [[political system]] tend to find expression also through the press.”  Ure’s view illustrates that this is the reason why there is a weak political parallelism in the US and Canada.  Hallin and Mancini consider that typically in a [[multiparty system]] the press seems to coincide with strong partisanship of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Kempen, Hetty van. "Media-Party Parallelism And Its Effects: A Cross-National Comparative Study." Political Communication 24.3 (2007): 303-320. Social Sciences Full Text (H.W. Wilson).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professionalization===
According to Hallin and Mancini, the [[professionalization]] of journalism was strongly developed in the liberal countries.  The authors refer to the development of journalistic practices, which is projected in the quality of political coverage. However, later the authors continue to illustrate how many contradictions emerge in the nature and the importance of context in professionalization of journalism within the liberal systems.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, D. C.; Mancini, P (2004), Comparing media systems: Three models of media and politics, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas E. Patterson believes Hallin and Mancini’s discussion of the impact of journalism, and the influence the craft has on political influence is correct and unchallenged in the scholarly literature.  Patterson explains that a tight clutch by the media to the state, as well as political institutions, creates professionalism.  Patterson elaborates how a liberal culture will create an environment of journalistic [[autonomy]], which in turn creates professionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Patterson (2007) Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics, by Daniel C. Hallin and Paolo Mancini, Political Communication, 24:3, 329-331, DOI: 10.1080/10584600701471708&lt;/ref&gt;  Katrin Voltmer agrees that professionalization prevents dependency from outside perspective and influence to impose certain rules or norms on journalists.  However, Voltmer also explains the difficulties within the classifications of professional journalistic performance. Voltmer enlightens the challenge of trying to bridge the gap between theory and practice of professionalization.  Which Voltmer later elaborates how new and old norms, as well as new standards, of journalistic quality are finding it difficult to co-exist in finding their roles in the new democratic order.&lt;ref&gt;Voltmer, Katrin. "Comparing media systems in new democracies: East meets South meets West." Central European Journal of Communication 01 (2008): 23-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the state in media system===
Media in western countries is highly market driven, this is due to the rise of [[consumerism]] thought to be mainly caused by the rise of the middle class during the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Veblen, Thorstein (1899): The Theory of the Leisure Class: an economic study of institutions, Dover Publications, Mineola, N.Y., 1994,&lt;/ref&gt; The exception to this is strong [[public broadcasting]] in Britain and Ireland, which was, in most cases, the most common, or only, form of broadcasting. Since then, however, [[commercial broadcasting]] dominates most European countries. Government still plays a role in commercial broadcasting however. For instance newspaper subsidies go back to the 1970s and now exist in Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Public broadcasters, even in Europe, often face pressure from commercial broadcasting to compete by trying to appeal to larger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Usher, Nikki. "Funding public media: How the US compares to the rest of the world" (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''transparency report''' is a statement issued on a regular basis by a [[company]], disclosing a variety of [[statistics]] related to requests for user [[data]], records, or content. Transparency reports generally disclose how frequently and under what authority [[government]]s have requested or demanded data or records over a certain period of time. This form of [[corporate transparency]] allows the public to discern what private information governments have gained access to through [[search warrant]]s and court [[subpoena]]s, among other methods. Some transparency reports describe how often, as a result of government action or under [[copyright]] provisions, content was removed. Disclosing a transparency report also helps people to know about the appropriate scope and authority of content regulation for online discussions.&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite web|title=transparency report introduction|url=https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Google]] first launched a transparency report in 2010, with [[Twitter]] following in 2012. Additional companies began releasing transparency reports as during the aftermath of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures beginning in 2013]], and the number of companies issuing them has increased rapidly ever since. Transparency reports are issued today by a variety of technology and communications companies, including [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Verizon]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[Twitter]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Facebook]], [[Yahoo]] and [[CloudFlare]]. Several companies and advocacy groups have lobbied the [[U.S. government]] to allow the number of secret data requests (requests which include a [[gag order]]s - including [[National Security Letter]]s) to be described within ranges in the report.

==Government demand increases in years==

===Google===
[[Google Search|Google's]] latest ''(10th)'' transparency report indicates that the government demands for data are increasing in recent years. This report shows demands from government in the first six months of 2014, and the firm said that it includes demands made under the US Foreign Intelligence, Surveillance Act (FISA) and through National Security Letters (NSLs).
"FISA and NSL demands have increased by 15 percent during the six months, according to the firm, and by 150 percent over the 10 reports and the five year reporting period. That's globally. In the US the figures for the same period are 19 percent and 250 percent."
[[Google]] legal director ''Richard Salgado'' accepted that the government has to fight crime and deal with threats, but the opposition of data demands need to be considered as well.
''"This increase in government demands comes against a backdrop of ongoing revelations about government surveillance programs. Despite these revelations, we have seen some countries expand their surveillance authorities in an attempt to reach service providers outside their borders,"'' he said.
''"Governments have a legitimate and important role in fighting crime and investigating national security threats. To maintain public confidence in both government and technology, we need legislative reform that ensures surveillance powers are transparent, reasonably scoped by law, and subject to independent oversight."''
The report shows that the US makes the most demands for Google users' data, and Google said that it made 12,539 requests that affected some 22,000 accounts. It added that it provided data in 84 percent of cases.

In the UK it said there were 1,535 requests covering 1,991 users or accounts, and [[Google]] provided data for 72 percent of the requests.&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dave|first1=Neal|title=Google’s 10th transparency report shows government requests are rising|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2369323/google-s-10th-transparency-report-shows-government-requests-are-rising|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yahoo===
The latest Yahoo transparency report was released on 25 September 2014. The report states that 30,511 users were affected by 18,594 government data requests.,whereas 57,324 accounts were affected by 29,470 government requests.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo Government data request|url=https://transparency.yahoo.com/government-data-requests/index.htm|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both of these figures do not include those secret requests sent by the FISA court. During the last six month from ''July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013'', it received between 0 and 1998 FISA requests for user data, affecting up to 54,997 users (including national security letters). Comparing to the first sixth month from ''January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2013'', 32,997 accounts was affected. As we can see from the figures, although the total number of data request drop, the number of data request approved from the FISA court have increased significantly.
Overall, 41 percent of accounts affected by government data requests came from requests made by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo Data requests drop, but FISA stats are worrying|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/25/yahoo-transparency-report-over-30k-government-data-requests-nearly-half-from-the-u-s/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Transparency reports may be published for a variety of purposes. One purpose could be to clarify how much information governments ask for, how such requests are evaluated, and how the receiving entity chose to respond. This information may lead consumers to the conclusion that the report's publisher is more trustworthy.&lt;ref name=argument&gt;{{cite web|title=Transparency reports useful, but more info needed on 'digital searches'|url=http://www.scmagazine.com/transparency-reports-useful-but-more-info-needed-on-digital-searches/article/376751/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is some debate about what transparency reports really reveal. Some critics argue that mere quantities of requests may mislead consumers, since most entities have little control over the number of requests they receive, the breadth of the requests they receive, or even the number of requests they ultimately comply with.&lt;ref name="transparency report"&gt;{{cite web|title=what transparency report don't tell us?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-transparency-reports-dont-tell-us/282529/#disqus_thread|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] all release transparency reports, all of which list the type and number of government data requests each company receives. these reports include exact numbers and shed a bright light on government activity. The U.S. government will not, however, permit companies to report exact numbers for national security requests or the number of requests that came under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Section 702, Patriot Act Section 215, or national security letters.
Instead, they have to aggregate the numbers or provide a range. And that's even if the government permits a company to publish that data. Google may publish national security letter information, but not FISA information. Facebook may publish FISA information, but it must lump such data in with NSL information. As a result, consumers cannot see the true figure for total government data requests.
Critics of this policy, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], argue that there is no clear national security justification for blocking entities from releasing this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the transparency report is necessary in the fight for privacy|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/09/12/transparency-reports/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts between government and company==

In June 2013, [[Google]] asked the Department of Justice for permission to disclose details about the number of FISA requests it receives. As a result, [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], and [[Facebook]] followed suit immediately. However, the Department of Justice refused those requests, and they only provide the companies with a heavily redacted version of their arguments.
Here's what Google legal director Richard Salgado had to say about FISA requests:
''"We want to go even further. We believe it’s your right to know what kinds of requests and how many each government is making of us and other companies. However, the U.S. Department of Justice contends that U.S. law does not allow us to share information about some national security requests that we might receive. Specifically, the U.S. government argues that we cannot share information about the requests we receive (if any) under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But you deserve to know."''&lt;ref name=conflicts&gt;{{cite news|title=Google slams U.S. government in latest transparency report|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2063386/google-slams-u-s-government-in-latest-transparency-report.html|accessdate=22 October 2014|agency=PC WORLD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''“Our ability to speak has been restricted by laws that prohibit and even criminalize a service provider like us from disclosing the exact number of national security letters ('NSLs') and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ('FISA') court orders received - even if that number is zero.”''avian network's veep for legal Ben Lee has blogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter sues US government for right to disclose NOTHING|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/08/twitter_sues_us_government_for_right_to_disclose_nothing/|publisher=The register|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2014, [[Twitter]] announce that there will be a lawsuit against the United States government for violating its First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Transparency Report which would reveal how many national security letters (NSLs) and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) orders [[Twitter]] receives. They provided a draft of the transparency report to the Department of Justice and discussed it for months. [[Twitter]] was still unable to get the permission for allowing them to publish even a redacted version of the report from the government.
The response form FBI for its stance is that the information Twitter wants to publish "is classified and cannot be publicly released", they also said according to the framework provided on 27 January 2014, Twitter is only permitted to qualify its description of the total number of accounts affected by all national security legal process it has received but it cannot quantify that description with specific detail that goes well beyond what is allowed under the 27th Jan 2014 framework and that discloses properly classified information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI response|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/07/National-Security/Graphics/Exhibit%205%20-%2020140909%20FBI%20Letter%20to%20Twitter.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

===About the government===
The United States government announced on 30 August 2013 that a transparency report which is in its own form will be released. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper announced the change on his office's [[Tumblr]] blog. He said that the decision will come naturally after President Barack Obama ordered the declassification of as much intelligence information as possible. Total numbers for national security letters, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) business records requests, FISA one register/trap and trace requests will be stated in the transparency report.

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

A '''tribal chief''' or '''chieftain''' is the leader of a [[tribe|tribal society]] or [[chiefdom]].

==Description==
Tribal societies with [[social stratification]] under a single (or [[Diarchy|dual]]) leader emerged in the [[Neolithic]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} period out of earlier tribal structures with little stratification, and they remained prevalent throughout the [[Iron Age]].

In the case of  [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] tribal societies existing within larger colonial and post-colonial states, tribal chiefs may represent their tribe or ethnicity in a form of [[self-government]].

The most common types are the chairman of a council (usually of "[[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]s") and/or a broader [[popular assembly]] in "parliamentary" cultures, the war chief (may be an alternative or additional post in war time), the hereditary chief, and the politically dominant [[medicineman]] (in "[[theocracy|theocratic]]" cultures).

The term is usually distinct from chiefs at lower levels, such as [[village headman|village chief]] (geographically defined) or [[clan chief]] (an essentially genealogical notion). The descriptive "tribal" requires an ethno-cultural identity (racial, linguistic, religious etc.) as well as some political (representative, legislative, executive and/or judicial) expression. In certain situations, and especially in a [[Colonialism|colonial]] context, the most powerful member of either a [[confederation]] or a [[federation]] of such tribal, clan or village chiefs would be referred to as a [[paramount chief]]. This term has largely fallen out of use, however, and such personages are now often called [[king]]s.

A woman who holds a chieftaincy in her own right or who derives one from her marriage to a male chief has been referred to alternatively as a '''chieftainess''', a '''chieftess''' or, especially in the case of the former, a '''chief'''.

==History==
[[File:Arminius1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arminius]], a chieftain of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Cherusci]] tribe who defeated three [[Roman legions]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]].]]
Anthropologist [[Elman Service]] distinguishes two stages of tribal societies: simple societies organized by limited instances of social rank and prestige, and more stratified societies led by chieftains or tribal kings ([[chiefdom]]s). Historically, tribal societies represent an intermediate stage between the [[band society]] of the [[Paleolithic]] stage and [[civilization]] with centralized, super-regional government based in [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|cities]]. Stratified tribal societies led by tribal kings thus flourished from the [[Neolithic]] stage into the [[Iron Age]], albeit in competition with [[Urban area|urban]] civilisations and [[empire]]s beginning in the [[Bronze Age]]. 
An important source of information for tribal societies of the Iron Age is [[Greco-Roman ethnography]], which describes tribal societies surrounding the urban, imperialist civilisation of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman era|Roman]] periods.

After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, tribal kingdoms were again established over much of Europe in the wake of the [[Migration period]] but they quickly turned into [[nobility]]-based [[feudalism]] afterwards. By the [[High Middle Ages]], these had again coalesced into super-regional monarchies.

Tribal societies remained prevalent in much of the [[New World]]. Exceptions to tribal societies outside of Europe and Asia were Paleolithic or Mesolithic band societies in [[Oceania]] and in parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Europeans forced centralized governments onto these societies during [[colonialism]], but in some instances tribes have retained or regained partial self-government and their lifestyles.

==Modern states or regions providing an organized form of tribal chiefships==

===Arabia===
Arabs, in particular peninsular [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabs]], nomadic Bedouins and many Iraqis and Syrians, are largely organized in tribes, many of whom have official representatives in governments. Tribal chiefs are known as [[Sheikh]]s, though this term is also sometimes applied as an honorific title to spiritual leaders of Sufism.

===Bolivia===
The [[Afro-Bolivian community|Afro-Bolivian people]], a recognized ethnic constituency of Bolivia, are led by a 
[[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|king]] whose title is also recognized by the Bolivian government.

===Botswana===
In Botswana, the reigning chiefs of the various tribes are legally empowered to serve as advisers to the government as members of the [[Ntlo ya Dikgosi]], the national [[House of Chiefs]]. In addition to this, they also serve as the ex officio chairs of the tribal ''kgotlas'', meetings of all of the members of the tribes, where political and social matters are discussed.

===Canada===
{{main|band government}}
The band is the fundamental unit of governance among the [[First Nations in Canada]] (formerly called "Indians").  Most bands have elected chiefs, either directly elected by all members of the band, or indirectly by the band council, these chiefs are recognized by the Canadian state under the terms of the [[Indian Act]].  As well, there may be traditional hereditary or charismatic chiefs, who are usually not part of the Indian Act-sanctioned formal government.  There were 614 bands in Canada in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100016202/1100100016204 Frequently Asked Questions About Aboriginal Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922104948/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100016202/1100100016204 |date=2013-09-22 }}. Aadnc-aandc.gc.ca (2010-09-15). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a national organization, the [[Assembly of First Nations]], which elects a "national chief" to act as spokesperson of all First Nations bands in Canada.

===Ghana===
The offices and traditional realms of the chiefs of Ghana are constitutionally protected by the republican constitution of the country. The chiefs serve as custodians of all traditional lands and the cultures of the traditional areas. They also serve as members of the Ghanaian [[National House of Chiefs]].

===Nigeria===
Although the [[Nigerian traditional rulers]] aren't mentioned in Nigeria's current [[Constitution of Nigeria|constitution]], they derive their powers from various so-called ''Chiefs laws'' and are therefore legally recognized. They usually serve as members of each federating state's [[State Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs]].

===Oceania===
The [[Solomon Islands]] have a Local Court Act which empowers chiefs to deal with crimes in their communities, thus assuring them of considerable effective authority.

===Philippines===
Apo Rodolfo Aguilar (Kudol I) serves as the chieftain of the [[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]] tribes people living in Banuang Daan and Cabugao settlements in Coron Island, Palawan, Philippines. His position is recognized by the Filipino government.

===South Africa===
Such figures as the [[king of the Zulu Nation]] and the [[Rain Queen]] are politically recognized in South Africa because they derive their status, not only from tribal custom, but also from the Traditional Leadership Clause of the country's current constitution.

===Uganda===
The pre-colonial states that existed in what is today Uganda were summarily abolished following independence from [[Great Britain]]. However, following constitutional reforms in 1993, a number of them were restored as politically neutral constituencies of the state by the government of [[Yoweri Museveni]]. Such figures as the [[Kabaka of Buganda]] and the [[Omukama of Toro]] typify the Ugandan chieftaincy class.

===United States===
{{further|Tribe (Native American)}}

====Historical cultural differences between tribes====
Generally, a tribe or nation is considered to be part of an [[ethnic group]], usually sharing cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s. 
For example, the forest-dwelling [[Chippewa]] historically built dwellings from the bark of trees, as opposed to the [[Great Plains]]-dwelling tribes, who would not have access to trees, except by trade, for example for [[lodgepole pine|lodgepole]]s. Thus, the tribes of the Great Plains might have typically dwelt in skin-covered [[tipi]]s rather than bark lodges. But some Plains tribes built their lodges of earth, as for example the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]].{{ref|FieldMuseum}} The [[Pueblo people]], meanwhile, built their dwellings of stone and earth.

====Political power in a tribe====
A chief might be considered to hold all political power, say by oratory or by example. But on the North American continent, it was historically possible to evade the political power of another by migration. The [[Mingo]]s, for example, were [[Iroquois]] who migrated further west to the sparsely populated [[Ohio Country]] during the 18th century. Two Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, [[Hiawatha]] and [[the Great Peacemaker]], formulated a [[Iroquois constitution|constitution]] for the Iroquois Confederation.

The tribes [[Indian Wars|were pacified]] by units of the United States Army in the nineteenth century, and were also subject to forced schooling in the decades afterward. Thus, it is uncommon for today's tribes to have a purely Native American cultural background, and today Native Americans are in many ways simply another ethnicity of the secular American people. Because formal education is now respected, some like [[Peter MacDonald (Navajo leader)|Peter MacDonald]], a Navajo, left their jobs in the mainstream U.S. economy to become chairpeople of their tribal councils or similar self-government institutions.

Not all tribal leaders need be men; [[Wilma Mankiller]] was a well-known Chief of the Cherokee Nation. Also, though the fount of power might be the chief, he or she is typically not free to wield power without the consent of a council of elders of some kind. For example: [[Cherokee]] men were not permitted to go to war without the consent of the council of women.

Tribal government is an official form of government in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstgov.gov/Government/State_Local/Tribal_Sites.shtml |title=A-Z Index of Tribal Governments, A &amp;#124; USA.gov |publisher=Firstgov.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is in a number of countries around the world.

Historically, the U.S. government treated tribes as seats of political power, and made treaties with the tribes as legal entities. Be that as it may, the territory of these tribes fell under the authority of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] as reservations held in trust for the tribes. Citizenship was formerly considered a tribal matter. For example, it was not until 1924 that the [[Pueblo people]] were granted U.S. citizenship, and it was not until 1948 that the Puebloans were granted the right to vote in state elections in New Mexico. In Wisconsin, the [[Menominee Nation]] has its own county [[Menominee County, Wisconsin]] with special car license plates; 87% of the county's population is Native American.

Mainstream Americans often find pride and comfort in realizing that at least part of their ethnic ancestry is Native American, although the connection is usually only sentimental and not economic or cultural. Thus, there is some political power in one's ability to claim a Native American connection (as in the [[Black Seminole]]).

====Economic power in a tribe====
Because the Nations were sovereign, with treaty rights and obligations, the Wisconsin tribes innovated [[Indian gaming]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051231031253/http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/dec05/381080.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, on-reservation gambling casinos, which have since become a [[United States dollar|US$]]14&amp;nbsp;billion industry nationwide. This has been imitated in many of the respective states that still have Native American tribes. The money that this generates has engendered some political scandal. For example, the [[Tiwa people|Tigua]] tribe, which fled their ancestral lands in New Mexico during the Pueblo revolt of 1680, and who then settled on land in [[El Paso County, Texas]], has paid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Myers |first=Lisa |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7575874 |title=4.2 million dollars in political contributions in Texas |publisher=NBC News |date=2005-04-20 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a low probable return to the tribe because of the [[Jack Abramoff]] publicity.

Many of the tribes use professional management for their money. Thus, the [[Mescalero Apache]] renovated their Inn of the Mountain Gods to include gambling as well as the previous tourism, lodging, and skiing in the older Inn.

The Navajo nation defeated bids to open casinos in 1994, but by 2004 the [[Shiprock]] casino was a ''[[fait accompli]]''.

The '''Island Chain Strategy''' is a strategy first mentioned by American foreign policy commentator [[John Foster Dulles]] in 1951 during the [[Korean War]]. It suggests surrounding the [[Soviet Union]] and [[PRC|China]] by sea.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroyuki Umetsu,  "Communist China’s entry into the Korean hostilities and a US proposal for a collective security arrangement in the Pacific offshore island chain." ''Journal of Northeast Asian Studies'' (1996) 15#2 pp: 98–118.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The island chain concept did not become a major theme in American policy, however it has become a major fixation of Chinese analysts to this day. The concept heightens Chinese fears that they will be encircled by American forces, and emphasizes the geographical and strategic importance of [[Taiwan]]. It helps shape Chinese naval options and strategies, as well as playing a role in economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;Toshi Yoshihara, "China's Vision of Its Seascape: The First Island Chain and Chinese Seapower." ''Asian Politics &amp; Policy'' (2012) 4#3 pp. 293–314. DOI: 10.1111/j.1943-0787.2012.01349.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Chinese writings, the Island Chain Strategy is divided into 3 parts, namely [[First island chain|First Island Chain]], the [[Second Island Chain]] and the [[Third Island Chain]].

== First Island Chain ==
{{Main|First island chain}}
The definition 
The First Island Chain begins at the [[Kuril Islands]], and finishes towards [[Borneo]] and the northern portion of the [[Philippines]]. It is the first chain to block [[socialism|socialist]] countries aligned with the USSR, and after Soviet Russia is dealt with the chain would then turn its focus on China. The key part of the first chain would be [[Taiwan]].

Because the island chain is built up of a series of landmasses, it is also called the "[[unsinkable aircraft carrier]]", especially in reference to Taiwan.

== Second Island Chain ==
The Second Island Chain can refer to two different interpretations, but the version most commonly used refers to the island chain which is formed by the [[Ogasawara Islands]] and [[Volcano Islands]] of Japan, in addition to [[Mariana Islands]] which is United States territory.

As it is located within the middle portion of the Pacific Ocean, it acts as a second strategic defense line for the United States.

==Third Island Chain ==
The Third Island Chain is the final part of the strategy. Its island chain begins at the [[Aleutian Islands]], and finishes up in [[Oceania]]. The key part of the Third Island Chain would be the [[Hawaiian Islands]] of the United States.

== Target and events ==
The primary target of the doctrine was the USSR; however, additional targets also included the People's Republic of China and Vietnam. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR collapsed]] in 1991, China soon became the major target of the doctrine.

In [[politics]], a politician is said to '''cross the floor''' if they change their party allegiance. Crossing the floor may mean changing to a second party after being elected as a member of a first party, or voting against the approved party lines.  

Voting against party lines may lead to consequences such as losing a position (e.g., as minister or a portfolio critic) or being ejected from the party caucus. While these practices are legally permissible in most countries, crossing the floor can lead to controversy and media attention. Some countries like [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/What-the-Anti-Defection-Law-says/article15777794.ece|title=What the Anti-Defection Law says|last=Venkatesan|first=J.|date=2010-10-12|work=The Hindu|access-date=2019-03-27|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Maldives]] and [[Bangladesh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/act-367/section-24624.html |title= Article 70(b) of Constitution of People's Republic of Bangladesh}}&lt;/ref&gt; have laws that remove a member from parliament due to floor-crossing.

==Etymology==
The term originates from the [[British House of Commons]], which is configured with the Government and [[Parliamentary Opposition|Opposition]] facing each other on rows of benches. In consequence, an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] who switches from the governing party to one in opposition (or vice versa) also changes which side of the chamber they sit on. A notable example of this is [[Winston Churchill]], who crossed the floor from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] to the [[Liberal party (UK)|Liberals]] in 1904, later crossing back in 1924. The term has passed into general use in other [[Westminster System|Westminster]] parliamentary democracies even if many of these countries have semicircular or horseshoe-shaped debating chambers and mechanisms for voting without [[Members of Parliament]] leaving their seats. 

== Changing parties ==
In the United Kingdom and Canada, crossing the floor means leaving one's party entirely and joining another caucus. For example, leaving an opposition party to support the government (or vice versa), leaving or being expelled from the party one ran with at election and sitting as a clear&lt;ref group=note&gt;Independents are MPs who are not members of any party recognized in the House, which may happen for a range of reasons. The House may have a minimum threshold caucus size for party recognition (distinct from the Electoral oversight body), so if only one or two politicians are elected from a minor party their party is not accorded status and they are treated as independents. Another reason could relate to e.g. the death of a party’s candidate after ballots were printed but before polling began, so alternate candidate runs independently but pledging to "take the whip" of party X. These examples are not "clearly" independent MPs, unlike someone who resigns from party Y declaring they can no longer in principle remain with it, or someone who ran and was elected on a platform against all the existing parties.&lt;/ref&gt; independent, or even leaving one opposition party to join another. In both countries, the term carries only this meaning, not simply voting against the party line on a bill.

In April 2006, Premier [[Gary Doer]] and leader the [[New Democratic Party of Manitoba]] proposed banning crossing the floor in the Manitoba legislature in response to "the concern some voters have expressed over the high-profile defections of three federal MPs from their parties in just over two years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/reddeer/story.html?id=3d05619e-313e-4cce-a7a2-f5beed56b228&amp;k=3864|title=Proposed reforms would ban floor-crossing in Man.|last=Macafee|first=Michelle|date=April 11, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323022203/http://www.canada.com/cityguides/reddeer/story.html?id=3d05619e-313e-4cce-a7a2-f5beed56b228&amp;k=3864|archivedate=March 23, 2007|publisher=Canadian Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting legislation, which amended the provincial ''Legislative Assembly Act'', mandated that members of the legislature who quit (or are expelled from) their political party must serve out the remainder of their term as independents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/2006/c01506ee.php|title=The Elections Reform Act - Schedule E|year=2006|work=Statutes of Manitoba|publisher=Manitoba Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An extraordinary example occurred in Alberta, Canada, in December 2014 by [[Danielle Smith]], the Leader of the Official Opposition. She and eight of her MLAs, all of the [[Wildrose Party]], crossed the floor together to join the governing [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;http://globalnews.ca/news/1737886/danielle-smiths-move-to-pcs-unprecedented/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2019, eleven [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|British MPs]] defected from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties to form the centrist [[Change UK]] party, due to the [[Euroscepticism]] of the parties, and in the case of Labour, [[Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party|allegations of anti-semitism]]. In September 2019, the governing Conservative party lost its working majority when [[Phillip Lee (politician)|Phillip Lee MP]] defected to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] during the first speech of new prime minister [[Boris Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49570682|title=Tory MP defects ahead of crucial Brexit vote|date=2019-09-03|access-date=2019-09-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voting against party lines==
In some countries, the phrase "crossing the floor" describes members of a government party or parties who defect by voting with the opposition against some piece of government-sponsored legislation. Political parties commonly allow their members a free vote on some matters of personal conscience. In Australia, one of the major parties, the [[Australian Labor Party]] requires its members to pledge their support for the collective decisions of the caucus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22library%2Fprspub%2F31KH6%22 |title=Crossing the floor in the Federal Parliament 1950 – August 2004 |work=Research Note no. 11 2005–06 |publisher=Australian Parliament |date=October 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which theoretically prohibits them from "crossing the floor" in this sense; however, in practice, some Labor members disregard this pledge, despite the disciplinary action which may result. Among other parties, crossing the floor is rare, although then Senator [[Barnaby Joyce]] of the [[National Party of Australia]] crossed the floor 19 times under the Howard coalition government.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Debelle, [http://www.theage.com.au/national/independently-inclined-20080530-2jzv.html?page=2 Independently inclined] in ''The Age'' dated May 31, 2008, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Tasmanian Senator [[Reg Wright|Sir Reg Wright]], voted against his own party, the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], on 150 occasions, which has been claimed as a record for this form of crossing the floor in the Australian Parliament.

In the United States, the phrase '''testing the waters''' is used to describe someone who is exploring the feasibility of becoming a candidate for political office.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/rad/candidates/documents/CanGuideTestWater_000.pdf |accessdate=July 2, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703075138/http://www.fec.gov/rad/candidates/documents/CanGuideTestWater_000.pdf |archivedate=July 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/24/campaign-finance-law-2016_n_6932834.html |title='Testing The Waters': The Unseen Significance Of A Candidate Cliche |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Testing the waters" activities are to be paid for with candidate-permissible funds.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; Once an individual begins to campaign or decides to become a candidate, funds that were raised or spent to "test the waters" apply to the $5,000 threshold for qualifying as a candidate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; This is because there is a [[federal law]] that once an individual raises or spends $5,000 for a campaign, they are required to register as a [[federal candidate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patch.com/illinois/deerfield/nancy-rotering-accused-violating-federal-campaign-law-0 |title=Nancy Rotering Accused of Violating Federal Campaign Law By Conservative Group &amp;#124; Deerfield, IL Patch |publisher=Patch.com |date=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once that threshold is exceeded, the individual must register with the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) (candidates for the [[United States House of Representatives]]) or the [[Secretary of the Senate]] (candidates for the [[United States Senate]]), and begin to file reports (including in the first report all activity that occurred prior to reaching the $5,000 threshold).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Once an individual registers as a federal candidate, election restrictions apply, including 2,700 dollars on contributions.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/us/politics/jeb-bush-taking-his-time-tests-the-legal-definition-of-candidate.html|title=Jeb Bush, Taking His Time, Tests the Legal Definition of Candidate|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, once registered as a candidate, individuals cannot coordinate with [[political action committee]]s (PACs) or [[Super PAC]]s under [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign finance law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bush-eyes-new-role-for-his-super-pac-during-2016-campaign/ |title=Jeb Bush eyes new role for his super PAC during 2016 campaign |date=April 21, 2015 |accessdate=June 15, 2015 |publisher=Cbsnews.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting on "testing the waters"==
On July 1st, it was reported that Nancy Rotering allegedly received donations for her congressional campaign in excess of $5,000 as early as January and did not officially register as a candidate with the FEC until March.

On June 18, 2015, it was reported that [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] had formed a "testing the waters" committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lovelace |first=Ryan |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/scott-walker-forms-a-testing-the-waters-committee/article/2566521 |title=Scott Walker forms a 'testing the waters' committee |publisher=Washington Examiner |date=2015-06-18 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2015, it as reported that the [[Campaign Legal Center]], a nonpartisan legal organization, filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission against Democrat [[Martin O’Malley]] and Republicans Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum and Scott Walker alleging violations of federal law “testing the waters.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/campaign/243828-republican-fec-commissioner-admittedly-blocking-complaints |title=Republican FEC commissioner admittedly blocking complaints against Republicans |publisher=TheHill |date=2015-06-04 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2015, it was reported that as of June 3, [[Jeb Bush]] was still "testing the waters", and had not registered as a federal candidate.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

On April 9, 2015, it was reported that [[Rick Santorum]] set up a "testing the waters" account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/9/rick-santorum-sets-testing-waters-account-ahead-po/ |title=Rick Santorum sets up 'testing the waters' account ahead of possible 2016 W.H. bid |publisher=Washington Times |date= |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="23945" xml:space="preserve">'''New Public Management''' ('''NPM''') is an approach to running [[public service]] organizations that is used in government and public service institutions and agencies, at both sub-national and national levels. The term was first introduced by academics in the UK and Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hood |first1=Christopher |date=1 March 1991 |title=A Public Management for all Seasons? |journal=Public Administration |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=3-19 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9299.1991.tb00779.x}} and Hood and Jackson 1991&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|reason=titles??|date=December 2018}} to describe approaches that were developed during the 1980s as part of an effort to make the public service more "businesslike" and to improve its efficiency by using private sector management models. 

As with the private sector, which focuses on "[[customer service]]", NPM reforms often focused on the "centrality of citizens who were the recipient of the services or customers to the public sector".&lt;ref name="studyguide"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.managementstudyguide.com/new-public-management.htm | title=New Public Management Model}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPM reformers experimented with using decentralized service delivery models, to give local agencies more freedom in how they delivered programs or services. In some cases, NPM reforms that used [[e-government]] consolidated a program or service to a central location to reduce costs. Some governments tried using [[quasi-market]] structures, so that the public sector would have to compete against the private sector (notably in the UK, in [[health care]]).&lt;ref name="studyguide" /&gt; Key themes in NPM were "financial control, value for money, increasing efficiency&amp;nbsp;..., identifying and setting targets and continuance monitoring of performance, handing over&amp;nbsp;... power to the senior management" [[Senior management|executives]]. Performance was assessed with audits, benchmarks and performance evaluations. Some NPM reforms used private sector companies to deliver what were formerly public services.&lt;ref name="studyguide" /&gt; 

NPM advocates in some countries worked to remove "collective agreements [in favour of]&amp;nbsp;... individual rewards packages at senior levels combined with short term contracts" and introduce private sector-style [[corporate governance]], including using a [[Board of Directors]] approach to strategic guidance for public organizations.&lt;ref name="studyguide"/&gt; While NPM approaches have been used in many countries around the world, NPM is particularly associated with the most industrialized [[OECD]] nations such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States of America]]. NPM advocates focus on using approaches from the private sector – the [[corporation|corporate]] or business world–which can be successfully applied in the public sector and in a [[public administration]] context. NPM approaches have been used to reform the public sector, its policies and its programs. NPM advocates claim that it is a more efficient and effective means of attaining the same outcome. 

In NPM, citizens are viewed as "customers" and public servants are viewed as public managers. NPM tries to realign the relationship between public service managers and their political superiors by making a parallel relationship between the two. Under NPM, public managers have incentive-based motivation such as pay-for-performance, and clear performance targets are often set, which are assessed by using [[performance evaluation]]s. As well, managers in an NPM paradigm may have greater discretion and freedom as to how they go about achieving the goals set for them. This NPM approach is contrasted with the traditional [[public administration]] model, in which institutional decision-making, policy-making and public service delivery is guided by regulations, legislation and [[administrative law|administrative procedures]]. 

NPM reforms use approaches such as disaggregation, customer satisfaction initiatives, [[customer service]] efforts, applying an [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial spirit]] to public service, and [[innovation|introducing innovations]]. The NPM system allows "the expert manager to have a greater discretion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance, and Public Administration|date=February 2, 2006|pages=888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barzelay|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|url=https://archive.org/details/newpublicmanagem00barz|url-access=registration|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Public Managers under the New Public Management reforms can provide a range of choices from which customers can choose, including the right to opt out of the service delivery system completely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first practices of New Public Management emerged in the United Kingdom under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Thatcher played the functional role of “policy entrepreneur" and the official role of prime minister.{{fact|date=November 2016}} Thatcher drove changes in public management policy in such areas as organizational methods, civil service, labor relations, expenditure planning, financial management, audit, evaluation, and procurement. 

Thatcher's successor, [[John Major]], kept public management policy on the agenda of the Conservative government, leading to the implementation of the Next Steps Initiative. Major also launched the programs of the Citizens Charter Initiative, Competing for Quality, Resource Accounting and Budgeting, and the Private Finance Initiative.

A term was coined in the late 1980s to denote a new (or renewed) focus on the importance of management and ‘production engineering’ in public service delivery, which often linked to doctrines of economic rationalism (Hood 1989, Pollitt 1993). During this timeframe public management became an active area of policy-making in numerous other countries, notably in New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden.  At the same time, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ]] (OECD) established its Public Management Committee and Secretariat (PUMA), conferring to public management the status normally accorded more conventional domains of policy. In the 1990s, public management was a major item on President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]’s agenda. Early policy actions of the Clinton administration included launching the [[National Partnership for Reinventing Government|National Partnership]] and signing into law the [[Government Performance and Results Act]]. Currently there are few indications that public management issues will vanish from governmental policy agendas. A recent study showed that in Italy, municipal directors are aware of a public administration now being oriented toward new public management where they are assessed according to the results they produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marozzi|first1=Marco|last2=Bolzan|first2=Mario|title=Skills and training requirements of municipal directors: A statistical assessment|journal=Quality and Quantity|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1093–1115|date=2015|doi=10.1007/s11135-015-0192-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term New Public Management (NPM) expresses the idea that the cumulative flow of policy decisions over the past twenty years has amounted to a substantial shift in the governance and management of the “state sector” in the [[United Kingdom]], [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Scandinavia]], [[North America]], and [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;Morisson, A. &amp; Doussineau, M. (2019). Regional innovation governance and place-based policies: design, implementation and implications. Regional Studies, Regional Science,6(1),101–116. https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21681376.2019.1578257.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[regional innovation agency]] were created under NPM principles to support the innovation process.&lt;ref&gt;Morisson, A. &amp; Doussineau, M. (2019). Regional innovation governance and place-based policies: design, implementation and implications. Regional Studies, Regional Science,6(1),101–116. https://rsa.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21681376.2019.1578257.&lt;/ref&gt;  A benign interpretation is that these decisions have been a defensible, if imperfect, response to policy problems. Those problems as well as their solutions were formulated within the policy-making process. The agenda-setting process has been heavily influenced by electoral commitments to improve macro- economic performance and to contain growth in the public sector, as well as by a growing perception of public bureaucracies as being inefficient. The alternative-generation process has been heavily influenced by ideas coming from economics and from various quarters within the field of management.

== Globalization ==
Although the origins of NPM came from Westernized countries it expanded to a variety of other countries in the 1990s. Before the 1990s, NPM was largely associated to an idea utilized by developed countries that are particularly Anglo-Saxon. However the 1990s have seen countries in Africa, Asia and other countries looking into using this method. In Africa, downsizing and decrease of user fees have been widely introduced. These autonomous agencies within the public sectors have been established in these areas. Performance contracting became a common policy in crisis states worldwide. Contracting out of this magnitude can be used to do things such as waste management, cleaning, laundry, catering and road maintenance.

== Aspects  ==

NPM was accepted as the "gold standard for administrative reform"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farazmand|first1=Ali|title=New Public Management: Theory, Ideology, and Practice|journal=Handbook of Globalization, Governance and Public Administration|date=Jan 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1990s. The idea for using this method for government reform was that if the government guided private-sector principles were used rather than rigid hierarchical bureaucracy, it would work more efficiently. NPM promotes a shift from bureaucratic administration to business-like professional management. NPM was cited as the solution for management ills in various organizational context and policy making in education and health care reform.

The basic principles of NPM is can best be described when split into seven different aspects elaborated by Christopher Hood in 1991. Hood also invented the term NPM itself. &lt;ref&gt;in "A Public Management for all seasons?", Public Administration Review, Voæl 69, Spring1991 (3-19).&lt;/ref&gt; They are the following:

=== Management ===
Because of its belief in the importance and strength of privatizing government, it is critical to have an emphasis on management by engaging in hands-on methods. This theory allows leaders the freedom to manage freely and open up discretion.

=== Performance standards ===
Its important to maintain explicit standards and measures of performance in a workforce. Using this method promotes clarification of goals/intent, targets, and indicators for progression.

=== Output controls ===
The third point acknowledges the "shift from the use of input controls and bureaucratic procedures to rules relying on output controls measured by quantitive performance indicators".&lt;ref&gt;Yamaoto, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect requires using performance based assessments when looking to outsource work to private companies/groups.

=== Decentralization ===
NPM advocates often shifted from a unified management system to a decentralized system in which managers gain flexibility and are not limited to agency restrictions.

=== Competition ===
This characteristic focuses on how NPM can promote competition in the public sector which could in turn lower cost, eliminate debate and possibly achieve a higher quality of progress/work through the term contacts. Competition can also be found when the government offers contracts to the private sectors and the contract is given in terms of the ability to deliver the service effectively, quality of the goods provided, hence this will increase competition because the other private sector which did not get the contract will make strides to improve the quality and ability thereby facilitating competition.

=== Private-sector management ===
This aspect focuses on the necessity to establish short-term labor contracts, develop corporate plans or [[business plan]]s, performance agreements and [[mission statement]]s. It also focuses on establishing a workplace in which public employees or contractors are aware of the goals and intention that agencies are trying to reach.

=== Cost reduction ===
The most effective one which has led to its ascent into global popularity, focuses on keeping cost low and efficiency high. "Doing more with less" &lt;ref&gt;Hood, 1991: 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;
moreover cost reduction stimulates efficiency and is one way which makes it different from the traditional approach of management&lt;ref&gt;Deffy, 1999:67-78&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences between public and private sectors ==
New Public Management draws practices from the private sector and uses them in the public sector of management. NPM reforms use market forces to hold the public sector accountable and the satisfaction of preferences as the measures of accountability.  In order for this system to proceed, certain conditions, such as the existence of competition, must exist and information about choices must be available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaboolian|first1=Linda|title=The New Public Management: Challenging the Boundaries of the Management vs. Administration Debate|date=1998|publisher=Public Administration Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reforms that promise to reinvent government by way of focusing on results and customer satisfaction as opposed to administrative and political processes fail to account for legislative self-interest. Institutions other than federal government, the changes being trumpeted as reinvention would not even be announced, except perhaps on hallway bulletin boards.

== Issues ==

===Criticisms===
There are blurred lines between policymaking and providing services in the New Public Management system. Questions have been raised about the potential politicization of the public service, when executives are hired on contract under pay-for-performance systems. The ability for citizens to effectively choose the appropriate government services they need has also been challenged. "The notion of choice is essential to the economic concept of a customer. Generally, in government there are few if any choices." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Public Service: Serving, Not Steering|last=Denhardt &amp; Denhardt|first=|publisher=M.E. Sharp|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7656-2625-7|location=Armonk, New York|pages=25-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are concerns that public managers move away from trying to meet citizens' needs and limitations on accountability to the public&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Public Management: Improving Research and Policy Dialogue|url=https://archive.org/details/newpublicmanagem00barz|url-access=registration|last1=Barzelay|date=2001|publisher=Russell Sage Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  NPM brings to question integrity and compliance when dealing with incentives for public managers - the interests of customers and owners do not always align.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Questions such as managers being more or less faithful arise. The public interest is at risk and could undermine the trust in government. "Government must be accountable to the larger public interest, not only to individual immediate customers or consumers [of government services.]"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Relevance  ====

Although NPM had a dramatic impact in the 1990s on managing and policymaking, many scholars believe that NPM has hit its prime. Scholars like Frank Dunleavy believe New Public Management is phasing out because of disconnect with “customers” and their institutions. Scholars cite the Digital Era and the new importance of technology that kills the necessity of NPM. In countries that are less industrialized the NPM concept is still growing and spreading. This trend has much to do with a country's ability or inability to get their public sector in tune with the Digital Era. New Public Management was created in the Public Sector to create change based on: disaggregation, competition, and incentives. Using incentives to produce the maximum services from an organization is largely stalled in many countries and being reversed because of increased complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives===
Post-NPM, many countries explored [[digital era governance]] (DEG). Dunleavy believes this new way of governance should be heavily centered upon information and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunleavy|title=New Public Management Is Dead--Long Live Digital-Era Governance|date=2005|publisher=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology will help re-integrate with digitalization changes. Digital Era Governance provides a unique opportunity for self- sustainability however, there are various factors that will determine whether or not DEG can be implemented successfully. When countries have proper technology, NPM simply can't compete very well with DEG. DEG does an excellent job of making services more accurate, prompt and remove most barriers and conflicts. DEG also can improve the service quality and provide local access to outsourcers.

The New Public Service is a newly developed theory for 21st century citizen-focused public administration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This work directly challenges the clientelism and rationalist paradigm of the New Public Management. New Public Service (NPS) focuses on democratic governance and re-imagining the accountability of public administrators toward citizens. NPS posits that administrators should be a broker between citizens and their government, focusing on citizen engagement in political and administrative issues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Comparisons to [[New Public Administration]]===

New Public Management is often mistakenly compared to [[New Public Administration]]. The ‘New Public Administration’ movement was one established in the USA during the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pfiffner|first1=James|title=Public Administration versus The New Public Management|url=http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Book_Chapters/NewPublicMgt.doc.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there may be some common features, the central themes of the two movements are different. The main thrust of the New Public Administration movement was to bring academic public administration into line with an anti-hierarchical egalitarian&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toward a New Public Administration [In Shafritz &amp; Hyde (eds). Classics of Public Administration]|last=Fredrickson|first=H. George|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2004|isbn=978-1-111-34274-6|location=Boston, MA|pages=294-305}}&lt;/ref&gt; movement that was influential in US university campuses and public sector workers. By contrast, the emphasis of the New Public Management movement a decade or so later was firmly managerial normative in that it stressed the difference that management could and should make in the quality and efficiency of public services. It focuses on public service production functions and operational issues contrasted with the focus on public accountability, ‘model employer’ public service values, ‘due process,’ and what happens inside public organizations in conventional public administration.

'''Punk ideologies''' are a group of varied social and political beliefs associated with the [[punk subculture]] and [[punk rock]]. In its original incarnation, the punk subculture originated out of working class angst and the frustrations many youth were feeling about economic inequality and the bourgeois hypocrisy and neglect of working people and their struggles.  It was primarily concerned with concepts such as [[mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Anthony Avery-Natale|authorlink=Edward Anthony Avery-Natale|title=Ethics, Politics, and Anarcho-Punk Identifications: Punk and Anarchy in Philadelphia|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=1498519997|page=50|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=yrWRCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6z6nv7oXgAhUOcCsKHchsA44Q6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 January 2019|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; against [[selling out]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Erik Hannerz|authorlink=Erik Hannerz|title=Performing Punk|publisher=Springer|isbn=1137485922|page=|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_ZRMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT139&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2rKDWsYzgAhVZFHIKHZLtDTgQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 January 2019|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[egalitarianism]], [[humanitarianism]], [[anti-authoritarianism]],&lt;ref name=ContestingSubculturalBoundaries&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirsty Lohman|authorlink=Kirsty Lohman|title=The Connected Lives of Dutch Punks: Contesting Subcultural Boundaries|publisher=Springer|isbn=3319510797|page=150|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cHg5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwibyqKEk4zgAhXGV30KHT5hAi4Q6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 January 2019|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[anti-consumerism]],&lt;ref name=ContestingSubculturalBoundaries/&gt; [[anti-corporatism]], [[anti-war]], [[decolonization]], [[conservatism|anti-conservatism]], [[anti-liberalism]], [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]], [[anti-gentrification protests|anti-gentrification]], [[anti-racism]], anti-[[sexism]], [[gender equality]], [[racial equality]], [[right to health|health rights]], [[civil rights]], [[animal rights]], [[disability rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Music and Disability Studies|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199331448|page=240|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=TJWFCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA240&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOo66MnozgAhUUfn0KHTj-BOQQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage%20punk&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 January 2019|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[free-thought]] and [[non-conformity]]. One of its main tenets was a rejection of mainstream, corporate [[mass culture]] and its values.  It continued to evolve its ideology as the movement spread throughout North America from its origins in England and New York and embrace a range of anti-racist and anti-sexist belief systems. Punk ideologies range from [[left wing]] views (e.g., [[NOFX]]) to [[right wing]] beliefs (e.g., [[Fear (band)|Fear]]) or [[apolitical]] (e.g., [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]]).

Punk ideologies are usually expressed through [[punk rock]] music and lyrics, [[punk literature]] such as amateur [[fanzines]], [[spoken word]] performances or recordings, [[punk fashion]], or [[punk visual art]]. Some punks have participated in [[direct action]], such as protest or demonstration disruption, political violence, [[ecotage]], street barricades, [[squatting]], [[pirate radio]], [[off-grid energy]], [[graffiti]], [[vandalism]] and public and business [[property destruction]]. Indirect action through counter-propaganda, [[protest]]s or [[boycott]]s. They support and squat in urban and rural collective houses with held group funds in common. [[Punk fashion]] was originally an expression of nonconformity, as well as opposition to both mainstream culture and the [[status quo]]. Punk fashion often displays aggression, rebellion, and individualism. Some punks wear accessories, clothing or have [[tattoos]] that express sociopolitical messages. They stage Punk Rock Food Drives such as D.O.A's Unity for Freedom. Punk visual art also often includes political messages. Many punks wear second-hand clothing, partly as an anti-consumerist statement.

An attitude common in the punk subculture is the opposition to [[selling out]], which refers to abandoning of one's values and/or a change in musical style toward [[Pop music|pop]] (e.g. [[electropop]]) and embracing anything in mainstream capitalist culture or more radio-friendly [[Rock music|rock]] (e.g. [[pop rock]]) in exchange for wealth, status, or power. Selling out also has the meaning of adopting a more mainstream lifestyle and ideology. The issue of [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is important in the punk subculture—the pejorative term ''[[poseur]]'' is applied to those who try to associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying core values or philosophy.

Because [[anti-establishment]] attitudes are such an important part of the punk subculture, a network of [[independent record label]]s, venues and distributors has developed. Some punk bands have chosen to break from this independent system and work within the established system of [[major label]]s. The [[do it yourself]] (DIY) ideal is common in the punk scene, especially in terms of music recording and distribution, concert promotion, and photocopying magazines, posters and flyers. The expression [[DIY]] was coined by commentators after the fact.

On religious issues, punk is mostly [[atheism|atheist]] or [[skepticism|skeptic]], but some punk bands are [[theism|theist]] and have promoted religions or spirituality such as [[Christian punk|Christianity]], [[Taqwacore|Islam]], [[Umbanda]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Neo-Paganism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Vedanta]] or [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna]].

== Specific ideologies and philosophies ==
The following include some of the most common ideologies and philosophies within the punk subculture (in alphabetical order).

=== Anarchism ===
{{Main|Anarcho-punk}}
[[File:Punk Occupy Pittsburgh protestors (6262172208).jpg|thumb|right|170px|A punk protester carries a sign including an anarchy symbol.]]
There is a complex and worldwide underground of punks committed to anarchism as a serious political ideology, sometimes termed "peace punks" or "[[anarcho-punk]]s." While some well-known punk bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]] and [[The Exploited]] had songs about [[anarchy]], notably the Pistols' "[[Anarchy in the UK]]", they did not embrace anarchism as a disciplined ideology. As such, these bands are not considered part of the anarcho-punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;Glasper, Ian (2006), ''The Day the Country Died: A History of Anarcho Punk 1980 to 1984'', Cherry Red publishing, {{ISBN|978-1-901447-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcho-punks typically believe in [[direct action]]. Many anarcho-punks are [[pacifism|pacifists]] (e.g. Crass and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]) and therefore believe in using non-violent means of achieving their aims. These include peaceful protest, [[squatting]], [[graffiti|legal graffiti]], [[culture jamming]], [[ecotage]], [[freeganism]], [[boycott]]ing, [[civil disobedience]], [[hacktivism]] and [[subvertising]]. Some anarcho-punks believe that violence or property damage is an acceptable way of achieving social change (e.g. [[Conflict (band)|Conflict]]). This manifests itself as [[riot]]ing, [[graffiti|illegal graffiti]], [[vandalism]], wire cutting, [[Hunt saboteur|hunt sabotage]], participation in [[Class War]]-style activities, [[melee weapon]]s and in extreme cases, bombings. Notable anarchist punk artists include: [[Aus-Rotten]], [[Dave Insurgent]], [[Crass]], [[Subhumans (British band)]], [[Colin Jerwood]], and [[Dave Dictor]].

=== Animal rights and veganism ===
In the 1980s, both [[straight edge]] hardcore punk in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helton|first=Jesse J.|last2=Staudenmeier|first2=William J.|year=2002|title=Re-imagining being 'straight' in straight edge|journal=Contemporary Drug Problems|volume=29|issue=2|page=465|issn=0091-4509|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Robert T.|title=Nailed to the X: A Lyrical History of Straightedge|journal=Journal of Youth Studies|year=1999|volume=2|issue=2|pages=133–151|ref=harv|doi=10.1080/13676261.1999.10593032}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name="descartes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/len-tilburger-and-chris-p-kale-nailing-descartes-to-the-wall-animal-rights-veganism-and-punk-cu|last1=Tilbürger|first1=Len|last2=Kale|first2=Chris P|title="Nailing Descartes to the Wall": Animal Rights, Veganism and Punk Culture|publisher=Active Distribution|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; became associated with [[animal rights]]. Consequently, [[vegetarianism]] and [[veganism]] became a feature of the punk subculture.&lt;ref name="descartes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haenfler|first=Ross|title=Straight Edge: Hardcore Punk, Clean Living Youth, and Social Change|year=2006|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-3851-3|ref=harv|page=53 and 427–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as [[Fluff Fest]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="sober"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=YWb7BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Sober Living for the Revolution: Hardcore Punk, Straight Edge, and Radical Politics|page=137|last=Kuhn|first=Gabriel|publisher=PM Press|date=2010|isbn=1604860510|author-link=Gabriel_Kuhn|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bandcamp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://daily.bandcamp.com/2017/09/20/czech-diy-list/|title=The Sincere and Vibrant World of the Czech DIY Scene|publisher=Bandcamp|first=Jacopo|last=Sanna|date=20 September 2017|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apoliticism ===
Some punks claim to be non-political, such as the band [[Charged GBH]] and the singer [[G.G. Allin]], although some socio-political ideas have appeared in their lyrics. Some Charged GBH songs have discussed social issues, and a few have expressed anti-war views. G.G. Allin expressed a vague desire to kill the United States president and destroy the political system in his song "Violence Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |title=The GG Allin SuperSite Lyrics - Violence Now - Assassinate The President |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2014-05-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027094628/http://geocities.com/ekx001/LYRIC/VNATP.html |archivedate=October 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punk subgenres that are generally apolitical include: [[glam punk]], [[psychobilly]], [[horror punk]], [[punk pathetique]], [[deathrock]] and [[pop punk]]. Many of the bands credited with starting the punk movement were decidedly apolitical, including [[The Dictators]], [[Ramones]] (which featured staunch [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Johnny Ramone]] alongside [[liberalism|liberal]] activist [[Joey Ramone]]), [[New York Dolls]], [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Johnny Thunders &amp; The Heartbreakers]], and [[Richard Hell &amp; The Voidoids]].

=== Christianity ===
{{main|Christian punk}}
[[Christian punk]] is a subgenre of punk rock with some degree of Christian lyrical content. Some Christian punk bands are associated with the [[Contemporary Christian music|Christian music industry]],&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/christian-punk-ma0000002639/artists|title=Christian Punk Music Artists - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others reject that association. Ideologies within Christian punk vary, though a number of bands lean towards traditional left-wing politics, most prominently [[Crashdog]], [[Ballydowse]] and [[The Psalters]], the latter two of whom identified as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bramboniusinenglish.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/the-lost-psalters-interview-from-august-11-kortrijk/ |title=The Lost Psalters Interview |date=March 14, 2012 |publisher=Brambonius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://londoncelticpunks.wordpress.com/tag/ballydowse/ |title=Tribute to Ballydowse |publisher=London Celtic Punks Web-Zine |date=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of notable Christian punk bands include [[Altar Boys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/altar-boys-mn0000793617/biography |title=Altar Boys |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Crucified]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-crucified-mn0000135837|title=The Crucified - Biography, Albums, Streaming Links - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Five Iron Frenzy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/five-iron-frenzy-mn0000178494 |title=Five Iron Frenzy |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flatfoot 56]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/flatfoot-56-mn0000921885 |title=Flatfoot 56 |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pop-punk band [[MxPx]], who earned a [[Music recording certification|gold record]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mxpx-mn0000521851 |title=MxPx |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conservatism ===
{{see also|Conservative Punk}}
A small number are [[Conservatism|conservative]], rejecting leftist-[[anarchism]], [[liberalism]], [[communism]] and [[socialism]] in favor of conservatism. Notable conservative punks include [[Johnny Ramone]], [[Dee Dee Ramone]], &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/ramones-19-1332648|title=Marky Ramone: 'Phil Spector didn't hold a gun to us' {{!}} NME|date=2008-12-02|website=NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs {{!}} NME.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forgotten Rebels]],  [[Billy Zoom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markprindle.com/zoom-i.htm |title=Billy Zoom interview |publisher=Markprindle.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Escalante]], [[Bobby Steele]], [[Duane Peters]] and [[Dave Smalley]]. Some [[Christian punk]] and hardcore bands have [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political stances, in particular some of the [[New York hardcore|NYHC]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McPheeters |first=Sam |url=https://www.vice.com/read/survival-of-the-streets-137-v16n9 |title=Survival Of The Streets &amp;#124; VICE United States |publisher=Vice.com |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hare Krishna ===
{{Further|Krishnacore}}
The Filipino punk band the [[Krishnacore|Wuds]] which was formed in the early 1980s is the first known punk band who composed songs dedicated to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wuds-mn0001790200&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some notable members of the [[New York hardcore]] scene, including [[Ray Cappo]] ([[Youth of Today]], [[Shelter (band)|Shelter]] and other bands), [[John Joseph (singer)|John Joseph]] ([[Cro-Mags]]) and [[Harley Flanagan]] (Cro-Mags) converted to [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823161134/http://www.punkbands.com/reviews.php?id=661|date=August 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to trend within the western hardcore scene that became known as Krishnacore.

=== Islam ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[Taqwacore]] is a punk subgenre centred on [[Islam]], its culture and its interpretation. The Taqwacore scene is composed mainly of young Muslim artists living in the United States and other western countries, many of whom openly reject traditionalist interpretations of Islam. There is no definitive Taqwacore sound, and some bands incorporate styles including hip-hop, techno, and/or musical traditions from the Muslim world. Examples of Muslim punk bands include [[Alien Kulture]], [[The Kominas]] and [[Secret Trial Five]].

=== Liberalism ===
[[Liberalism|Liberal]] punks were in the punk subculture from the beginning, and are mostly on the [[social liberalism|liberal left]]. Notable liberal punks (second wave, mid-1990s to 2000s) include: [[Joey Ramone]], [[Fat Mike]] of [[NOFX]], [[Ted Leo]], [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] of [[Green Day]], [[Crashdog]],  [[Dropkick Murphys]], [[Hoxton Tom McCourt]], [[Jared Gomes]] of [[Hed PE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129035243/http://www.johndoerevolution.com/2010/08/hd-pe.html |archivedate=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Latest-hed-p-e-album-has-plenty-of-messages-116661.php|title=Latest (hed) p.e. album has plenty of messages|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/interviews/1025867/hedp-e|title=(Hed)p.e - Interviews - Killyourstereo.com|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218034734/http://www.ownblood-magazine.de/interviews187.htm |archivedate=2014-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Armstrong]] of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[Tim McIlrath]] of [[Rise Against]]. Some punks participated in the [[Rock Against Bush]] movement in the mid-2000s, in support of the Democratic Party candidate [[John Kerry]].

=== Libertarianism ===
Libertarian (or [[right-libertarian]]) punks advocate [[free market]] [[capitalism]], a [[Night-watchman state|minimal government]] and private ownership of property. Joe Young of the band [[Antiseen]],&lt;ref name=slug&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slugmag.com/articles/106/ANTiSEEN.html |title=SLUG Magazine &amp;#124; ANTiSEEN |publisher=Slugmag.com |date=2004-09-29 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exene Cervenka]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/24-7/2012/10/13/punk-icon-exene-cervenka-endorses-gary-j |title=Punk Icon Exene Cervenka Endorses Gary Johnson - Reason 24/7 |publisher=Reason.com |date=2012-10-13 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Krist Novoselic]] founding member of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]&lt;ref&gt;https://pitchfork.com/news/69117-watch-nirvanas-krist-novoselic-discuss-support-for-libertarian-gary-johnson-new-voting-system/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mojo Nixon]] have expressed support for libertarianism. Though originally a conservative,  [[Michale Graves]] has shifted towards libertarianism in recent years.

=== Neo-Nazism ===
{{Main|Nazi punk|White power rock|Rock Against Communism}}
[[Nazi punk]]s have a [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] ideology that is closely related to that of [[white power skinhead]]s. [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]] and his band [[Skrewdriver]] are credited with popularizing [[white power rock]] and [[hatecore]] (for its hateful lyrical themes), or [[Rock Against Communism]]. Nazi punks are different from early punks such as [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]], who are believed to have incorporated Nazi imagery such as [[Swastika]]s for shock or comedy value.

=== Nihilism ===
Centering on a belief in the abject lack of meaning and value to life, [[nihilism]] was a fixture in some early punk rock and [[protopunk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/interview-with-simon-critchley/|title=Nihilism, Punk and the International Necronautical Society: an interview with Simon Critchley -|date=30 March 2009|publisher=|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sex Pistols]] were central to the association of punk and nihilsm, with the ''Trouser Press Record Guide'' writing that their "confrontational, nihilistic public image and rabidly nihilistic socio-political lyrics set the tone that continues to guide punk bands."&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Ira, "Sex Pistols", in ''The Trouser Press Record Guide'', 4th ed., ed. Ira Robbins, p.585, Collier, 1991. {{ISBN|0-02-036361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, researcher Neil Eriksen argues that though "much of the critical realism [of punk rock] expresses cynicism and nihilism, it does serve to question existing relations in such a way that listeners are forced to think about what is being said",&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/periodicals/theoretical-review/19801802.htm|title=Popular Culture and Revolutionary Theory: Understanding Punk Rock|first=|last=EROL|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that overt rejection of meaning is primarily concerned with challenging existing values.

=== Situationism ===
[[File:DUST Flyer.jpg|thumb|Flyer for DUST happening circa. 1992]]
The [[Situationist International]] (SI) was an early influence on punk subculture in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989"&gt;Marcus, Greil, Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century, Harvard University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-571-23228-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Started in continental Europe in the 1950s, the SI was an avant-garde political movement that sought to recapture the ideals of surrealist art and use them to construct new and radical social situations. [[Malcolm McLaren]] introduced situationist ideas to punk through his management of the band [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref name="Marcus, Greil 1989" /&gt; [[Vivienne Westwood]], McLaren's partner and the band's designer/stylist, expressed situationist ideals through fashion that was intended to provoke a specific social response. 15% Pus and DUST, subversive 1990s Manchester bands, staged psycho-geographic walks around [[Hulme]] and created human collages from road signs as part of what became known as 'psycho-spectre.' [[Jamie Reid]]'s distinctive album cover artwork was openly situationist.

=== Socialism ===
[[The Clash]] were a blatantly political punk rock band, introducing [[socialism]] to the punk scene.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yfMIaUCBTWMC&amp;pg=PA47 Ensminger, David, ''Left of the Dial: Conversations with Punk Icons'' (Oakland, CA: PM Press) p. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qfACzulTwIC&amp;pg=PT327 |title=Seventies Unplugged - Gerard DeGroot - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clash frontman [[Joe Strummer]] said of his socialist views "I believe in socialism because it seems more humanitarian, rather than every man for himself and 'I'm alright jack' and all those asshole businessmen with all the loot. I made up my mind from viewing society from that angle. That's where I'm from and there's where I've made my decisions from. That's why I believe in socialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salewicz|first1=Chris|title=Redemption Song: The Ballad of Joe Strummer|date=May 13, 2008|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0865479821}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the original [[Oi!]] bands expressed a rough form of socialist [[working class]] [[populism]] — often mixed with [[patriotism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Worley |url=http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/03/20/tcbh.hwt001.full |title=Oi!

In the 1980s, several notable British socialist punk musicians were involved with [[Red Wedge]]. Notable socialist punks include: [[Attila the Stockbroker]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Bruce La Bruce]], [[Garry Bushell]] (until the late 1980s), [[The Redskins|Chris Dean]], [[The Dicks|Gary Floyd]], [[Jack Grisham]], [[Stewart Home]], [[Dennis Lyxzén]], [[Angelic Upstarts|Thomas Mensforth]], [[Fermin Muguruza]], [[Boikot|Alberto Pla]], [[Tom Robinson (musician)|Tom Robinson]], [[Seething Wells]], [[The Men They Couldn't Hang|Paul Simmonds]], [[Rob Tyner]], Joe Strummer, [[Ian Svenonius]], [[Mark Steel]] and [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] (guitarist for British powerhouse, new wave band, [[The Jam]]). Neil Eriksen wrote in 1980: "... we feel that elements of punk rock fulfill a revolutionary cultural function".&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt;

=== Straight edge ===
{{Main|Straight edge|Hardline (subculture)}}
[[Straight edge]], which originated in the [[Washington, D.C.]] hardcore punk scene with [[Minor Threat]] song "Straight Edge" written by frontman [[Ian MacKaye]] and guitarist Brian Baker. Straight edge involves abstaining from [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], and [[recreational drug use]]. Some who claim the title straight edge also abstain from [[caffeine]], casual sex and meat. (Although the Washington straight-edge scene exhibited a fierce allegiance for Coca-Cola, with supporters rarely, if ever, seen drinking anything else in public.){{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} Those more strict individuals may be considered part of the [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline subculture]]. Unlike the shunning of meat and caffeine, refraining from casual sex was without question a practice in the original straight edge lifestyle, but it has been overlooked in many of the later reincarnations of straight edge. For some, straight edge is a simple lifestyle preference, but for others it is a political stance. In many cases, it is a rejection of the perceived self-destructive qualities of punk and hardcore culture. MacKaye has often spoken out against others labeling themselves as being Straight edge, which was never his intentions for it being a label but it became a movement one in which he became annoyed with. Notable straight edgers: [[Tim McIlrath]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Davey Havok]].

== Criticism of punk ideologies ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
Punk ideologies have been criticized from outside and within. [[The Clash]] occasionally accused other contemporary punk acts of selling out, such as in their songs "[[(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais]]" and "[[London Calling|Death or Glory]]". [[Crass]]'s song "White Punks on Hope" criticizes the late-1970s British punk scene in general and, among other things, accuses [[Joe Strummer]] of selling out and betraying his earlier principles. Their song "Punk is Dead" attacks corporate [[Recuperation (sociology)|co-option]] of the [[punk subculture]]. [[Dead Kennedys]] frontman [[Jello Biafra]] wrote many songs, such as '' [[Nazi Punks Fuck Off]]'', criticizing aspects of the punk subculture:  ''"Punk ain't no religious cult
Punk means thinking for yourself
You ain't hardcore cos you spike your hair...”''

[[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] frontman [[Michale Graves]], who cofounded the [[Conservative Punk]] website, argued that punks have become "[[hippie]]s with [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawks]]". However, he has since distanced himself from conservatism.

The English [[Maoist]] organisation, the [[Progressive Cultural Association]] published a tract called "Punk Rock Is Fascist", which says punk rock is part of a reactionary plot to spread fascism by diverting youth's energy away from revolutionary activities.  They also claim punk acts as part of the divide and rule stratagem of American imperialism by creating both a Generation gap and pitting youth against each other. One of its founders, the classical composer, [[Cornelius Cardew]], called [[The Clash]] "Reactionary".

In their book ''[[The Rebel Sell]]'', [[Joseph Heath]] and [[Andrew Potter]] argue that [[counterculture]] politics have failed, and that the punk understanding of society is flawed. They also argue that alternative and mainstream lifestyles ultimately have the same values.

      <text bytes="10215" xml:space="preserve">'''Political globalization''' refers to the growth of the worldwide [[political system]], both in size and complexity. That system includes [[Government|national government]]s, their [[governmental organizations|governmental]] and [[intergovernmental organizations]] as well as government-independent elements of [[global civil society]] such as [[international non-governmental organizations]] and [[social movement organization]]s. One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the [[nation-state]] and the rise of other actors on the political scene. The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] is called one of the classic examples of political globalization.

Political globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being [[economic globalization]] and [[cultural globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA146|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William R. Thompson]] has defined it as "the expansion of a global political system, and its institutions, in which inter-regional transactions (including, but certainly not limited to trade) are managed".&lt;ref name="ModelskiDevezas2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Modelski|author2=Tessaleno Devezas|author3=William R.

Moghadam defined it as "an increasing trend toward [[multilateralism]] (in which the [[United Nations]] plays a key role), toward an emerging 'transnational state apparatus,' and toward the emergence of national and [[international nongovernmental organizations]] that act as watchdogs over governments and have increased their activities and influence".&lt;ref name="Moghadam2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valentine M. Moghadam|title=Globalizing Women: Transnational Feminist Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuIt1k8wCp8C&amp;pg=PA35|date=20 January 2005|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8024-7|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manfred B.

But it also refers to the spread and influence of [[international non-governmental organization]]s, [[social movement organization]]s and transnational advocacy networks operating across borders and constituting a kind of [[global civil society]]."&lt;ref name="AmentaNash2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Crouch|chapter=Democracy and Capitalism in the Wake of the Financial Crisis|editor1=Edwin Amenta|editor2=Kate Nash|editor3=Alan Scott|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uz8gk5-a5CUC&amp;pg=PT487|date=2 February 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5507-9|page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, [[Gerard Delanty]] and [[Chris Rumford]] define it as "a tension between three processes which interact to produce the complex field of [[global politics]]: global [[geopolitics]], global [[normative culture]] and [[polycentric networks]]."&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
[[Salvatore Babones]] discussing sources used by scholars for studying political globalizations noted the usefulness of [[Europa World Year Book]] for data on diplomatic relationships between countries, publications of [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] such as ''The Military Balance'' for matters of military, and US government publication ''Patterns of Global Terrorism'' for matters of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-152"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Babones|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Studying Globalization: Methodological Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political globalization is measured by aggregating and weighting data on the number of embassies and high commissioners in a country, the number of the country's membership in international organization, its participation in the UN peacekeeping missions, and the number of international treaties signed by said country. This measure has been used by [[Axel Dreher]], [[Noel Gaston]], [[Pim Martens]] [[Jeffrey Haynes]] and is available from the [[KOF institute]] at [[ETH Zurich]]&lt;ref name="Haynes2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Haynes|title=Religion and Political Change in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z-DCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT64|date=7 September 2015|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-69699-5|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Welfens2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J.J.

==Aspects==
[[Dimensions of globalization|Like globalization itself]], political globalization has several dimensions and lends itself to a number of interpretations. It has been discussed in the context of new emancipatory possibilities, as well as in the context of loss of autonomy and fragmentation of the social world.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-414"/&gt; Political globalization can be seen in changes such as [[democratization]] of the world, creation of the global [[civil society]],&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-426"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerard Delanty|author2=Chris Rumford|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|chapter=Political Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|page=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moving beyond the centrality of the [[nation-state]], particularly as the sole actor in the field of politics.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt; Some of the questions central to the discussion of the political globalization are related to the future of the nation-state, whether its importance is diminishing and what are the causes for those changes; and understanding the emergence of the concept of [[global governance]].&lt;ref name="Steger2003-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA57|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation and existence of the [[United Nations]] has been called one of the classic examples of political globalization.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Annabelle Mooney|author2=Betsy Evans|title=Globalization: The Key Concepts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCV-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA194|date=12 March 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-20472-4|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political actions by non-governmental organizations and social movements, concerned about various topics such as [[environmental protection]], is another example.&lt;ref name="MooneyEvans2007"/&gt;

[[David Held]] has proposed that continuing political globalization may lead to the creation of a [[world government]]-like [[cosmopolitan democracy]], though this vision has also been criticized as too idealistic.&lt;ref name="Steger2003-68"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred B. Steger|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgVRoIOhYegC&amp;pg=PA68|date=27 March 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political Globalization and Nation State==
There is a heated debate over Political Globalization and Nation State. The question arises whether or not political globalization signifies the decline of the nation-state. Hyper globalists argue that globalization has engulfed today's world in such a way that state boundaries are beginning to lose significance. However, skeptics disregard this as naiveté, believing that the nation-state remains the supreme actor in international relations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://internationalaffairsbd.com/political-globalization-nation-state/|title=Contemporary Debate on Political Globalization and Nation StateYeg=PA68|author=|first=|last2=|date=2017|publisher=International Affairs, UK|year=|isbn=978-0-19-153938-1|location=|page=68|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legislation''' (or "statutory law") is law which has been [[promulgation|promulgated]] (or "[[enactment of a bill|enacted]]") by a [[legislature]] or other [[Government|governing body]] or the process of making it.&lt;ref&gt;See Article 289(3) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]&lt;/ref&gt; Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]], and may be broadly referred to as "legislation", while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare or to restrict. It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act which is adopted by an [[Executive (government)|executive]] or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act or for implementing a legislative act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Is the European Legislator after Lisbon a real Legislature?  |author=Wim Voermans |journal=Legislacao Cadernos de Ciencia de Legislacao |volume=50 |pages=391–413 [402] |date=December 2009  |quote=Within the category of legal acts provided for by the TFEU, a distinction is made between legislative acts and non-legislative acts. Legislative acts are decisions adopted under the ordinary or special legislative procedure (Article 289(3) of the TFEU) and non-legislative acts are decisions that are adopted pursuant to delegation or for the purpose of implementing a legislative act (Articles 35 See Article 288 of the TFEU, last 290 and 291 of the TFEU)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Westminster system]], an item of primary legislation is known as an [[Act of Parliament]] after enactment.

Legislation is usually proposed by a member of the legislature (e.g. a member of Congress or Parliament), or by the executive, where upon it is debated by members of the legislature and is often amended before [[passage (legislature)|passage]]. Most large legislatures enact only a small fraction of the bills proposed in a given [[Session (parliamentary andprocedure)|session]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/two_column_table/Resumes.htm Senate.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Whether a given bill will be proposed is generally a matter of the legislative priorities of government.

Legislation is regarded as one of the three main functions of government, which are often distinguished under the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]]. Those who have the formal power to ''create'' legislation are known as [[legislator]]s; a [[judiciary|judicial branch]] of government will have the formal power to ''interpret'' legislation (see [[statutory interpretation]]); the [[executive branch]] of government can act only within the powers and limits set by the law, which is the instrument by which the fundamental powers of government are established.

== Latest revision ==
The function and procedures are primarily the responsibility of the legislature. However, there are situations where legislation is made by other bodies or means, such as when [[constitutional law]] or [[secondary legislation]] is enacted. Such other forms of law-making include [[referendum]]s, [[Order in Council|orders in council]] or [[regulations]]. The term ''legislation'' is sometimes used to include these situations, or the term ''[[primary legislation]]'' may be used to exclude these other forms.

=== Public Participation in Legislation ===
All modern constitutions and fundamental laws contain and declare the concept and principle of popular sovereignty, which essentially means that the people are the ultimate source of public power or government authority. The concept of popular sovereignty holds simply that in a society organized for political action, the will of the people as a whole is the only right standard of political action. It can be regarded as an important element in the system of the checks and balances, and representative democracy. Therefore, the people are implicitly entitled even to directly participate in the process of law making. This role of linking citizens and their government and legislators is closely related to the concept of legitimacy. The exercise of democratic control over the legislative system and the policy-making process can occur even when the public has only an elementary understanding of the national legislative institution and its membership. Civic education is a vital strategy for strengthening public participation and confidence in the legislative process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vértesy|first=László|date=2017-01-10|title=The Public Participation in the Drafting of Legislation in Hungary|url=http://cepar.fu.uni-lj.si/index.php/CEPAR/article/view/333|journal=Central European Public Administration Review|volume=14|issue=4|doi=10.17573/ipar.2016.4.06|issn=2591-2259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dead letter==
{{Expand section|date=September 2016}}
The phrase "dead letter" refers to legislation that has not been revoked, but that has become inapplicable, obsolete, or is no longer enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/dead-letter Dead Letter]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The mid-19th century [[Scandinavism]] political movement led to the modern use of the term [[Scandinavia]].]]

In the [[social science]]s, a '''political movement''' is a [[social group]] that operates together to obtain a [[political]] [[goal]],&lt;ref&gt;[[dict:political movement|Political movement]]. dict.org&lt;/ref&gt; on a local, regional, national, or international scope. Political [[Political process theory|movements develop]], [[Coordination game|coordinate]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Coordination failure (political science)|Coordination failure]]&lt;/ref&gt; promulgate,&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[decree]]s, [[Speech_act#Classifying_illocutionary_speech_acts|declaration]]s, and [[wikt:announcement|announcement]]s&lt;/ref&gt; revise,&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[Historical revisionism|political revisionism]] and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negationism]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amendment|amend]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Constitutional amendment]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermeneutics|interpret]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Judicial interpretation]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Propaganda|produce materials]] that are intended to address the goals of the [[Identity politics|base of the movement]]. A [[social movement]] in the area of [[politics]] can be organized around a single issue or set of issues, or around a set of shared concerns of a [[social group]]. In a [[political party]], a [[political organization]] seeks to influence, or control, [[government policy]], usually by nominating their candidates and seating candidates in politics and governmental offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mc Donald|first=Neil|title=The Study of Political Parties|year=1963|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parties participate in [[elections|electoral campaigns]] and educational outreach or protest actions aiming to convince citizens or governments to take action on the issues and concerns which are the focus of the movement. Parties often espouse an [[ideology]], expressed in a party program, bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [coalition] among [[:wiktionary:disparate|disparate]] interests.

==Examples==
Some political movements have aimed to change government policy, such as the [[Peace movement|anti-war movement]], the [[ecology movement]], and the [[anti-globalization movement]].  Many have aimed to establish or broaden the rights of subordinate groups, such as [[abolitionism]], the [[women's suffrage]] movement, the [[civil rights movement]], [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]], the [[disability rights movement]], or the inclusive [[human rights]] movement.  Some have represented class interests, such as the [[Labour movement]], [[socialism]], and [[communism]], others have expressed national aspirations, such as [[Anticolonialism|anticolonialist]] movements, [[Ratana]], [[Zionism]], and [[Sinn Féin]].  Political movements can also involve struggles to decentralize or centralize state control, as in [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], and [[Nazism]].

With [[globalization]], [[global citizens movement]]s may have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Global Citizens Movement. A New Actor For a New Politics | publisher=TransNational Institute | date=2001-10-18 | author=George, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements may be named by outsiders, as with the [[levellers]] political movement in 17th century England was so named as a [[term of disparagement]]. Yet admirers of the movement and its aims later came to use the term, and it is the term by which they are known to history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Plant, David | url = http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/levellers.htm | title = The Levellers | accessdate = 2013-06-05| date = 2005-12-14 | work = British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''extrajudicial killing''' (also known as '''extrajudicial execution''') is the killing of a person by governmental authorities or individuals without the sanction of any [[Judiciary|judicial proceeding]] or legal process. Extrajudicial killings often target leading political, trade union, dissident, religious, and social figures.

== United Nations ==
[[Agnes Callamard|Agnès Callamard]] is the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions&lt;ref&gt;Special Rapporteur on executions [https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Executions/Pages/SRExecutionsIndex.aspx OHCHR]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)]].

When General Augusto Pinochet assumed power in 1973, he immediately ordered the purges, torture, and deaths of more than 3,000 supporters of the previous government without trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War Crimes and Justice: A Reference Handbook|last=Ball|first=Howard|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2002|isbn=157607899X|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|regime]], which lasted from 1973 to 1989, elements of the military and [[carabineros de Chile|police]] continued committing extrajudicial killings. These included Manuel Contreras, the former head of Chile's [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|National Intelligence Directorate]] (DINA), which served as Pinochet's [[secret police]]. He was behind numerous assassinations and human rights abuses such as the 1974 abduction and [[forced disappearance]] of Socialist Party leader [[Victor Olea Alegria]]. Some of the killings were also coordinated with other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone in the so-called [[Operation Condor]].

During the [[El Salvador Civil War|Salvadoran civil war]], death squads achieved notoriety when far-right vigilantes assassinated Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] for his social activism in March 1980. In December 1980, [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|four Americans—three nuns and a lay worker—were raped and murdered]] by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of peasants and activists, including such notable priests as [[Rutilio Grande]]. Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and training from American advisors during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, these events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} although death squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981–1989) as well.

==== Honduras ====
[[Honduras]] also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was [[Battalion 316]].  Hundreds of people, including teachers, politicians and union bosses, were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-negroponte1a-story.html|title=When a wave of torture and murder staggered a small U.S. ally, truth was a casualty.|first=Gary Cohn and Ginger|last=Thompson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States ====
One of the most recent issues regarding extrajudicial killing has been the debate about the legal and moral status of [[Targeted killing#Use by the United States Government|targeted killing by unmanned aerial vehicles by the United States]].

Section 3(a) of the [[United States]] [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] contains a definition of extrajudicial killing:

{{quote|a deliberate killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regular constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term, however, does not include any such killing that, under international law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Congressional Record, V. 147, Pt. 6, May 9, 2001 to May 21 2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCYK7X_SqHIC&amp;pg=PA7897|date=October 2005|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|page=7897|id=GGKEY:2126SDPKSFJ|isbn = 9780160729669}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The legal exclusion in the sentence that starts "Such term, however ..." covers the killing of [[enemy combatant]]s and others who are not protected under international law from extrajudicial killing.}} }}

The legality of killings such as in the [[death of Osama bin Laden]] in 2011 and the death of [[Qasem Soleimani]] in 2020 have been brought into question. In that case, the US defended itself claiming the killing was not an assassination but an act of "National Self Defense".&lt;ref name=OBLQ&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Aiden|title=Osama Bin Laden: Legality of Killing questioned|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13318372|accessdate=June 16, 2017|agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|date=May 12, 2011|ref=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13318372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Chain murders of Iran}}

In 1953 a regime was installed through the efforts of the American [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the British [[MI6]] in which the Shah (hereditary monarch) [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] used [[SAVAK]] death squads (also trained by the CIA) to imprison, torture and/or kill hundreds of dissidents.  After the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] death squads were used to an even greater extent by the new Islamic government. In 1983, the CIA gave the Supreme Leader of Iran—[[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]—information on [[KGB]] agents in Iran. This information was probably used. The Iranian government later used death squads occasionally throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; however by the 2000s it seems to have almost entirely, if not completely, ceased using them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/the-chain-murders-1988-1998.html|title=The Chain Murders|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=October 29, 2018|website=Tehran Bureau|publisher=PBS|last=Sahim|first=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq was formed by the partition and domination of various tribal lands by the British in the early 20th century. Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. [[King Ghazi]] of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), for fear that the government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the [[Axis powers]]. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947. Iraq was left with a national government led from [[Baghdad]] made up of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ethnicity in key positions of power, ruling over an ad-hoc nation splintered by tribal affiliations. This leadership used death squads and committed massacres in Iraq throughout the 20th century, culminating in the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/9/13/14133/1410/|title=History of Iraq: 1933 - 1939|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has since become increasingly partitioned following the [[Iraq War]] into three zones: a [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish ethnic zone]] to the north, a Sunni center and the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] ethnic zone to the south. The [[Secularism|secular]] [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] [[Ba'ath Party|Baathist]] leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia (Prime Minister) and Kurdish (President of the Republic) peoples of the nation. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish ([[Peshmerga]]).

The victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni [[insurgency]]. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. These killings are not limited to men; women and children have also been arrested and/or killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='25,000 civilians' killed in Iraq |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4692589.stm |publisher=BBC |date=2005-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these killings have also been part of simple robberies or other criminal activities.

A feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of the ''New York Times'' claimed that the U.S. military had modelled the "Wolf Brigade", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads used in the 1980s to crush the left-wing insurgency in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name=Nytimes050501&gt;{{cite news |title=The Way of the Commandos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01ARMY.html?ei=5088&amp;en=f0604488a64924cd&amp;ex=1272686400&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= |work=The New York Times |date=2005-05-01 |first=Peter |last=Maass |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western news organizations such as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and [[People (magazine)|''People'']] disassembled this by focusing on aspects such as probable [[militia]] membership, religious ethnicity, as well as uniforms worn by these squads rather than stating the [[United States]]-backed Iraqi government had death squads active in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4719252.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Iraq 'death squad caught in act' |date=February 16, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 [[Amnesty International]] published its first report on [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial executions]] in Turkey.&lt;ref name="ob.nubati.net"/&gt; In the following years the problem became more serious. The [[Human Rights Foundation of Turkey]] determined the following figures on extrajudicial executions in Turkey for the years 1991 to 2001:&lt;ref&gt;Source: Report for 2001, published on 10 March 2003, Ankara, {{ISBN|975-7217-38-7}}, page 49 (Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nguyễn Văn Lém]] (referred to as Captain Bay Lop) (died 1 February 1968 in  Saigon) was a member of the [[Viet Cong]] who was summarily shot in [[Saigon]] during the [[Tet Offensive]].

====Belarus====
[[File:Zniknąć 03 - Czarownik ciągnie za uszy.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in [[Warsaw]], reminding about the disappearances of oppositionals in Belarus.]]

In 1999 [[Belarus]]ian opposition leaders [[Yury Zacharanka]] and [[Viktar Hanchar]] together with his business associate [[Anatol Krasouski]] disappeared. Hanchar and Krasouski disappeared the same day of a broadcast on state television in which President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] ordered the chiefs of his security services to crack down on “opposition scum”. Although the [[State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus]] (KGB) had them under constant surveillance, the official investigation announced that the case could not be solved. The disappearance of journalist [[Dzmitry Zavadski]] in 2000 has also yielded no results. Copies of a report by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=16 Years of Silence: Enforced Disappearances in Belarus Must Be Investigated |url=http://blog.amnestyusa.org/europe/16-years-of-silence-enforced-disappearances-in-belarus-must-be-investigated/  | newspaper=[[Amnesty International]]|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] claims that Zacharanka, Hanchar, Krasouski and Zavadski likely became victims of extrajudicial executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Report: Belarus: Events of 2005 |url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2006/country-chapters/belarus  | newspaper=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been regarded that the [[Alexander Litvinenko assassination theories|Alexander Litvinenko]] murder was linked to Russian special forces. USA and UK intelligence agents reportedly claim that Russian assassins, some possibly at orders of the government, are behind at least fourteen [[targeted killing]]s on British soil that police called non-suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-police-evidence-russian-assassins-behind-14-suspicious-deaths-british-soil-boris-berezovsky-scot-a7793151.html|title=UK authorities 'overtlooked' evidence linking Russia to deaths on British soil|date=16 June 2017|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom attributes the [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]] in March 2018 to the Russian military-intelligence agency [[GRU (G.U.)|GRU]].

==== Soviet Union ====
In [[Bolshevist Russia|Soviet Russia]] since 1918 [[Cheka]] was authorized to execute "counterevolutionaries" without trial. Hostages were also executed by Cheka during the [[Red Terror]] in 1918–1920. The [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|successors of Cheka]] also had the authority for extrajudicial executions. In 1937–38 hundreds of thousands where executed extrajudicially during the [[Great Purge]] under the lists approved by [[NKVD troika]]s. In some cases the Soviet special services did not arrest and then execute their victims but just secretly killed them without any arrest. For example, [[Solomon Mikhoels]] was murdered in 1948 and his body was run over to create the impression of a traffic accident. The Soviet special services also conducted extrajudicial killings abroad, most notably of [[Leon Trotsky]] in 1940 in [[Mexico]], [[Stepan Bandera]] in 1959 in Germany, [[Georgi Markov]] in 1978 in London.

==== Spain ====
{{Main|GAL (paramilitary_group)}}

From 1983 until 1987, the Spanish government supported paramilitary squads, denominated [[GAL (paramilitary group)|GAL]], to fight [[ETA_(separatist_group)|ETA]], a Basque terrorist organization. A relevant example was the [[Killing of Lasa and Zabala| Lasa and Zabala case]], in which José Antonio Lasa and José Ignacio Zabala were kidnapped, tortured and executed by police forces in 1983.

Operation Kratos referred to tactics developed by London's Metropolitan Police Service for dealing with suspected suicide bombers, most notably firing shots to the head without warning. Little was revealed about these tactics until after the [[Death of Jean Charles de Menezes|mistaken shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes]] on 22 July 2005.

A '''term of office''' is the length of time a person serves in a particular [[elected office]]. In many jurisdictions there is a defined limit on how long terms of office may be before the officeholder must be subject to [[re-election]]. Some jurisdictions exercise [[term limit]]s, setting a maximum number of terms an individual may hold in a particular office.

==United Kingdom==
Being the origin of the [[Westminster system]], aspects of the [[United Kingdom]]'s system of government are replicated in many other countries.

===Monarch===
The [[Monarch of the United Kingdom|monarch]] serves as head of state until his or her death or [[abdication]].

===House of Commons===
{{see also|House of Commons of the United Kingdom}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] Members of Parliament (MPs) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] are elected for the duration of the parliament. Following [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolution]] of the Parliament, a [[General elections (UK)|general election]] is held which consists of simultaneous elections for all seats. For most MPs this means that their terms of office are identical to the duration of the Parliament, though an individual's term may be cut short by death or [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation]]. An MP elected in a [[UK Parliamentary by-elections|by-election]] mid-way through a Parliament, regardless of how long they have occupied the seat, is not exempt from facing [[re-election]] at the next general election.

The [[Septennial Act 1715]] provided that a Parliament expired seven years after it had been summoned; this maximum period was reduced to five years by the [[Parliament Act 1911]]. Prior to the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]] parliaments had no minimum duration. Parliaments could be dissolved early by the monarch at the [[Prime Minister]]'s request. Early dissolutions occurred when the make-up of Parliament made forming government impossible (as occurred in [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|1974]]), or, more commonly, when the incumbent government reasoned an early general election would improve their re-election chances (e.g. [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]). The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 mandated that Parliaments should last their full five years. Early dissolution is still possible, but under much more limited circumstances.

Because the [[government of the United Kingdom|government]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] are effectively [[Indirect election|indirectly elected]] through the Commons, the terms of Parliaments and MPs do not directly apply to offices of government, though in practice these are affected by changes in Parliament. While, strictly speaking, a Prime Minister whose incumbency spans multiple Parliaments only serves one, unbroken, term of office, some writers may refer to the different Parliaments as separate terms.&lt;ref name="Thatcher 3terms"&gt;{{cite web|title=Margaret Thatcher|url=http://www.biography.com/people/margaret-thatcher-9504796|website=Biography.com|accessdate=5 February 2016|quote="During her three terms…"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Lords===
[[Hereditary peer]]s and [[life peers]] retain membership of the [[House of Lords]] for life, though members can resign or be expelled. [[Lords Spiritual]] hold membership of the House of Lords until the end of their time as bishops, though a senior bishop may be made a life peer upon the end of their bishopric (e.g. [[George Carey]], made ''Baron Carey of Clifton'' the day after he ceased being [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]).

===Devolved administrations===
The [[devolution|devolved administrations]] in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are variations on the system of government used at [[Westminster]].

The office of the leader of the devolved administrations has no numeric term limit imposed upon it. However, in the case of the [[Scottish Government]] and the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] there are fixed terms for which the [[legislatures]] can sit. This is imposed at eight years. Elections may be held before this time but only if no administration can be formed, which has not happened yet.

===Other elected offices===
Offices of [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]] other regional elected officials follow similar rules to the national offices discussed above, with persons elected to fixed terms of a few years.

==United States==

===Federal===
{{main|Federal government of the United States}}
In the [[United States]], the [[president of the United States]] is elected indirectly through the [[United States Electoral College]] to a four-year term, with a [[term limit]] of two terms (totaling eight years) or a maximum of &lt;u&gt;ten&lt;/u&gt; years if the president acted as president for two years or less in a term where another was elected as president, imposed by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1951.

The [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] also serves four-year terms. [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] serve two-year terms. [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] serve six year terms.

[[Federal judges]] have different terms in office. [[Article I and Article III tribunals|Article I judges]]; such as those that sit on the [[United States bankruptcy court]]s, [[United States Tax Court]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]], and certain other [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] and other forms of [[United States administrative law|adjudicative bodies]] serve limited terms: The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for 15 years, bankruptcy courts for 14. However, the majority of the federal judiciary, Article III judges (such as those of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], [[United States court of appeals|courts of appeal]], and [[United States district court|federal district courts]]), serve for life.

===State and territories===
{{main|State governments of the United States}}
The terms of office for officials in state governments varies according to the provisions of [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]] and [[state law]].

The term for [[state governor]]s is four years in all states but [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]]; the [[Governor of Vermont|Vermont]] and [[Governor of New Hampshire|New Hampshire governors]] serve for two years.

The [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] reported in January 2007 that among [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090429232858/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/legismgt/about/numoflegis.htm]:
*44 states had terms of office for the [[lower house]] of the state legislature (often termed the state House of Representatives) at two years. Five ([[Alabama House of Representatives|Alabama]], [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana]], [[Maryland House of Delegates|Maryland]], [[Mississippi House of Representatives|Mississippi]], and [[North Dakota House of Representatives|North Dakota]]) had terms of office at four years. (The [[Nebraska Legislature]] is an exception and has a [[Unicameralism|unicameral legislature]] with members elected for four years.)
*37 states had terms of office for the [[upper house]] of the state legislature (often termed the state Senate) at four years. Twelve ([[Arizona Senate|Arizona]], [[Connecticut Senate|Connecticut]], [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia]], [[Idaho Senate|Idaho]], [[Maine Senate|Maine]], [[Massachusetts Senate|Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire Senate|New Hampshire]], [[New York State Senate|New York]], [[North Carolina Senate|North Carolina]], [[Rhode Island Senate|Rhode Island]], [[South Dakota Senate|South Dakota]], [[Vermont Senate|Vermont]]) had terms of office at two years.

Among [[territories of the United States]]:
*In the [[American Samoa Fono]], members of the [[American Samoa House of Representatives|House]] serve two-year terms while members of the [[American Samoa Senate|Senate]] serve six-year terms.
*Members of both chambers of the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico]] have four-year terms.
*Members of both chambers of the [[Northern Mariana Islands Commonwealth Legislature]] have two-year terms.
*The [[Legislature of Guam]] and [[Legislature of the Virgin Islands]] are unicameral and Senators have two-year terms.

Members of [[Council of the District of Columbia]] serve a four-year term.

==Canada==
As a former British territory following the [[Westminster System]], there are many similarities with the United Kingdom, although with some variations based on local customs, the federal system of government and the absentee monarch.

===Monarch===
Being a [[Commonwealth realm]], Canada shares a [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch]] with the United Kingdom and 14 other countries, who serves as head of state of all 16 realms until their death or abdication.

===Viceroys===
The [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] is appointed by the monarch as his/her personal representative on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], and serves [[At Her Majesty's Pleasure|for an indefinite term]], though the normal convention is 5 years. Similarly, the [[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|Lieutenant Governors]], who represent the monarch at the provincial level, are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister (usually also with consultation of the relevant provincial [[Premier (Canada)|premier]]), and generally also serve 5 year terms by convention. The territories have [[Commissioner#Canadian territories|Commissioners]], who are not representatives of the monarch, but are instead appointed by and represent the [[Queen-in-Council|Governor-in-Council]] (i.e. the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]]), and conventionally serve for about 5 years.

===House of Commons===
{{see also|House of Commons of Canada}}

Similar to the United Kingdom, MPs serve for the duration of the Parliament. They may resign before the end of a Parliament or be elected in [[by-election]]s during the middle of a Parliament.

Under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], a Parliament may last for a maximum of 5 years from the most recent election before expiring, although all Parliaments to date have been dissolved before they could expire. Bill C-16, introduced in the [[39th Canadian Parliament|39th Parliament]], provided for fixed election dates every 4 years on the third Monday in October, beginning in 2009. However, the Prime Minister may still advise the Governor General to dissolve Parliament at any time.

As in the United Kingdom, the cabinet and head of government are indirectly elected based on the composition of the House of Commons, they are not technically affected by the terms of legislators or Parliaments. In practice however, the terms of government office holders are affected by changes in the House of Commons, and those who serve for multiple consecutive Parliaments are generally considered to have served a single term. The term of a government generally ends when it is defeated on a confidence matter or the governing party fails to gain enough seats in a general election.

===Senate===

Senators are appointed to the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]] to represent a province by the Governor General of Canada on the advice of the Prime Minister, and serve until the mandatory retirement age of 75. Senators appointed before the passage of the [[British North America Act, 1965]] served for life. Senators may also resign from office or be expelled from the Senate.

===Provincial and Territorial Legislatures===
{{see also|Legislative assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories}}

Provincial legislatures and the legislature of the Yukon function very similarly to the federal House of Commons. MLAs (called MPPs in [[Ontario]], MNAs in [[Quebec]], and MHAs in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]) serve for the duration of the legislature, though they may resign before the legislature is dissolved or be elected in by-elections between general elections. The legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] operate using a [[Consensus government in Canada|consensus]] model, but are similar otherwise. The premiers and their cabinets are selected in the same way as in the House of Commons, and like at the federal level, the term of a provincial government can be ended by defeat in a general election or the loss of the legislature's confidence.

All provincial legislatures except that of [[Nova Scotia]] have fixed-term election legislation in place, as does the legislature of the Northwest Territories. Premiers may also advise Lieutenant Governors to dissolve legislatures at any time before the prescribed election date.

Numbers in years unless stated otherwise. Note that some countries where [[fixed-term election]]s are uncommon, the legislature is almost always dissolved earlier than its expiry date. "[[Life tenure|Until removed from office]]" refers to offices that don't have fixed terms; in these cases, the officeholder(s) may serve indefinitely until death, abdication, resignation, retirement, or forcible removal from office (such as [[impeachment]]).

In cases where the [[head of government]] is a different person from the head of state, its term of office is identical to the chamber that elected it (the legislature if it is unicameral, or most usually the [[lower house]] if it is bicameral), unless it doesn't survive a [[vote of no confidence]].

'''Politics''' is the set of activities associated with the [[governance]] of a country, state or an area. It involves [[Decision-making|making decisions]] that apply to groups of members.&lt;ref name="HagueHarrop2013"/&gt;

It refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance—organized control over a human community, particularly a [[state (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/political|title=Political &amp;#124; Definition of Political by Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-webster.com|date=|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic study focusing on just politics, which is therefore more targeted than general [[political science]], is sometimes referred to as [[politology]] (not to be confused with [[politicology]], a synonym for political science).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nativekhabar.com/politics|title=Politics Samachar|publisher=nativekhabar.com|date=|accessdate=24 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[nation-state]]s, people often form [[political party|political parties]] to represent their ideas. Members of a party often agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Sartori|title=Parties and Party Systems: A Framework for Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ywr0CcGDNHwC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2005|publisher=ECPR Press|isbn=978-0-9547966-1-7|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[election]] is usually a competition between different parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Rose|author2=Neil Munro|title=Parties and Elections in New European Democracies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfxMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=1 April 2009|publisher=ECPR Press|isbn=978-0-9558203-2-8|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of political parties worldwide are: the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in [[South Africa]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] (D) in the [[United States]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) in [[Germany]] and the [[Indian National Congress]] in [[India]] which has the highest number of political parties in the world (2546 political parties) &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=List of political parties in India|date=2019-12-31|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_political_parties_in_India&amp;oldid=933321415|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
Politics is a multifaceted word. It has a set of fairly specific meanings that are descriptive and nonjudgmental (such as "the art or science of government" and "political principles"), but does often colloquially carry a negative connotation.&lt;ref name="HagueHarrop2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rod Hague|author2=Martin Harrop|title=Comparative Government and Politics: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUEdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=31 May 2013|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1-137-31786-5|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=William A.

During the past decade two tendencies (1.Concern for theoretical explication and [[methodological rigor]], and 2. The emphasis on field studies of the “emerging,” “new,” and “non-Western” nations) made it possible to overlook comparative politics. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Almond|first=Gabriel A.|chapter=A Developmental Approach to Political Systems|date=1986-12-31|pages=41–72|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5446-2|doi=10.1515/9781400854462.41|title=Political System and Change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[political system]] is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a  society. The [[history of political thought]] can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]],'' the works of [[Confucius]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political System and Change: A World Politics Reader|date=1986|publisher=Princeton University Press|jstor = j.ctt7ztn7s}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arthashastra]] and Chanakya neeti by [[Chanakya]] in 3rd Century BCE.

The word comes from the same Greek word from which the title of [[Aristotle]]'s book ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' (from {{lang-grc|Πολιτικά|''Politiká'' or ''Polis''}}, meaning "affairs of the cities"). The book title was rendered in [[Early Modern English]] in the mid-15th century as "Polettiques"&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;''The Diets and Sayings of the Philosophers'' (Early English Text Society, Original Series [https://books.google.com/books?id=M7G0AAAAIAAJ&amp;q= No. 211], 1941; reprinted 1961), p. 154: "the book of Etiques&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; and of Polettiques&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;".&lt;/ref&gt; it became "politics" in [[Modern English]]. The singular ''politic'' first attested in English 1430 and comes from [[Middle French]] ''politique'', in turn from [[Latin]] ''politicus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dpoliticus|title=A Latin Dictionary|author= Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the [[Latinisation of names|Latinization]] of the Greek πολιτικός (''politikos''), meaning amongst others "of, for, or relating to citizens", "civil", "civic", "belonging to the state",&lt;ref name="A Greek-English Lexicon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpolitiko%2Fs|author=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|accessdate=19 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924203856/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpolitiko%2Fs|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from πολίτης (''polites''), "citizen"&lt;ref name="A Greek-English Lexicon"/&gt; and that from πόλις (''[[polis]]''), "city".&lt;ref name="A Greek-English Lexicon"/&gt;

'''Semi-formal politics''' is politics in government associations, such as neighborhood associations, or student governments where [[Students' union|student government political party]] politics is often practiced. Student Union &amp; Activities promotes student success by offering a variety of programs, activities, services, and facilities that, when taken together, represent a well-considered plan for the development of a school environment. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.depts.ttu.edu/sub/strategicplan.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Informal politics''' is understood as forming alliances, exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals. Generally, this includes anything affecting one's daily life, such as the way an office or household is managed, or how one person or group exercises influence over another.&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt; Informal Politics is typically understood as everyday politics, hence the idea that "politics is everywhere".&lt;ref name="Political Geography"/&gt;

==History of state politics==
The history of politics is reflected in the origin, development, and [[economics]] of the institutions of [[government]].

===The state===
{{main article|State (polity)}}

The origin of the [[State (polity)|state]] is to be found in the development of the ''[[Ancient warfare|art of warfare]]''. Historically speaking, all political communities of the modern type owe their existence to successful warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carneiro|first=Robert L.|title=A Theory of the Origin of the State|journal=Science|date=21 August 1970|volume=169|issue=3947|doi=10.1126/science.169.3947.733|pmid=17820299|pages=733–738|bibcode=1970Sci...169..733C|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4c52e7e3539fbf4dbc163c20907e931424e91a78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kings, emperors and other types of monarchs in many countries including China and Japan, were considered divine. Of the institutions that ruled states, that of [[kingship]] stood at the forefront until the American  Revolution put an end to the "[[divine right of kings]]".{{citation needed|reason=I think that in the UK the establishment of parliamentary control around the glorious revolution did away with that.|date=August 2019}} Nevertheless, the monarchy is among the longest-lasting political institutions, dating as early as 2100 BC in Sumeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sumerian King List|url=http://gizidda.altervista.org/ebooks/Sumerian-King-List-chronology.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the 21st century AD British Monarchy. Kingship becomes an institution through the institution of [[hereditary monarchy]].

The monarch often, even in [[Monarchy|absolute monarchies]], ruled their kingdom with the aid of an elite group of advisors, a [[Privy council|council]] without which they could not maintain power. As these advisors and others outside the monarchy negotiated for power, [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchies]] emerged, which may be considered the germ of [[constitutional government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://history-world.org/absolutism.htm|work=International World History Project|title=European Absolutism And Power Politics|date=1998|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monarchist.org.uk/constitutional-monarchy.html|title=Constitutional Monarchy|publisher=British Monarchist League Ltd|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest of the monarch's subordinates, the [[earl]]s and [[duke]]s in England and Scotland, the dukes and [[count]]s in Continental Europe,  always sat as a right on the council.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} . India during the reign of the Gupta empire followed a decentralized system in which great autonomy was given to the governors of the provinces. Ancient China on the other hand followed a feudal system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.culturalindia.net/indian-history/ancient-india/ancient-government.html|title=Ancient India Government - Government In Ancient India - Law Government Ancient India|website=www.culturalindia.net|access-date=2020-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts [[tribute]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} One of the functions of the council is to keep the [[coffers]] of the monarch full. Another is the satisfaction of [[military service]] and the establishment of [[lordship]]s by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenks|first=Edward|title=A history of politics|pages=73–96|quote=The origin of the State, or Political Society, is to be found in the development of the art of military warfare.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2017.07.26 Protest Trans Military Ban, White House, Washington DC USA 7646 (36056769341).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Activism is a form of politics.]]
===Forms of political organization===
There are many forms of [[political organization]], including states, non-government organizations (NGOs) and international organizations such as the [[United Nations]]. States are perhaps the predominant institutional form of political governance, where a state is understood as an institution and a government is understood as the [[regime]] in power.

According to Aristotle, states are classified into [[monarchies]], [[aristocracy|aristocracies]], [[Timocracy|timocracies]], [[democracies]], [[oligarchies]], and [[tyrannies]]. Due to changes across the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned.

All states are varieties of a single organizational form, the sovereign state. All the [[great powers]] of the modern world rule on the principle of [[sovereignty]]. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an [[autocracy|autocratic government]] or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. [[Constitutions]] are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative and judiciary branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|website=The British Library|access-date=2019-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] but after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] abandoned them to be taken up later by the [[American Colonies]] after their [[American Revolution|emancipation]] and then [[France]] after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.

There are many forms of government. One form is a strong central government as in France and China. Another form is local government, such as the ancient divisions in England that are comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the practice of [[federal government]], first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, [[Australia]]. Federal states introduced the new principle of agreement or [[contract]]. Compared to a [[federation]], a [[confederation]] has a more dispersed system of [[judicial power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Confederation_vs_Federation|title=Confederation vs Federation – Difference and Comparison|publisher=Diffen|date=|accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[American Civil War]], the argument by the Confederate States that a State could [[secede]] from the Union was deemed unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|supreme court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Texas v. White|date=1869|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;case=1134912565671891096&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=scholarr#p726%20725|volume=74|pages=700|access-date=2019-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to professor [[A. V. Dicey]] in ''An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution'', the essential features of a federal constitution are: a) A written supreme constitution in order to prevent disputes between the jurisdictions of the Federal and State authorities; b) A distribution of power between the Federal and State governments and c) A Supreme Court vested with the power to interpret the Constitution and enforce the law of the land remaining independent of both the executive and legislative branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenks|first=Edward|title=A history of politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z3gCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=politics+history#v=onepage&amp;q=|pages=1–164|year=1900|publisher=J.

===Global politics===
{{main article|Global politics}}
'''Global politics''' include different '''practices''' of political [[globalization]] in relation to questions of social power: from global patterns of governance to issues of globalizing conflict. The 20th century witnessed the outcome of two world wars and not only the rise and fall of the [[Third Reich]] but also the rise and relative fall of [[communism]]. The development of the [[atomic bomb]] gave the United States a more rapid end to its conflict in Japan in [[World War II]]. Later, the [[hydrogen bomb]] became the ultimate weapon of mass destruction.

Global politics also concerns the rise of global and international '''organizations'''. The [[United Nations]] has served as a forum for peace in a world threatened by nuclear war, "The invention of nuclear and space weapons has made war unacceptable as an instrument for achieving political ends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rabinowitch|first=Eugene|authorlink=Eugene Rabinowitch|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-QsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=World+politics+final+nuclear+holocaust&amp;q=World%20politics%20final%20nuclear%20holocaust|date=June 1973|page=13|issn=0096-3402|quote=...the rationale of traditional patterns of world politics.|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an all-out final [[nuclear holocaust]] is radically undesirable for man, "[[nuclear blackmail]]" comes into question not only on the issue of world peace but also on the issue of national sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dulles|first=Allen|authorlink=Allen Dulles|title=The Craft of Intelligence|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mH3qdHK6_EsC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=the+craft+of+intelligence+April+1963#v=onepage&amp;q=|page=224|year=2006|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-1-59921-577-8|quote=...using 'nuclear blackmail' as a threat to intimidate other countries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a Sunday in 1962, the world stood still at the brink of nuclear war during the October [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] from the implementation of U.S. vs [[Soviet Union]] nuclear blackmail policy.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=December 2019}}

After the Soviet Union collapsed in December of 1991 the world moved from being bi-polar to being uni-polar with United States firmly ahead. However this lead has been continuously shrinking in the 21st Century with the rapid economic growth of China threatening the current American hegemony. Other world powers such as India and a resurgent Russia are also threatening America's position as the leader of the world. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cirsd.org/en/horizons/horizons-winter-2018-issue-no-10/great-powers-in-the-twenty-first-century|title=Great Powers in the Twenty-first Century|website=CIRSD|access-date=2020-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[political science]] professor [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], global politics is affected by ''values'': norms of [[human rights]], ideas of [[human development (humanity)|human development]], and beliefs such as [[cosmopolitanism]] about how we should relate to each:
{{quote|Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=2014|last1=James|first1=Paul|authorlink=Paul James (academic)|title=Globalization and Politics, Vol. 4: Political Philosophies of the Global|url=https://www.academia.edu/7547819|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|pages=x|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;br /&gt;
===Political corruption===
{{main article|Political corruption}}
[[William Pitt the Elder]], speaking before the British [[House of Lords]], 9 January 1770, observed: "Unlimited power is apt to corrupt the minds of those who possess it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|editor-first=William|editor-last=Safire|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was echoed more famously by [[John Dalberg-Acton]] over a century later: "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."&lt;ref name="lmcone"&gt;Dalberg-Acton, John (Lord Acton). [http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165acton.html Letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton, April 5, 1887]. Published in ''Historical Essays and Studies'', edited by J. N. Figgis and R. V. Laurence (London: Macmillan, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political corruption''' is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties and/or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Corruption Law &amp; Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/political-corruption|website=USLegal|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corruption in third World dictatorships is usually more blatant. For example, government cronies may be given exclusive right to make [[arbitrage]] profit by exploiting a [[fixed rate mechanism]] in government currency. In democracies corruption is often more indirect. Trade union leaders may be given priority in housing queues, giving them indirectly a worth of millions.&lt;ref&gt;Tino Sanadaji, ''Tio tusen miljarder: Skuldkalaset och den förträngda baksmällan'' (2018), kapitel 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of corruption vary, but include [[corruption]], [[extortion]], [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], [[patronage]], [[Graft (politics)|graft]], and [[embezzlement]]. While corruption may facilitate [[Organized crime|criminal enterprise]] it may be legal but considered immoral.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/corruption&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6288400.stm|title= African corruption 'on the wane'|publisher=BBC News – Business}}&lt;/ref&gt; A state of unrestrained political corruption is known as a [[kleptocracy]], literally meaning "rule by thieves".&lt;ref name="Wedeman2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Wedeman|title=Double Paradox: Rapid Growth and Rising Corruption in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pc5v1PggyusC&amp;pg=PA61|date=3 April 2012|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-6474-4|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political parties===
{{main article|Political party}}

A '''political party''' is a [[political organization]] that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within [[government]], usually by participating in [[elections|electoral campaigns]], educational outreach or protest actions. Parties often espouse an expressed [[ideology]] or vision bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [[coalition]] among disparate interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robin T. Pettitt|title=Contemporary Party Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFYdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|date=24 June 2014|publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education|isbn=978-1-137-41264-5|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics as an academic discipline===
[[Political science]], the study of politics, examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Safire|first=William|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC&amp;pg=PA566&amp;dq=power+corrupts+and+absolute+power+corrupts+absolutely#v=onepage&amp;q=power%20corrupts%20and%20absolute%20power%20corrupts%20absolutely|page=566|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-534334-2|quote=Power tends to corrupt; absolute power corrupts absolutely.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Harold Lasswell]] defined politics as "who gets what, when, and how".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmidt|first=Barbara A.|last2=Bardes|first2=Mack C.|last3=Shelley|first3=Steffen W.|title=American Government and Politics Today: The Essentials|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-538-49719-0|edition=2011–2012 Student|page=[https://archive.org/details/americangovernme0000bard/page/5 5]|url=https://archive.org/details/americangovernme0000bard/page/5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behaviour, as well as examining the preconditions for the formation of political communities;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Love's Lessons: Intimacy, Pedagogy and Political Community|first1=Timothy|last1= Laurie|first2=Hannah|last2= Stark|journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities|volume=22|issue=4|pages=69–79|year= 2017|url=https://www.academia.edu/35349930}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[political economy]], which attempts to develop understandings of the relationships between politics and the economy and the governance of the two; and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/public-administration|title=Public administration - Principles of public administration|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Charles Blattberg, who has defined politics as "responding to conflict with dialogue", offers an account which distinguishes political philosophies from political ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blattberg|first=Charles|title=Political Philosophies and Political Ideologies|journal=Public Affairs Quarterly|date=July 2001|volume=15|issue=3|pages=193–217|ssrn=1755117|accessdate=|issn=0887-0373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first academic chair devoted to politics in the United States was the chair of history and political science at [[Columbia University]], first occupied by Prussian émigré [[Francis Lieber]] in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farr|first1=James|last2=Seidelman|first2=Raymond|title=Discipline and history|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e9_jbbroRHsC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Discipline+and+history+Francis+Lieber+Karl+Marx&amp;q=|year=1993|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-06512-7|quote=...a chair at Columbia in 1857 as professor of history and political science, the very first of its kind in America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Political spectrum}}

Several different [[political spectrum|political spectra]] have been proposed.

===Left–right===
Political analysts and politicians divide politics into [[left wing]] and [[right wing]] politics, often also using the idea of center politics as a middle path of policy between the right and left. This classification is comparatively recent (it was not used by [[Aristotle]] or [[Hobbes]], for instance), and dates from the [[French Revolution]] era, when those members of the [[National Assembly]] who supported the [[republic]], the common people and a [[secular society]] sat on the left and supporters of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privilege and the Church sat on the right.&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meanings behind the labels have become more complicated over the years. A particularly influential event was the publication of the [[Communist Manifesto]] by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in 1848. The ''Manifesto'' suggested a course of action for a [[proletarian]] revolution to overthrow the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society and abolish private property, in the belief that this would lead to a [[classless]] and [[Stateless communism|stateless]] society.&lt;ref name="Shepard2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jon M. Shepard|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FzefFQ-WMlYC&amp;pg=PA214|date=12 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-59901-2|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CY3b0mcDF9QC|title=The Communist Manifesto|last=Marx|first=Karl|last2=Engels|first2=Friedrich|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-044757-6|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2018}}

The meaning of left-wing and right-wing varies considerably between different countries and at different times, but generally speaking, it can be said that the right wing often values [[tradition]] and [[social stratification|inequality]] while the left wing often values [[Social progress|progress]] and [[egalitarianism]], with the center seeking a balance between the two such as with [[social democracy]], [[libertarianism]] or [[Regulated market|regulated capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045000932.html#C|author=Daniel J. Levinson|title=Conservatism and Radicalism|encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Norberto Bobbio]], one of the major exponents of this distinction, the Left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality – believing it to be unethical or unnatural&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.&lt;ref name="Bobbio"&gt;[[Norberto Bobbio|Bobbio]], Norberto, ''Left and Right: The Significance of a Political Distinction'' (translated by Allan Cameron), 1997, [[University of Chicago Press]]. {{ISBN|0-226-06246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some ideologies, notably [[Christian Democracy]], claim to combine left and right wing politics; according to Geoffrey K. Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, "In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts and Hogwood, ''European Politics Today'', [[Manchester University Press]], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include [[Fascist]] [[Terza Posizione]] economic politics in Italy and [[Peronism]] in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Terror from the Extreme Right.|last=Tore.|first=Bjorgo|date=2014|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9781135209308|location=Hoboken|oclc=871861016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.miis.edu/media/view/18971/original/balenouvelleresarticle.pdf|title=bale p.40|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |accessdate=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authoritarian–libertarian===
[[Authoritarianism]] and [[civil libertarianism|libertarianism]] refer to the amount of individual [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] each person possesses in that society relative to the state. One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where "individual [[rights]] and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Markus Kemmelmeier|authorlink=Markus Kemmelmeier|title=Individualism, Collectivism, and Authoritarianism in Seven Societies|year=2003|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=304–322|doi=10.1177/0022022103034003005|display-authors=1|last2=Burnstein|first2=Eugene|last3=Krumov|first3=Krum|last4=Genkova|first4=Petia|last5=Kanagawa|first5=Chie|last6=Hirshberg|first6=Matthew S.|last7=Erb|first7=Hans-Peter|last8=Wieczorkowska|first8=Grazyna|last9=Noels|first9=Kimberly A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while libertarians generally oppose the [[Sovereign state|state]] and hold the [[individual]] as sovereign. In their purest form, libertarians are [[anarchism|anarchists]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/150-years-of-libertarian|title=150 years of Libertarian|author=afaq|website=Anarchists Writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who argue for the total abolition of the state, of [[political parties]] and of [[Political organisation|other political entities]], while the purest authoritarians are, by definition, [[totalitarianism|totalitarians]] who support state control over all aspects of society. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/totalitarian?s=t Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, [[classical liberalism]] (also known as ''[[laissez-faire]] liberalism'',&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;Ian Adams, ''Political Ideology Today'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001), 20.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and [[limited government]]. This includes the importance of human rationality, individual [[property rights]], [[free market]]s, [[natural rights]], the protection of [[civil liberties]], constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of [[John Locke]], [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Voltaire]], [[Montesquieu]] and others. According to the libertarian [[Institute for Humane Studies]], "the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp What Is Libertarian?], Institute for Humane Studies {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324231417/http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp|date=24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For anarchist political philosopher [[L. Susan Brown]] "Liberalism and [[anarchism]] are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual [[Freedom of will|freedom]] yet differ from one another in very distinct ways. Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[L. Susan Brown]]. ''[[The Politics of Individualism: Liberalism, Liberal Feminism, and Anarchism]]''. Black Rose Books Ltd. 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques of political spectrum ===
The critics of political spectrum criticize the uni dimensional and bi-dimensional nature of it. They also point towards it's inability to incorporate other cultures. This rigidity leads to bizarre results. An example of this would be the fact that both fascist Adolf Hitler and libertarian Milton Friedman are on the “far right,” yet Hitler advocated nationalism, socialism, militarism, authoritarianism, and anti-Semitism, while Milton Friedman advocated internationalism, capitalism, pacifism, civil liberties, and was himself a Jew. Another critic of political spectrum is it's tendency to promote tribalism by needlessly sorting people into different groups.

There are also many alternatives to political spectrum and political compass. The popular among these being the ideological triangle i.e  a way of organizing political ideology using the values of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The location of a political ideology on the triangle is a function of its preference for the three values. As one moves closer to the bottom corner, the preference for liberty increases. As one moves closer to the upper left-hand corner, the preference for equality increases. And as one moves closer to the upper right-hand corner, the preference for fraternity increases and political horseshoe i.e the '''horseshoe''' theory asserts that the far-left and the far-right, rather than being at opposite and opposing ends of a linear '''political''' continuum, closely resemble one another, analogous to the way that the opposite ends of a '''horseshoe''' are close together.

A '''political pensioner''' enjoys a [[pension]] awarded due to his or political career or significance.

== UK domestic politicians ==
{{outdated|section|date=September 2018}}
By the [[Political Offices Pension Act 1869]], pensions were instituted for those who had held political office. For the purposes of the act, political offices were divided into three classes:
# those with a yearly salary of not less than £5,000; 
# those with a salary of less than £5,000 and not less than £2,000;
# those with a salary of less than £2,000 and more than £1,000.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Pension |volume=21 |page=120 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For service in these offices there may be awarded pensions for life in the following scale: 
# a first class pension not exceeding £2,000 a year, in respect of not less than four years service or its equivalent, in an office of the first class; 
# a second class pension not exceeding £1,200, in respect of service of not less than six years or its equivalent, in an office of the second class; 
# a third class pension not exceeding £800 a year, in respect of service of not less than ten years in an office of the third class.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The service need not be continuous, and the act makes provision for counting service in lower classes as a qualification for pension in a higher class. These pensions are limited in number to twelve, but a holder must not receive any other pension out of the public revenue, if so, he must inform the treasury and surrender it if it exceeds his political pension, or if under he must deduct the amount. He may, however, hold office while a pensioner, but the pension is not payable during the time he holds office. To obtain a political pension, the applicant must file a declaration stating the grounds upon which he claims it and that his income from other sources is not sufficient to maintain his station in life.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Colonial ==
{{Princely states topics}}
These pensions were not awarded on grounds of justice, contract or socio-economic merits, but as a political decision, in order to take a politically significant person and/or his dynasty (often deemed a potential political danger) out of the picture by paying him or her off, regardless of seniority. 

In the history of the [[British Empire]], the term applies to the following overseas native former ruling houses of [[princely state]]s who saw their feudal territories annexed by the [[East India Company]] before it transferred power in [[British India]] to [[the Crown]] in 1858.

Although politically important members could be relocated or exiled, they retained throughout India and until the end of the [[British Raj|Raj]] a hereditary right to their former princely rank and titles (in several cases including a [[gun salute]]) as well as a monetary "political pension" in the form of a [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse]]. Only a few years after India's independence in 1947, the nationalist government of the Indian Union 'persuaded' most of these princely heirs to relinquish their annual pensions on so-called patriotic grounds. For those who continued to receive the payments, the sums were reduced to a pittance through not compensating for inflation.

Muslim pensioners :
* the imperial [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] family, [[Paramount ruler]] of India as [[Padshah-i-Hind]], in or near Delhi (pension discontinued after 1857)
* the heirs of its failed Muslim fundamentalist challenger, [[Tippu Sultan]]'s Mysore-based [[Khudadad]] empire 
* the [[Prince of Arcot]] (formerly Nawab Subadar of the Realm of the Carnatic)
* the [[Nawab of Awadh]] (Oudh), formerly the Mughal emperor's hereditary prime Minister 
* the Nawab of [[Kurnool]] 
* the [[Nawab of Masulipatam]], head of a younger branch of the [[nawabs of Banganapalle]]
* the [[Nawab of Murshidabad]] (in fact the dynasty of the former Nawab Nazim of greater [[Bengal]]; in West Bengal)
* the [[Nawab of Surat]]

Seven Hindu thrones, at least three held by the Rajput Bhonsle family :
* the Maharaja of [[Assam]] (not the whole present constitutive state) 
* the Maharaja of [[Nagpur]] 
* the Raja of [[Kolaba State|Kolaba]], Angria (Angre) dynasty
* the Raja of [[Satara State|Satara]], had even earlier lost all real power to his chief minister, the [[Peshwa]], who had become the hegemon of the [[Maratha Empire|Mahratta confederation]]
* the Raja of [[Tanjore]]
* the Raja of [[Kodagu|Coorg]] 
* the Peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy (pension discontinued 1857)

Only one Sikh pensioner : 
* [[Sikh Empire|Punjab]]'s last ruling Maharajah, [[Duleep Singh]].

== Other ==
Similar 'golden cage' arrangements were often made later by other (not only British) governments. An extreme case was the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], for whom the Italian island of [[Elba]] was turned into an operetta 'empire' until his escape, Cent Jours revolt and miserable banishment to St. Helena.

{{Monarchism |expanded=concepts}}
A '''monarch''' is a sovereign [[head of state]] in a [[monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=monarch | website=Oxford Dictionaries | url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/monarch?q=monarch | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webster"&gt;Webster's II New College Dictionary.[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/monarch?q=monarch Monarch]. Houghton Mifflin. Boston. 2001. p. 707. {{ISBN|0-395-96214-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the [[Sovereign state|state]], or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Usually a monarch either personally [[inheritance|inherits]] the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as ''the throne'' or ''[[the Crown|the crown]]'') or is [[elective monarchy|selected]] by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, [[acclamation]] or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns [[Life tenure|for life]] or until [[abdication]]. 

If a young child is crowned the monarch, a [[regent]] is often appointed to govern until the monarch reaches the requisite adult age to rule. Monarchs' actual powers vary from one monarchy to another and in different eras; on one extreme, they may be [[autocracy|autocrats]] ([[absolute monarchy]]) wielding genuine sovereignty; on the other they may be [[Ceremony|ceremonial]] [[head of state|heads of state]] who exercise little or no direct power or only [[reserve power]]s, with actual [[authority]] vested in a [[parliament]] or other body ([[constitutional monarchy]]).

A monarch can reign in multiple monarchies simultaneously. For example, the [[monarchy of Canada]] and the [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]] are separate states, but they share the same monarch through [[personal union]].

==Characteristics==
Monarchs, as such, bear a variety of titles – [[king]] or [[Queen regnant|queen]], [[prince]] or [[princess]] (e.g., [[Sovereign Prince of Monaco]]), [[emperor]] or [[Emperor|empress]] (e.g., [[Emperor of China]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], [[Emperor of Japan]], [[Emperor of India]]), [[archduke]], [[duke]] or [[grand duke]] (e.g., [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]), [[emir]] (e.g., [[Emir of Qatar]]), [[sultan]] (e.g., [[Sultan of Oman]]), or a [[pharaoh]]. ''Prince'' is sometimes used as a generic term to refer to any monarch regardless of title, especially in older texts.&lt;ref name="pine"&gt;{{cite book | title=Titles: How the King became His Majesty | publisher=Barnes  &amp; Noble | author=[[L.G. Pine|Pine, L.G.]] | year=1992 | location=New York | page=[https://archive.org/details/titleshowkingbec0000pine/page/86 86] | isbn=978-1-56619-085-5 | url=https://archive.org/details/titleshowkingbec0000pine/page/86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A king can also be a queen's husband, and a queen can be a king's wife. If both of the couple reigns, neither person is generally considered to be a consort. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}
[[Monarchy]] is political or sociocultural in nature, and is generally (but not always) associated with [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary rule]]. Most monarchs, both historically and in the present day, have been born and brought up within a [[royal family]] (whose rule over a period of time is referred to as a [[dynasty]]) and trained for future duties. Different systems of [[Order of succession|succession]] have been used, such as [[proximity of blood]] (male preference or absolute), [[primogeniture]], [[agnatic seniority]], [[Salic law]], etc. While traditionally most monarchs have been male, female monarchs have also ruled, and the term [[queen regnant]] refers to a ruling monarch, as distinct from a [[queen consort]], the wife of a reigning king.

Some monarchies are non-hereditary. In an [[elective monarchy]], the monarch is [[election|elected]] but otherwise serves as any other monarch. Historical examples of elective monarchy include the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s (chosen by [[prince-elector]]s, but often coming from the same dynasty) and the [[royal elections in Poland|free election]] of kings of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Modern examples include the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]], who is appointed by the [[Conference of Rulers]] every five years or after the king's death, and the [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who serves as sovereign of the [[Vatican City|Vatican City State]] and is elected to a life term by the [[College of Cardinals]].

In recent centuries, many states have abolished the monarchy and become [[republic]]s (however see, e.g., [[United Arab Emirates#Government and politics|United Arab Emirates]]). Advocacy of government by a republic is called [[republicanism]], while advocacy of monarchy is called [[monarchism]]. A principal advantage of hereditary monarchy is the immediate continuity of national leadership, as illustrated in the classic phrase "[[:The King is dead. Long live the King.|The [old] King is dead. Long live the [new] King!]]". In cases where the monarch serves mostly as a ceremonial figure (e.g. most modern constitutional monarchies), real leadership does not depend on the monarch.

A form of government may, in fact, be hereditary without being considered a monarchy, such as a [[family dictatorship]].

==Classification==
Monarchies take a wide variety of forms, such as the two [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|co-princes of Andorra]], positions held simultaneously by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Urgel (Spain) and the elected [[President of France]] (although strictly Andorra is a [[diarchy]]). Similarly, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of [[Malaysia]] is considered a monarch despite only holding the position for five years at a time.

Hereditary succession within one [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] family has been most common (although, see the [[Rain Queen]]), with a preference for children over siblings, sons over daughters. In Europe, some peoples practiced equal division of land and regalian rights among sons or brothers, as in the Germanic states of the Holy Roman Empire, until after the [[medieval era]] and sometimes (e.g., [[Ernestine duchies]]) into the 19th century. Other European realms practice one form or another of [[primogeniture]], whereunder a [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son or, if he had none, by his brother, his daughters or sons of daughters.

The system of [[tanistry]] was semi-elective and gave weight also to ability and merit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The [[Salic law]], practiced in France and in the Italian territories of the [[House of Savoy]], stipulated that only men could inherit the crown. In most [[fief]]s, in the event of the demise of all legitimate male members of the [[patrilineality|patrilineage]], a female of the family could succeed (semi-Salic law). In most realms, daughters and sisters were eligible to succeed a ruling kinsman before more distant male relatives (male-preference primogeniture), but sometimes the husband of the heiress became the ruler, and most often also received the title, ''[[jure uxoris]]''. Spain today continues this model of succession law, in the form of [[cognatic primogeniture]]. In more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood|proximity]] and [[primogeniture]] battled, and outcomes were often idiosyncratic.

As the average life span increased, the eldest son was more likely to reach majority age before the death of his father, and primogeniture became increasingly favored over proximity, tanistry, seniority, and election.

In 1980, [[Sweden]] became the first monarchy to declare ''equal primogeniture'', ''absolute primogeniture'' or ''full cognatic primogeniture'', meaning that the eldest child of the monarch, whether female or male, ascends to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations have since adopted this practice: [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, and [[Luxembourg]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15489544|title=Overturning centuries of royal rules|date=28 October 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://luxtimes.lu/archives/29500-new-ducal-succession-rights-for-grand-duchy|title=New Ducal succession rights for Grand Duchy|website=luxtimes.lu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] adopted absolute (equal) primogeniture on April 25, 2013, following [[Perth Agreement|agreement by the prime ministers of the sixteen Commonwealth Realms]] at the 22nd Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

In some monarchies, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], succession to the throne usually first passes to the monarch's next eldest brother and so on through his other brothers, and only after them to the monarch's children (''agnatic seniority''). In some other monarchies (e.g. [[Jordan]]), the monarch chooses who will be his successor within the royal family, who need not necessarily be his eldest son.

Whatever the rules of succession, there have been many cases of a monarch being overthrown and replaced by a usurper who would often install his own family on the throne.

===Monarchs in Africa===
{{Further|Monarchies in Africa}}
[[File:RamsesIIEgypt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ramesses II]], the third [[Pharaoh]] of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt]]]]
A series of [[Pharaoh]]s ruled [[Ancient Egypt]] over the course of three millennia (circa 3150 BC to 31 BC) until it was conquered by the [[Roman Empire]]. In the same time period several kingdoms flourished in the nearby [[Nubia]] region, with at least one of them, that of the so-called [[A-Group]] culture, apparently influencing the customs of Egypt itself. From the 6th to 19th centuries, Egypt was variously part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], Islamic Empire, [[Mamluk]] Sultanate, [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[British Empire]] with a distant monarch. The [[Sultanate of Egypt]] was a short-lived protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] from 1914 until 1922 when it became the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and Sultan [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] changed his title to King. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] the monarchy was dissolved and Egypt became a republic.

[[West Africa]] hosted the [[Kanem Empire]] (700–1376) and its successor, the [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] principality which survives to the present day as one of the [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional states]] of [[Nigeria]].
[[File:Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shire 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mohamoud Ali Shire]], the 26th Sultan of the [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali]] Warsangali Sultanate]]
In the [[Horn of Africa]], the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and later the [[Zagwe Dynasty]], [[Ethiopian Empire]] (1270–1974), and [[Aussa Sultanate]] were ruled by a series of monarchs. [[Haile Selassie]], the last Emperor of Ethiopia, was deposed in a [[communist]] [[coup]]. Various [[Somali aristocratic and court titles|Somali Sultanates]] also existed, including the [[Adal Sultanate]] (led by the [[Walashma dynasty]] of the [[Ifat Sultanate]]), [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]], [[Ajuran Sultanate]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Geledi Sultanate]], [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] and [[Sultanate of Hobyo]].

[[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]] were largely isolated from other regions until the modern era, but they did later feature kingdoms like the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] (1400–1914).

The [[Zulu people]] formed a powerful [[Zulu Kingdom]] in 1816, one that was subsequently absorbed into the [[Colony of Natal]] in 1897. The [[List of Zulu kings|Zulu king]] continues to hold a hereditary title and an influential cultural position in contemporary South Africa, although he has no direct political power. Other tribes in the country, such as the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and the [[Tswana people|Tswana]], have also had and continue to have a series of kings and chiefs whose local precedence is recognised, but who exercise no legal authority.

As part of the [[Scramble for Africa]], Europeans conquered, bought, or established African kingdoms and styled themselves as monarchs due to them.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Currently, the African nations of [[Morocco]], [[Lesotho]], and [[Eswatini|Eswatini (Swaziland)]] are sovereign monarchies under dynasties that are native to the continent. Places like [[St. Helena]], [[Ceuta]], [[Melilla]] and the [[Canary Islands]] are ruled by the [[Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] or the [[King of Spain]]. So-called "sub-national monarchies" of varying sizes can be found all over the rest of the continent, e.g. the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] city-state of [[Akure Kingdom|Akure]] in south-western [[Nigeria]] is something of an elective monarchy: its reigning [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] having to be chosen by an electoral college of nobles, from amongst a finite collection of royal princes of the realm.

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] different titles were used by nobles exercising various degrees of sovereignty within their borders (see below). Such titles were granted or recognised by the Emperor or Pope. Adoption of a new title to indicate sovereign or semi-sovereign status was not always recognized by other governments or nations, sometimes causing [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] problems.

During the nineteenth century many small monarchies in Europe merged with other territories to form larger entities, and following [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], many [[Monarchy abolishment|monarchies were abolished]], but of those remaining all except Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Andorra, Vatican City, and Monaco were headed by a king or queen.

{{As of|2015}} in Europe there are twelve monarchies: seven [[monarchy|kingdom]]s ([[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]]), one [[grand duchy]] ([[Luxembourg]]), one [[papacy]] ([[Vatican City]]), and two [[principalities]] ([[Liechtenstein]] and [[Monaco]]), as well as one [[diarchy]] principality ([[Andorra]]).

In China, before the abolition of the monarchy in 1912, the [[Emperor of China]] was traditionally regarded as the ruler of "[[Tianxia|All under heaven]]". "King" is the usual translation for the term ''wang'' 王, the sovereign before the [[Qin dynasty]] and during the [[Ten Kingdoms]] period. During the early [[Han dynasty]], China had a number of kingdoms, each about the size of a [[province]] and subordinate to the Emperor.
In Korea, ''Daewang'' (great king), or ''Wang'' (king), was a Chinese royal style used in many states rising from the dissolution of [[Gojoseon]], [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]], [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], [[Silla]] and [[Balhae]], [[Goryeo]], [[Joseon]]. The legendary [[Dangun]] Wanggeom founded the first kingdom, Gojoseon. Some scholars maintain that the term ''Dangun'' also refers to a title used by all rulers of Gojoseon and that ''Wanggeom'' is the proper name of the founder. ''Gyuwon Sahwa'' (1675) describes The Annals of the Danguns as a collection of nationalistic legends. The monarchs of Goguryeo and some monarchs of Silla used the title "[[Taewang]]", meaning the "Great king". The early monarchs of Silla have used the title of "Geoseogan", "Chachaung", "Isageum", and finally "Maripgan" until 503. The title "Gun" (prince) can refer to the dethroned rulers of the Joseon dynasty as well. Under the [[Korean Empire]] (1897–1910), the rulers of Korea were given the title of "Hwangje", meaning the "Emperor". Today, Members of the Korean Imperial Family continue to participate in numerous traditional ceremonies, and groups exist to preserve Korea's imperial heritage.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The [[Imperial House of Japan|Japanese monarchy]] is now the only monarchy to still use the title of [[Emperor]].

In modern history, between 1925 and 1979, Iran was ruled by two Emperors from the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] that used the title of "Shahanshah" (or "King of Kings"). The last Iranian Shahanshah was King [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], who was forced to abdicate the throne as a result of a revolution in Iran. In fact Persian (Iranian) kingdom goes back to about 2,700 BC (see [[Kings of iran#Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC)|List of Kings of Persia]]), but reached its ultimate height and glory when King [[Cyrus the Great]] (Known as "The Great Kourosh" in Iran) started the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid dynasty]], and under his rule, the [[Empire]] embraced all the previous civilized states of [[Ancient Near East|the ancient Near East]], expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of [[Southwest Asia]] and much of [[Central Asia]] and the Caucasus. From the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Hellespont]] in the west to the [[Indus River]] in the east, Cyrus the Great created the largest empire the world had yet seen.

[[Thailand]] and Bhutan are like the United Kingdom in that they are constitutional monarchies ruled by a King. [[Jordan]] and many other Middle Eastern monarchies are ruled by a [[Malik]] and parts of the [[United Arab Emirates]], such as [[Dubai]], are still ruled by monarchs.

[[Saudi Arabia]] is the largest Arab state in Western Asia by land area and the second-largest in the Arab world (after Algeria). It was founded by [[Ibn Saud|Abdul-Aziz bin Saud]] in 1932, although the conquests which eventually led to the creation of the Kingdom began in 1902 when he captured [[Riyadh]], the ancestral home of his family, the [[House of Saud]]; succession to the throne was limited to sons of Ibn Saud until 2015, when [[Muhammad bin Nayef|a grandson]] was elevated to Crown Prince. The Saudi Arabian government has been an absolute monarchy since its inception, and designates itself as [[Islamic]]. The King bears the title "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques" in reference to the two holiest places in Islam: [[Masjid al-Haram]] in [[Mecca]], and [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] in [[Medina]].

[[Oman]] is led by Monarch Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said Al Said]]. The [[Kingdom of Jordan]] is one of the [[Middle East]]'s more modern monarchies is also ruled by a [[Malik]]. In Arab and Arabized countries, [[Malik]] (absolute King) is the absolute word to render a monarch and is superior to all other titles. [[Nepal]] abolished their monarchy in 2008. [[Sri Lanka]] had a complex system of monarchies from 543BC to 1815. Between 47BC-42BC Anula of Sri Lanka became the country's first female head of state as well as Asia's first head of state.{{dubious|date=September 2010}}

In [[Malaysia]]'s constitutional monarchy, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (The Supreme Lord of the Federation) is ''de facto'' rotated every five years among the nine Rulers of the Malay states of Malaysia (those nine of the thirteen states of Malaysia that have hereditary royal rulers), elected by ''Majlis Raja-Raja'' ([[Conference of Rulers]]).

Under [[Brunei]]'s 1959 constitution, the [[Sultan of Brunei]] is the head of state with full executive authority, including emergency powers, since 1962. The Prime Minister of Brunei is a title held by the Sultan. As the prime minister, the Sultan presides over the cabinet.

[[Cambodia]] has been a kingdom since the 1st century. The power of the absolute monarchy was reduced when it became the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia]] from 1863 to 1953. It returned to an absolute monarchy from 1953 until the establishment of a republic following the [[Cambodian coup of 1970|1970 coup]]. The monarchy was restored as a constitutional monarchy in 1993 with the king as a largely symbolic figurehead.

In the [[Philippines]], the [[History of the Philippines (900–1521)|pre-Colonial]] [[Filipino people|Filipino]] nobility, variously titled the ''harì'' (today meaning "king"), ''[[Lakan]]'', ''[[Raja]]'' and ''[[Datu]]'' belonged to the caste called ''Uring [[Maharlika]]'' (Noble Class). When the islands [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|were annexed]] to the [[Spanish Empire]] in the late 16th century, the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarch]] became the sovereign while local rulers often retained their prestige as part of the [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianised]] nobility called the ''[[Principalía]]''. After the [[Spanish–American War]], the country was ceded to the United States of America and made into a territory and eventually a [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]], thus ending monarchism. While the Philippines is currently a republic, the [[Sultanate of Sulu|Sultan of Sulu]] and [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Sultan of Maguindanao]] retain their titles only for ceremonial purposes but are considered ordinary citizens by the [[1987 Constitution]]. [[Bhutan]] has been an independent kingdom since 1907. The first [[Druk Gyalpo]] (''Dragon King'') was elected and thereafter became a hereditary absolute monarchy. It became a constitutional monarchy in 2008.

[[Tibet]] was a monarchy since the [[Tibetan Empire]] in the 6th century. It was ruled by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] following the Mongol invasion in the 13th century and became an effective [[diarchy]] with the [[Dalai Lama]] as co-ruler. It came under the rule of the Chinese [[Qing Dynasty]] from 1724 until 1912 when it gained de facto independence. The [[Dalai Lama]] became an absolute temporal monarch until [[incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China]] in 1951.

[[Nepal]] was a monarchy for most of its history until becoming a federal republic in 2008.

The concept of monarchy existed in the Americas long before the arrival of European colonialists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carsten-rex.de/History/history.html Canada: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219053336/http://www.carsten-rex.de/History/history.html |date=2007-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macleans.ca/switchboard/article.jsp?content=20031027_68038_68038 Ferguson, Will; ''The Lost Kingdom''; ''Macleans'', October 27, 2003] {{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Europeans arrived they referred to these tracts of land within territories of different aboriginal groups to be kingdoms, and the leaders of these groups were often referred to by the Europeans as Kings, particularly hereditary leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/mi4/polcrt/4Chiefs.html|title=Courtly Lives - Four Indian Kings|website=www.angelfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-colonial titles that were used included:
* [[Cacique]] – Aboriginal [[Hispaniola]] and [[Borinquen]]
* [[Tlatoani]] – [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]s
* [[Ajaw]] – [[Maya civilization|Maya]]
* [[Qhapaq Inka]] – [[Inca Empire|Tawuantin Suyu]] (Inca Empire)
* Morubixaba – [[Tupi people|Tupi]] tribes
* Sha-quan – King of the world used in some Native American tribes

The first local monarch to emerge in North America after colonization was [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who declared himself [[First Haitian Empire|Emperor of Haiti]] on September 22, 1804. Haiti again had an emperor, [[Faustin I of Haiti| Faustin I]] from 1849 to 1859. In South America, Brazil&lt;ref&gt;L Gomes. 1889: como um imperador cansado, um marechal vaidoso e um professor injustiçado contribuíram para a o fim da monarquia e programação da republica no Brasil. Globo Livros. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; had a royal house ruling as emperor between 1822 and 1889, under Emperors [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] and [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]].

Between 1931 and 1983 nine other previous British colonies attained independence as kingdoms. All, including Canada, are in a [[personal union]] relationship under a shared monarch. Therefore, though today there are legally ten American monarchs, one person occupies each distinct position.

In addition to these sovereign states, there are also a number of sub-national ones. In [[Bolivia]], for example, the [[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|Afro-Bolivian king]] claims descent from an African dynasty that was taken from its homeland and sold into slavery. Though largely a ceremonial title today, the position of ''king of the Afro-Bolivians'' is officially recognized by the government of Bolivia.

[[Polynesia]]n societies were ruled by an ''[[ariki]]'' from ancient times. The title is variously translated as "supreme chief", "paramount chief" or "king".

The [[Kingdom of Tahiti]] was founded in 1788. Sovereignty was ceded to [[France]] in 1880 although descendants of the [[Pōmare Dynasty]] claim the title of King of Tahiti.

The [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was established in 1795 and overthrown in 1893.

An independent [[Kingdom of Rarotonga]] was established in 1858. It became a protectorate of the [[United Kingdom]] at its own request in 1893.

[[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] ruled the short-lived [[Kingdom of Fiji]], a constitutional monarchy, from 1871 to 1874 when he voluntarily ceded sovereignty of the islands to the [[United Kingdom]]. After independence in 1970, the [[Dominion of Fiji]] retained the British monarch as head of state until it became a republic following a [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|military coup in 1987]].

[[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] (including the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]]), [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Tuvalu]] are sovereign states within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] that currently have [[Elizabeth II]] as their reigning constitutional monarch.

The [[Pitcairn Islands]] are part of the [[British Overseas Territories]] with [[Elizabeth II]] as the reigning constitutional monarch.

[[Tonga]] is the only remaining sovereign kingdom in Oceania. It has had a monarch since the 10th century and became a constitutional monarchy in 1875. In 2008, King [[George Tupou V]] relinquished most of the powers of the monarchy and the position is now largely ceremonial.

In [[New Zealand]] the position of [[Māori King Movement|Māori King]] was established in 1858. The role is largely cultural and ceremonial and has no legal power.

[[Wallis Island|Uvea]], [[Alo (Wallis and Futuna)|Alo]] and [[Sigave]] in the [[France|French]] territory of [[Wallis and Futuna]] have non-sovereign elective monarchs.

==Titles and precedence in Europe==
{{unsourced-section|date=July 2019}}
{{For|commonly used names for specific monarchs|List of monarchs by nickname}}

The usage and meaning of a monarch's specific title have historically been defined by tradition, law and diplomatic considerations.

Note that some titles borne by monarchs have several meanings and may not exclusively designate a monarch. A [[Prince]] may be a [[prince du sang|person of royal blood]] (some languages uphold this distinction, see [[Fürst]]). A [[Duke]] may belong to a [[peerage]] and hold a dukedom (title) but no duchy (territory). In [[Imperial Russia]], a [[Grand Duke]] was a son or patrilineal grandson of the [[Tsar]] or [[Tsarina]]. Holders of titles in these alternative meanings did not enjoy the same status as monarchs of the same title.

Within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], there were numerous titles used by noblemen whose authority within their territory sometimes approached [[sovereignty]], even though they acknowledged the Holy Roman Emperor as [[suzerain]]; [[Prince-elector|Elector]], [[Grand Duke]], [[Margrave]], [[Landgrave]] and [[Count Palatine]], as well as secular princes like kings, dukes, princes and "princely counts" (''Gefürstete Grafen''), and ecclesiastical princes like Prince-Archbishops, [[Prince-bishop|Prince-Bishops]] and Prince-Abbots. A ruler with a title below emperor or king might still be regarded as a monarch, outranking a nobleman of the same ostensible title (e.g., [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]], a reigning sovereign, and his younger brother, [[Claude, Duke of Guise]], a nobleman in the [[peerage of France]]).

The table below lists titles in approximate [[order of precedence]]. According to [[protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] any holder of a title indicating sovereignty took precedence over any non-sovereign titleholder.

As senior ruler in Medieval Christendom, the Pope held precedence over all other titles and offices. The Papacy is a celibate office always forbidden to women; in English however, reports of female popes such as ([[Pope Joan]]) refer to them as ''pope'' and ''[[Popess (disambiguation)|Popess]]''; the term is used, among other things, for the second trump in the [[Tarot]] deck''; some European languages also have a feminine form of the word pope, such as the Italian ''papessa'', the French ''papesse'', the Portuguese/Spanish ''papisa'' and the German ''Päpstin''.

==Use of titles by non-sovereigns==
It is not uncommon that people who are not generally seen as monarchs nevertheless use monarchical titles. There are at least five cases of this:
* [[Pretender|Claiming an existing title]], challenging the current holder. This has been very common historically. For centuries, the [[British monarchy|British monarch]] used, among his other titles, the title [[King of France]], despite the fact that he had had no authority over mainland French territory since the sixteenth century. Other cases include the numerous [[antipope]]s who have claimed the [[Holy See]].
* Retaining the title of an [[extinct monarchy]]. This can be coupled with a claim that the monarchy was in fact never, or should never have been, extinct. An example of the first case is the [[Seborga|Prince of Seborga]]. Examples of the second case are several [[List of monarchs who lost their thrones or abdicated in the 20th century|deposed monarchs]] or otherwise pretenders to thrones of abolished monarchies, e.g., [[Leka, Crown Prince of Albania (born 1982)|Leka, Crown Prince of Albania]] who is styled by some as the "King of The Albanians". Retaining the title of an extinct monarchy can, however, be totally free of claims of sovereignty, for example it was customary in numerous European monarchies to include "[[King of Jerusalem]]" in their full titles. When it comes to deposed monarchs, it is customary to continue the usage of their monarchical title (e.g., [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II, King of the Hellenes]]) as a [[courtesy title]], not a constitutional position, for the duration of their lifetime. However the title then dies with them and is not used by subsequent heirs or claimants unless the crown is restored constitutionally. Monarchs who have ''freely'' [[abdicate]]d are sometimes addressed by a lesser style (although, see [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] and [[Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg]]. However, where a monarch abdicated under duress (e.g., [[Michael I of Romania]]), it is usual (especially outside their former realm) to continue to use their monarchical style for their lifetime as a traditional courtesy.
* Inventing a new title. This is common among founders of [[micronation]]s, and also may or may not come with a claim of sovereignty, not usually [[Diplomatic recognition|recognised abroad]]. A notable example is [[Paddy Roy Bates]], styling himself the "Prince of Sealand", but not recognized as such by any national government, thus failing at least the [[constitutive theory of statehood|constitutive condition for statehood]] (see [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]] for a fuller discussion of his claims). Another known example is that of [[Emperor Norton|Norton I]], who invented the title "Emperor of the United States of America" and later declared himself "Protector of Mexico".
* Usage of a monarchical title by a fictional character. This is common in [[fairy tale]]s and other works geared to children, as well as works of [[fantasy]]. Examples include [[Princess Leia]] and [[Princess Summerfall Winterspring]].
* [[Honorific nicknames in popular music]] and other aspects of popular culture, such as "King of Rock and Roll", [[Count Basie]] or [[Emperor Norton]].

'''World domination''' (also called '''global domination''' or '''world conquest''' or '''cosmocracy''') is a hypothetical [[power structure]], either achieved or aspired to, in which a single political authority holds the power over all or virtually all the inhabitants of the planet [[Earth]]. Various individuals or regimes have tried to achieve this goal throughout history, without ever attaining it.
The theme has been often used in works of [[fiction]], particularly in [[political fiction]], as well as in [[conspiracy theories]] (which may posit that some person or group has already secretly achieved this goal), particularly those fearing the development of a "[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]" involving a [[world government]] of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] nature.&lt;ref name="Camp 1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Camp, Gregory S.|title=Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-Times Paranoia|publisher=Commish Walsh|year=1997|asin=B000J0N8NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlet and Lyons 2000"&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Chip Berlet|Berlet Chip]]; Lyons, Matthew N.|title=Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort|url=https://archive.org/details/rightwingpopulis00berlrich|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2000|isbn=1-57230-562-2|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg 2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldberg, Robert Alan|title=Enemies Within: The Culture of Conspiracy in Modern America|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-300-09000-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/enemieswithincul00gold_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barkun, Michael|title=[[A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America]]|publisher=University of California Press; 1 edition|year=2003|isbn=0-520-23805-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenster 2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fenster, Mark|title=Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture|publisher=University of Minnesota Press; 2nd edition|year=2008|isbn=0-8166-5494-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and political ideologies==
{{main|World government}}
[[File:Achaemenid Empire (flat map).svg|thumb|right|By 500 BC, [[Darius the Great]] had created the largest empire up until that time, but it was still only a fraction of the land and people of the Earth.]]

Historically, world domination has been thought of in terms of a [[nation]] expanding its power to the point that all other nations are subservient to it. This may be achieved by establishing a [[hegemony]], an indirect form of government and of imperial dominance in which the ''hegemon'' (leader state) rules geopolitically subordinate states by means of its implied power—by the threat of force, rather than by direct military force. However, domination can also be achieved by direct military force. In the 4th century BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] notably expressed a desire to conquer the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Green|first=Peter| authorlink=Peter Green (historian)| year=2007| title= Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age|page= 23|publisher=Phoenix|location=London| isbn=978-0-7538-2413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a legend persists that after he completed his military conquest of the known [[ancient world]], he "wept because he had no more worlds to conquer",&lt;ref&gt;Eric Donald Hirsch, William G. Rowland, Michael Stanford, ''The New First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'' (2004), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; as he was unaware of China farther to the east and had no way to know about civilizations in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bruun, Millicent Haines, ''The World Story'' (1963), p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the full size and scope of the world known, it has been said that "world domination is an impossible goal", and specifically that "no single nation however big and powerful can dominate a world" of well over a hundred interdependent nations and billions of people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Atlantic Community Quarterly]]'' (1979), Volume 17, p. 287. At the time, the source specified that there were about 140 nations and about four billion people.&lt;/ref&gt;

An opposite view was expressed by [[Hans Morgenthau]]. He stressed that the mechanical development of weapons, transportation, and communication makes "the conquest of the world technically possible, and they make it technically possible to keep the world in that conquered state." He argues that a lack of such infrastructure explains why great ancient empires, though vast, failed to complete universal conquest of their world and perpetuate the conquest. "Today no technological obstacle stands in the way of a world-wide empire," as "modern technology makes it possible to extend the control of mind and action to every corner of the globe regardless of geography and season."&lt;ref&gt;[[Politics Among Nations|Politics Among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace]], 4th edition, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1967, pp. 358–365.&lt;/ref&gt; Morgenthau continued on the technological progress:
{{quote|
It has also given total war that terrifying, world-embracing impetus which seems to be satisfied with nothing less than world dominion... The machine age begets its own triumphs, each forward step calling forth two or more on the road of technological progress. It also begets its own victories, military and political; for with the ability to conquer the world and keep it conquered, it creates the will to conquer it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Politics Among Nations]], pp. 369–370.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Earlier, impressed with the swift opening of World War II, Derwent Whittlesey wrote in 1942:
{{quote|
The swift march of conquest stunned or dazzled the onlookers... The grandiose concept of the world domination became possible as a practical objective only with the rise of science and its application to mechanical invention. By these means the earth’s scattered land units and territories became accessible and complementary to each other, and for the first time the [[world state]], so long a futile medieval ideal, became a goal that might conceivably be reached.&lt;ref&gt;Derwent Whittlesey, ''German Strategy of World Conquest'', (Essex: F. E. Robinson &amp; Co, 1942), p 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Yet before the entrance of the United States into this War and with Isolationism still intact, US strategist [[Hanson W. Baldwin]] projected:
{{quote|
Tomorrow air bases may be the highroad to power and domination... Obviously it is only by air bases ... that power exercised in the sovereign skies above a nation can be stretched far beyond its shores... Perhaps... future acquisitions of air bases ... can carry the voice of America through the skies to the ends of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson W. Baldwin, ''United We Stand! Defense of the Western Hemisphere'', (New York &amp; London: Whittlesey House, 1941), p 189, 222.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the early 17th century, Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] proposed that world domination could be achieved through control of the [[ocean]]s, writing that "whosoever commands the sea commands the [[trade]]; whosoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world, and consequently the world itself".&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], "A Discourse of the Invention of Ships, Anchors, Compass, &amp;c.", ''The Works of Sir Walter Ralegh, Kt.'' (1829, reprinted 1965), vol. 8, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, [[Halford John Mackinder]] offered another influential theory for a route to world domination, writing:

:"Who rules [[Eastern Europe|East Europe]] commands the [[The Geographical Pivot of History#The World-Island and the Heartland|Heartland]]:&lt;br&gt;Who rules the Heartland commands the [[Afro-Eurasia|World-Island]]:&lt;br&gt;Who rules the World-Island commands [[Earth|the World]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Halford John Mackinder]], ''Democratic Ideals and Reality: A Study in the Politics of Reconstruction'' (1919), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of ideologies ([[anarchism]], [[communism]], [[fascism]], [[Nazism]], and [[capitalism]]) actively pursue the goal of establishing a form of government consistent with their political beliefs, or assert that the world is moving "naturally" towards the adoption of a particular form of government (or self), authoritarian or anti-authoritarian. These proposals are not concerned with a particular nation achieving world domination, but with all nations conforming to a particular social or economic model. A goal of world domination can be to establish a [[world government]], a single common political authority for all of humanity. The period of the [[Cold War]], in particular, is considered to be a period of intense ideological polarization, given the existence of two rival blocs—the capitalist [[Western Bloc|West]] and the communist [[Eastern Bloc|East]]—that each expressed the hope of seeing the triumph of their ideology over that of the enemy. The ultimate end of such a triumph would be that one ideology or the other would become the sole governing ideology in the world.

In certain [[religion]]s, some adherents may also seek the [[Religious conversion|conversion]] (peaceful or [[Forced conversion|forced]]) of as many people as possible to their own religion, without restrictions of national or ethnic origin. This type of spiritual domination is usually seen as distinct from the temporal dominion, although there have been instances of efforts begun as [[holy war]]s devolving into the pursuit of wealth, resources, and territory. Some [[Christianity|Christian]] groups teach that a false religion, led by [[false prophet]]s who achieve world domination by inducing nearly universal worship of a [[False god|false deity]], is a prerequisite to [[end time]]s described in the [[Book of Revelation]]. As one author put it, "[i]f world domination is to be obtained, the masses of little people must be brought on board with religion".&lt;ref&gt;Buddy Selman, ''Because God Made a Promise to Abraham'' (2011), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, speakers have accused nations or ideological groups of seeking world domination, even where those entities have denied that this was their goal. For example, [[J. G. Ballard]] quoted [[Aldous Huxley]] as having said of the United States entering the [[First World War]], "I dread the inevitable acceleration of American world domination which will be the result of it all...Europe will no longer be Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[[J.

'''Global policeman''' is an informal term for a [[State (polity)|state]] which seeks or claims [[global hegemony]].{{according to whom?|date=April 2018}} It has been used, firstly for the [[United Kingdom]] and, since 1945, of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Colley]], 'Britain and the US once ran the world. Now they're all at sea', ''[[The Guardian]]'', 14 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Rachman]], 'The world would miss the American policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'', 2 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the two terms ''hegemon'' and ''global policeman'' are not identical in meaning.  The former term defines capacity for dominant control anywhere on earth, whereas the latter may also include small or large areas ''outside control'', along with monitoring and attempted enforcements, but does not define any level of effectiveness.

In recent years there has been speculation that [[China]] may take over the role&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"&gt;[[Jonas Parello-Plesner]] and [[Parag Khanna]], 'Stop fretting about Beijing as a global policeman', ''[[Financial Times]]'',  28 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as it reaches out to protect [[shipping lanes]], protect its overseas workers and interests, and 'creeps into the superpower league'. The [[Western world|West]], according to two columnists of the ''[[Financial Times]]'', 'should view this as an opportunity, not a threat.'&lt;ref name="Stop fretting"/&gt;

==In international law==
{{Further|Westphalian sovereignty}}
No formal recognition of this position exists. Theoretically, in [[international law]], all nations are equal; '[[par in parem non habet imperium]]', no authority between equals, is the principle applied. In reality, international law is decentralised, unpoliced, unenforceable, unclear and frequently broken. States are [[Sovereign state#Ontological status of the state|'immortal' and cannot be indicted]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Wight]], [[Power Politics (Wight book)]], 1978, p 98- 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with state policing==

Within [[Sovereign state|states]], law restrains and limits power; between states, the opposite is true.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wight, Power Politics, 1978 , p 102&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Peelian principles]] of policing include: the duty to prevent crime, keep the peace and uphold the law, with the consent of the public, and with minimal use of force and restraint; to act impartially; and not to usurp the powers of the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Reith]], A new study of police history, Oliver and Boyd, 1956, appendix.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter standard requires a [[presumption of innocence]]. Candidates for police recruitment and promotion are appointed on merit, whereas a 'global policeman' is self-appointed faute de mieux.

Within states, a [[monopoly on violence]] is the norm; the police may carry weapons, but few others do so (the US is an exception, prompting [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles Lane]] to ask if it is 'really a state'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-the-us-who-has-the-monopoly-on-force/2016/07/13/fbcd45da-490d-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html 'In the US, who has the  monopoly on force?'], [[Washington Post]], 13 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) Internationally, a 'global policeman' is but one heavily armed state among two hundred others.

To confer the  role of 'global policeman' on any self-interested, expansionary state implies a [[conflict of interest]]. States wage war with maximum force; engage in arms sales; form alliances and thus lack impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the 'world police' analogy gets wrong,' [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The comparatively peaceful years 1815–1914 came to be known as [[Pax Britannica]]. The UK made efforts to end the [[Slave trade]] through the [[West Africa Squadron]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk&gt;pdf&gt;britain-and-the-trade.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, Britain, jointly with France and Russia, intervened on the side of [[Greek independence]], destroying the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]]. In 1854, Britain, jointly with France, prevented Russia from destroying the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Russia had to withdraw from [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]], and [[Sevastopol]] was besieged in the [[Crimean war]].

From 1914–1945 no one state was hegemonic, with [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] power decreasing, but still very much leading, world role, and with rising powers such as the United States, the [[Empire of Japan]], and later [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. In an era of [[multipolarity]] and [[diffused responsibility]], fascist dictators arose and Europe sank into two world wars. The authoritarian German challenge to democratic Britain then, is comparable to the authoritarian Chinese challenge to democratic America now, according to [[Richard J Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;'Before the first world war: what can 1914 tell us about 2014?' [[New Statesman]], 23/1/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 promised assistance to anticommunist allies. 'The right of neutrality was abolished...it was an era of aggressive peacetime policy which marked the beginning of America's role as global policeman.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Wendy McElroy]], 'How America became the World's Policeman', [[The Daily Bell]], 19/3/2015&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]] 'The enemy is terrorism not communism'.&lt;ref&gt;ibid,&lt;/ref&gt; But after a disastrous intervention in [[Somalia]] in 1993, the US was reluctant to engage in [[humanitarian intervention]] in [[Bosnia]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Connor Murphy]], 'World Police Force?' psu.edu, 31/10/2013&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Baldauf]], 'Why the US didn't intervene in the Rwandan massacre', [[Christian Science Monitor]] 7/4/2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US-led [[Invasion of Iraq]], officially a policing mission to find [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]], has been accused of being an illegal cover for ulterior, unethical motives: the need to secure US regional bases, oil supplies, and the loyalty of key allies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Norton-Taylor]], 'Top judge: US and UK acted as vigilantes in Iraq invasion, Guardian, 17/11/2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Usborne]], 'WMD just an excuse for war, admits Wolfowitz', Independent, 29/5/2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, serious doubts have been raised about the validity of US overseas intervention and destabilization in Iraq, Libya and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tariq Ali]], 'America's selective vigilantism will make as many enemies as friends', [[The Guardian]], 6/9/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nathan Gardels]] and [[Hans Blix]], 'America is not the world's policeman - in Syria or Iraq', [[Christian Science Monitor]], 27/8/2013&lt;/ref&gt; As the 21st century progresses, the morality of global policing itself is increasingly in question, with the inevitable loss of self-determination by nations in which intervention occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel L Davis]], 'What the World Police Analogy gets wrong', [[The National Interest]], 2/10/2016&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, with the advent of non-state threats to global security, prior legal justifications such as general '[[law of war|laws of war]]' are of questionable jurisdiction.

[[File:Statement von GS Kyrle zur Befreiung der Jemen Geiseln (8724149668).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Public figures use [[press conference]]s so often as a way to control the timing and specificity of their messages to the media that press conference facilities have been nicknamed "[[spin room]]s".]]
In [[public relations]] and [[politic]]s, '''spin''' is a form of [[propaganda]], achieved through knowingly 
providing a biased interpretation of an event or campaigning to influence [[public opinion]] about some organization or public figure. While traditional public relations and [[advertising]] may manage their presentation of facts, "spin" often implies the use of [[Wikt:disingenuous|disingenuous]], [[deceptive]], and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] tactics.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Safire]], "[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/22/magazine/the-spinner-spun.html The Spinner Spun]", ''New York Times'', December 22, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of the frequent association between spin and [[press conference]]s (especially [[government]] press conferences), the room in which these conferences take place is sometimes described as a "[[spin room]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Powell. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/us/politics/22scene.html "Tit for Tat on a Night Where Spin Is Master,"] ''New York Times.'' February 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations advisors, pollsters and media [[consultant]]s who develop deceptive or misleading messages may be referred to as "'''spin doctors'''" or "'''spinmeisters'''".

A standard tactic used in "spinning" is to reframe or modify the perception of an issue or event to reduce any negative impact it might have on public opinion. For example, a company whose top-selling product is found to have a significant safety problem may "reframe" the issue by criticizing the safety of its main competitor's products or by highlighting the risk associated with the entire product category. This might be done using a "catchy" [[slogan]] or [[sound bite]] that can help to persuade the public of the company's biased [[point of view (philosophy)|point of view]]. This tactic could enable the company to refocus the public's attention away from the negative aspects of its product. {{cn|date=June 2017}}

Spinning is typically a service provided by paid media advisors and media [[consultant]]s. The largest and most powerful companies may have in-house employees and sophisticated units with expertise in spinning issues. While spin is often considered to be a private-sector tactic, in the 1990s and 2000s some politicians and political staff were accused of using deceptive "spin" tactics to manipulate or deceive the public. Spin may include "burying" potentially negative new information by releasing it at the end of the workday on the last day before a long weekend; selectively [[cherry-picking]] quotes from previous speeches made by their employer or an opposing politician to give the impression that they advocate a certain position; or purposely [[News leak|leaking]] [[misinformation]] about an opposing politician or candidate that casts them in a negative light.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaber|first=Ivor|date=1999|title=Government by spin: an analysis of the process|journal=Contemporary Politics|volume=5|issue=3|pages=263–275|doi=10.1080/13569779908450008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Rise of political spin ===
[[Edward Bernays]] has been called the "Father of Public Relations". Bernays helped [[tobacco]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] companies make consumption of their products more socially acceptable, and he was proud of his work as a propagandist.&lt;ref&gt;Stauber, John and Sheldon Rampton. [http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1999Q2/bernays.html "Book Review: ''The Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays &amp; The Birth of PR'' by Larry Tye,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121185416/http://www.prwatch.org/prwissues/1999Q2/bernays.html |date=2008-11-21 }} ''PR Watch'' (Second Quarter 1999). Vol. 6, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1990s, the use of spin by politicians and parties accelerated, especially in the United Kingdom; the emergence of 24-hour news increased pressures placed upon journalists to provide nonstop content, which was further intensified by the competitive nature of British broadcasters and newspapers, and content quality declined due to 24-hour news' and political parties' techniques for handling the increased demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Nicholas|date=2003|title=24-hours media|journal=Journal of Public Affairs|volume=3|issue=1|pages=27–31|doi=10.1002/pa.130}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to journalists relying more heavily on the public-relations industry as a source for stories, and advertising revenue as a profit source, making them more susceptible to spin.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sOkcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR10&amp;dq=Mass+media+politics+and+democracy#v=onepage&amp;q=Mass%20media%20politics%20and%20democracy&amp;f=false|title=Mass media, politics and democracy|last=Street|first=John|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=9781137015556|location=Basingstoke|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin in the United Kingdom began to break down with the high-profile resignations of the architects of spin within the [[New Labour]] government, with [[Charlie Whelan]] resigning as [[Gordon Brown]]’s spokesman in 1999 and [[Alastair Campbell]] resigning as [[Tony Blair]]’s Press Secretary in 2003.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaber|first=Ivor|date=2004|title=Alastair Campbell, exit stage left: Do the "Phillis" recommendations represent a new chapter in political communications or is it "business as usual"?|journal=Journal of Public Affairs|volume=4|issue=4|pages=365–373|doi=10.1002/pa.199}}&lt;/ref&gt; As information technology has increased since the end of the 20th century, commentators like [[Joe Trippi]] have advanced the theory that modern [[Internet activism]] spells the end for political spin, in that the Internet may reduce the effectiveness of spin by providing immediate counterpoints.&lt;ref&gt;Branigan, Tania, "[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/13/newmedia.egovernment Internet spells end for political spin, says US web guru]", ''[[The Guardian]]''. 12 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of "spin doctors" ===
“Spin doctors” can either command media attention or remain anonymous. Examples from the UK include [[Jamie Shea]] during his time as '''[[NATO]]'''’s press secretary throughout the [[Kosovo War]], Charlie Whelan, and Alastair Campbell.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Campbell, previously a journalist before becoming Tony Blair’s Press Secretary, was the driving force behind a government that was able to produce the message it wanted in the media. He played a key role in important decisions, with advisors viewing him as a ‘Deputy Prime Minister’ inseparable from Blair.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=he15AAAAIAAJ|title=Alastair Campbell: New Labour and the rise of the media class|last=Oberne|first=Peter|publisher=Aurum|year=1999|isbn=9781854106476|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell trusted various journalists such as [[Anthony Bevins|Tony Bevins]] and [[Denis Murray (journalist)|Denis Murry]], with whom he had a close relationship, to write stories about Blair in a positive light; Campbell identifies how he was able to spin [[Rupert Murdoch]], during a meeting in July 1995, into positively reporting an up incoming Blair speech, gathering the support from ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|the Sun]]'' and ''[[the Times]]'', popular British newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QlMMhKCUfIMC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=The+Blair+Years#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Blair%20Years&amp;f=false|title=The Blair years: extracts from the Alastair Campbell diaries|last=Campbell|first=Alastair and|last2=Scott|first2=Richard|publisher=Hutchinson|year=2007|isbn=9780099514756|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell later acknowledged that his and the government's spinning had contributed to the electorate's growing distrust of politicians, and he asserted that spin must cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Alastair|date=2002|title=It's time to bury spin|journal=British Journal Review|volume=13|issue=4|pages=15–23|doi=10.1177/095647480201300403}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

“Spin doctors” such as Shea praised and respected Campbell’s work. In 1999, during the beginning of NATO’s intervention in Kosovo, Shea’s media strategy was non-existent before the arrival of Campbell and his team. Campbell taught Shea how to organise his team to deliver what he wanted to be in the media, which led to Shea being appreciated for his work by President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Techniques ==
Some spin techniques include:
*[[File:Picking Cherries.jpg|alt=Cherry picking as a farming and a public relations practice.|thumb|Cherry picking is a practice of using selective facts to present to the public. It refers to the farming practice of picking only ripe cherries. ]]Selectively presenting facts and quotes that support one's position ("[[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]]"). For example, a pharmaceutical company could choose only two trials where their product shows a positive effect and ignore hundreds of unsuccessful trials, or a politician's staff could handpick short speech quotations from past years which appear to show their candidate's support for a certain position.
* [[Non-denial denial]]
* [[Non-apology apology]]
* "[[Mistakes were made]]" is an example of [[distancing language]], commonly used as a rhetorical device, whereby a speaker acknowledges that a situation was managed inappropriately but evades any direct responsibility. The expression focuses on the action, omitting any actor, via the [[English passive voice|passive voice]], and "mistakes" are framed in an indirect sense that does not imply intent. A less evasive [[active voice]] construction would focus on the actor, such as: "I made mistakes" or "John Doe made mistakes." 
* Speaking in a way that [[Begging the question|assumes unproven claims]] or [[avoiding the question|avoids the question]]&lt;ref&gt;Staff. "[https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/are-these-examples-of-political-spin/7265.html Are these examples of political spin?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815015401/http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningzone/clips/are-these-examples-of-political-spin/7265.html |date=2012-08-15 }}". ''[[BBC Learning Zone]]''. Clip 7265. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Burying bad news": announcing unpopular things when the media is expected to be focusing on other news. In some cases, governments have released potentially controversial reports on summer long weekends. Sometimes "other news" is deliberately supplied.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Misdirection and diversion&lt;ref name=weissman&gt;Weissman, Jerry. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jerry-weissman/spin-versus-topspin_b_218103.html Spin vs. Topspin]". ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. 19 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This is when a government leaks a story to the news to limit the coverage of a more damaging story that has been circulating. New Labour used this tactic to reduce the coverage of Foreign Secretary [[Robin Cook]]'''’'''s affair. This was achieved by leaking a story that a previous Governor of Hong Kong was under investigation by MI6.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Limited hangout]]
*Rewarding good journalists with stories. During the Rhodesia crisis [[Harold Wilson]] formulated a list of journalists that he trusted to write stories that aligned with the government’s opinion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Preventing access to journalists or broadcasters that are reporting to the disliking of the spin doctor. An example is [[The World at One|the ''World at One'']] being ignored by New Labour in the build up to the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 General election]] due to an interview they held with Blair that asked difficult questions, leading to interviews being handed to other stations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

For years, businesses have used fake or misleading [[Testimonial#Customer testimonials|customer testimonials]] by editing/spinning customers to reflect a much more satisfied experience than was actually the case. In 2009, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] updated their laws to include measures to prohibit this type of "spinning" and have been enforcing these laws as of late.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2009/10/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials|title=FTC Publishes Final Guides Governing Endorsements, Testimonials|date=2009-10-05|website=Federal Trade Commission|language=en|access-date=2019-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on elections ==
The extent of “spin doctors’” impact is contested, though their presence is still recognized in the political environment. The 1997 General election saw a landslide victory for New Labour with a 10.3% swing from [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], with help from newspapers such as ''the Sun'' towards which Campbell focused his spinning tactics as he greatly valued their support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zi5dDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=The+Labour+Party:+continuity+and+change+in+the+making+of+%E2%80%98New%E2%80%99+Labour.#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Labour%20Party%3A%20continuity%20and%20change%20in%20the%20making%20of%20%E2%80%98New%E2%80%99%20Labour.&amp;f=false|title=The Labour Party: continuity and change in the making of 'New' Labour|last=Fielding|first=Steven|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2002|isbn=9781403940445|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous newspaper headline ‘The Sun Backs Blair’ was a key turning point in the campaign which provided New Labour with a lot of confidence and hope of increased electoral support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/18/past.roygreenslade|title=It's the Sun wot's switched sides back to Blair|last=Greensalde|first=Roy|date=1997|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in political alignment had an impact on the electorate, with the amount of individuals voting for Labour that read switching newspapers rising by 19.4%, compared to only 10.8% by those that did not read switching newspapers; a study conducted by Ladd and Lenz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ladd|first=Jonathan M. and|last2=Lenz|first2=Gabriel S.|date=2009|title=Exploiting a Rare Communication Shift to Document the Persuasive Power of the News Media|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=53|issue=2|pages=394–410|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hypodermic needle model''' (known as the '''hypodermic-syringe model''', '''transmission-belt model''', or '''magic bullet theory''') is a model of [[communication]] suggesting that an intended message is directly received and wholly accepted by the receiver. The model was originally rooted in 1930s [[behaviourism]] and largely considered obsolete for a long time, but [[big data]] analytics-based [[mass customisation]] has led to a modern revival of the basic idea.

==Concept==
The "Magic Bullet" or "Hypodermic Needle Theory" of direct influence effects was based on early observations of the effect of mass media, as used by [[Nazi propaganda]] and the effects of [[Hollywood]] in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Communication Theory; Mass Communication: MAGIC BULLET OR HYPODERMIC NEEDLE THEORY OF COMMUNICATION http://communicationtheory.org/magic-bullet-or-hypodermic-needle-theory-of-communication/&lt;/ref&gt; People were assumed to be "uniformly controlled by their biologically based 'instincts' and that they react more or less uniformly to whatever 'stimuli' came along".&lt;ref&gt;Lowery, Shearon (1995). ''Milestones in Mass Communication Research: Media Effects'' (en inglés). USA: Longman Publishers. p. 400. {{ISBN|9780801314377}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Magic Bullet" theory graphically assumes that the media's message is a bullet fired from the "media gun" into the viewer's "head".&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Asa (1995). Essentials of Mass Communication Theory. Londres: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "Hypodermic Needle Model" uses the same idea of the "shooting" paradigm. It suggests that the media injects its messages straight into the passive audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;D. Croteau, W. Hoynes (1997). ''Media/society: industries, images, and audiences''. Pine Forge Press. {{ISBN|9780803990654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This passive audience is immediately affected by these messages. The public essentially cannot escape from the media's influence, and is therefore considered a "sitting duck".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Both models suggest that the public is vulnerable to the messages shot at them because of the limited communication tools and the studies of the media's effects on the masses at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, D.K. &amp; Baron, S.J. (1981). ''A History of Our Understanding of Mass Communication''. Belmont: Wadsworth Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; It means the media explores information in such a way that it injects in the mind of audiences as bullets.

The "magic bullet" and "hypodermic needle" models originate from [[Harold Lasswell]]'s 1927 book, ''Propaganda Technique in the World War''.&lt;ref&gt;Lasswell, H. (1927) "Propaganda Technique in the World War"&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work in the history of communication studies have documented how the two models may have served as strawman theory or fallacy&lt;ref&gt;Lubken, Deborah. (2008). Remembering the Straw Man: The Travels and Adventures of Hypodermic. In D. W. Park &amp; J. Pooley (Eds.), The history of media and communication research: contested memories: Peter Lang Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; or even a "myth".&lt;ref&gt;Sproule, J. M. (1989). Progressive Propaganda Critics and the Magic Bullet Myth. Critical Studies in Mass Communication, 6(3), 225-246. doi:citeulike-article-id:9472331&lt;/ref&gt; Others have documented the possible medical origins of the metaphor of the magic bullet model.&lt;ref&gt;Thibault, Ghislain. (2016). Needles and Bullets: Media Theory, Medicine, and Propaganda, 1910-1940. In K. Nixon &amp; L. Servitje (Eds.), Endemic: Essays in Contagion Theory (pp. 67-91). Basingstoke: [[Palgrave Macmillan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-step flow==
{{main|Two-step flow of communication}}
The phrasing "hypodermic needle" is meant to give a mental image of the direct, strategic, and planned infusion of a message into an individual. But as research methodology became more highly developed, it became apparent that the media had selective influences on people.

The most famous incident often cited as an example for the hypodermic needle model was the 1938 broadcast of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' and the subsequent reaction of widespread panic among its [[United States|American]] mass audience. However, this incident actually sparked the research movement, led by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] and [[Herta Herzog]], that would disprove the magic bullet or hypodermic needle theory, as [[Hadley Cantril]] managed to show that reactions to the broadcast were, in fact, diverse, and were largely determined by situational and attitudinal attributes of the listeners.

In the 1940s, Lazarsfeld disproved the "magic bullet" theory and "hypodermic needle model theory" through elections studies in "The People's Choice".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Felix Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, Hazel Gaudet (1948). ''The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign''. Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Lazarsfeld and colleagues executed the study by gathering research during the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The study was conducted to determine voting patterns and the relationship between the media and political power. Lazarsfeld discovered that the majority of the public remained unfazed by propaganda surrounding Roosevelt's campaign. Instead, interpersonal outlets proved more influential than the media. Therefore, Lazarsfeld concluded that the effects of the campaign were not all powerful to the point where they completely persuaded "helpless audiences", a claim that the Magic Bullet, Hypodermic Needle Model, and Lasswell asserted. These new findings also suggested that the public can select which messages affect and don't affect them.

Lazarsfeld's debunking of these models of communication provided the way for new ideas regarding the media's effects on the public. Lazarsfeld introduced the idea of the [[two-step flow of communication]]&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' [[Two-step flow model]]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1944. [[Elihu Katz]] contributed to the model in 1955 through studies and publications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, E.]], [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Lazarsfeld, P.F.]] (1955) ‘Personal influence: The part played by people in the flow of mass communications‘, The Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The model of the two-step flow of communication assumes that ideas flow from the mass media to opinion leaders and then to the greater public. They believed the message of the media to be transferred to the masses via this [[opinion leadership]]. Opinion leaders are categorized as individuals with the best understanding of media content and the most accessibility to the media as well. These leaders essentially take in the media's information, and explain and spread the media's messages to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1957|title=The Two-Step Flow of Communication: An Up-To-Date Report on an Hypothesis|doi=10.1086/266687|journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]|volume=21|issue=1|pages=61–78|last1=Katz|first1=Elihu|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1279&amp;context=asc_papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the two step flow model and other communication theories suggest that the media does not directly have an influence on viewers anymore. Instead, interpersonal connections and even [[selective exposure]] play a larger role in influencing the public in the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Joseph Severin, James W. Tankard (1979). ''Communication Theories: Origins, Methods, Uses''. Hastings House. {{ISBN|9780803812741}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary one-step flow==
More recently, the use of [[big data]] analytics to identify user preferences and to send tailor-made messages to individuals led back to the idea of a "one-step flow of communication", which is in principle similar to the hypodermic needle model.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, W. L., &amp; Manheim, J. B. (2006). The One-Step Flow of Communication. The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 608(1), 213–232. http://doi.org/10.1177/0002716206292266&lt;/ref&gt; The difference is that today's massive databases allow for the [[mass customization]] of messages. So it is not one generic [[mass media]] message, but many individualized messages, coordinated by a massive algorithm. For example, [[empirical studies]] have found that in [[Twitter]] networks, traditional mass media outlets receive 80–90% of their Twitter mentions directly through a direct one-step flow from average Twitter users.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"&gt;Hilbert, M., Vasquez, J., Halpern, D., Valenzuela, S., &amp; Arriagada, E. (2016). [http://doi.org/10.1177/0894439316639561 One Step, Two Step, Network Step? Complementary Perspectives on Communication Flows in Twittered Citizen Protests]. [[Social Science Computer Review]]. Freely available at http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0nn4p7mv&lt;/ref&gt; However, these same studies also argue that there is a multitude of step-flow models at work in today's digital communication landscape.&lt;ref name="HilbertTwostep"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Choi, S. (2014). The Two-Step Flow of Communication in Twitter-Based Public Forums. Social Science Computer Review, 0894439314556599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stansberry, K. (2012).

{{Communication}}
{{Performing arts}}
'''Public speaking''' (also called '''oratory''' or '''oration''') is the process or act of performing a [[Speech communication|speech]] to a live [[audience]]. Public speaking is commonly understood as formal, face-to-face speaking of a single person to a group of listeners.&lt;ref&gt;''General Purposes of Speaking''. 2012books.lardbucket.org. Retrieved 2016-11-04.{{ISBN needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, public speaking was considered to be a part of the art of persuasion. The act can accomplish particular purposes including to inform, to persuade, and to entertain. Additionally, differing methods, structures, and rules can be utilized according to the speaking situation. 

Public speaking was developed in Rome, Greece, and Latin America. Prominent thinkers from these lands influenced the development and evolutionary history of public speaking. Currently, technology continues to transform the art of public speaking through newly available technology such as videoconferencing, multimedia presentations, and other nontraditional forms.

==Uses==
Public speaking can serve the purpose of transmitting information, telling a story, motivating people to act or encouraging people. This type of speech is deliberately structured with three general purposes: to inform, to persuade and to entertain.  Knowing when public speaking is most effective and how it is done properly are key to understanding the importance of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Choices &amp; Connections: An Introduction to Communication|last=McCornack and Ortiz|first=Steven and Joseph|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public speaking for business and commercial events is often done by professionals. These speakers can be contracted independently, through representation by a [[speakers bureau]], or by other means. Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world. In fact, it is believed that 70 percent of all jobs involve some form of public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Lisa.

However, the most significant records are found among the ancient Greeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first known piece&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, James J.  [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demosthenes-Greek-statesman-and-orator "Demosthenes – greatest Greek orator".] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; on oratory, written over 2,000 years ago, came from [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greece]]. This work elaborated on principles drawn from the practices and experiences of ancient Greek orators. [[Aristotle]] was one who first recorded the teachers of oratory to use definitive rules and models. His emphasis on oratory led to oration becoming an essential part of a [[liberal arts]] education during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. The [[classical antiquity]] works written by the ancient Greeks capture the ways they taught and developed the art of public speaking thousands of years ago.

In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], [[rhetoric]] was the main component of [[Composition studies|composition]] and speech delivery, both of which were critical skills for citizens to use in public and private life. In ancient Greece, citizens spoke on their own behalf rather than having professionals, like modern lawyers, speak for them. Any [[citizen]] who wished to succeed in court, in politics or in social life had to learn techniques of public speaking. Rhetorical tools were first taught by a group of rhetoric teachers called [[Sophists]] who were notable for teaching paying students how to speak effectively using the methods they developed.

Separately from the Sophists, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]  developed their own theories of public speaking and taught these principles to students who wanted to learn skills in rhetoric. Plato and Aristotle taught these principles in schools that they founded, [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]] and [[Aristotles Lyceum|The Lyceum]], respectively. Although Greece eventually lost political sovereignty, the Greek culture of training in public speaking was adopted almost identically by the Romans.

===Rome===

In the political rise of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman orators copied and modified the ancient Greek techniques of public speaking. Instruction in rhetoric developed into a full curriculum, including instruction in grammar (study of the poets), preliminary exercises ([[progymnasmata]]), and preparation of public speeches (declamation) in both [[Forensic linguistics|forensic]] and [[Deliberative rhetoric|deliberative]] genres.

The Latin style of rhetoric was heavily influenced by [[Cicero]] and involved a strong emphasis on a broad education in all areas of [[Humanities|humanistic study]] in the liberal arts, including philosophy. Other areas of study included the use of wit and humor, the [[Pathos|appeal to the listener's emotions]], and the use of [[digression]]s. Oratory in the [[Roman empire]], though less central to political life than in the days of the Republic, remained significant in law and became a big form of entertainment. Famous orators became like celebrities in ancient Rome—very wealthy and prominent members of society.

The Latin style was the primary form of oration until the beginning of the 20th century. After [[World War II]], however, the Latin style of oration began to gradually grow out of style as the trend of ornate speaking was seen as impractical. This cultural change likely had to do with the rise of the [[scientific method]] and the emphasis on a "plain" style of speaking and writing. Even formal oratory is much less ornate today than it was in the Classical Era.

==Historical speeches==
{{seealso|List of speeches}}

Despite the shift in style, the best-known examples of strong public speaking are still studied years after their delivery. Among these examples are:
*[[Pericles' Funeral Oration]] in 427 BCE addressing those who died during the [[Peloponnesian War]]
*Abraham Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] in 1863
*Sojourner Truth's identification of racial issues in "[[Ain't I a Woman?]] 
*Mahatma Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance in India, which in turn inspired Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech at the Washington Monument in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;German, Kathleen M. (2010). ''Principles of Public Speaking''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-205-65396-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women and public speaking==
{{Tone|section|date=December 2018}}
Throughout the 18th and 19th century, women were banned to speak publicly in the courtroom, the senate floor, and the pulpit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Reader's Companion to U.S. Women's History|last=Mankiller|first=Wilma Pearl|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=978-0585068473|location=|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780618001828}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed|date=December 2018}} It was also considered improper for women to be heard in a public setting. {{citation needed|date=March 2019}} An exception to this custom was the [[Quakers|Quaker]] religion that allowed women to speak publicly in meetings of the church. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Suffrage to the Senate: America's Political Women |last=O'Dea |first=Suzanne|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=978-1-61925-010-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed|date=December 2018}}

[[Frances Wright]] was known as one of the first female public speakers of the United States. She advocated for equal education for women and men through large audiences and through the press.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Pages needed|date=December 2018}} African American [[Maria Stewart]], also said to be the second female speaker of the United States, lectured in Boston in front of both men and women just 4 years after Wright in 1832 and 1833 on educational opportunities and abolition for young girls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Pages needed|date=December 2018}}

Two sisters named [[Angelina Grimké]] and [[Sarah Grimké]] created a platform for public lectures to women. They were the first female agents of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Both sisters also had many tours through the years 1837 and 1839, which was only 5 years after Maria Stewart. The two sisters faced disagreement by churches that did not agree with their public speaking as women {{citation needed|date=March 2019}}. Both sisters spoke about how slavery relates to women's' rights and why women need equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bizzell|first=Patricia|date=2010|title=Chastity Warrants for Women Public Speakers in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction|url=|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|volume= 40 |page=17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques and trainings==

Effective public speaking can be developed by joining a club such as [[Australian Rostrum|Rostrum]], [[Toastmasters International]], [[Association of Speakers Clubs]] (ASC), or [[Speaking Circles]], in which members are assigned exercises to improve their speaking skills. Members learn by observation and practice, and hone their skills by listening to constructive suggestions followed by new public speaking exercises. These include:
* Oratory
* The use of [[Body language|gestures]]
* Control of the [[voice]] ([[inflection]])
* [[Vocabulary]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]], word choice
* Speaking notes, pitches
* Using [[humor]]
* Developing a relationship with the audience
* "Show of Hands Method" (used primarily for [[Billboard]] presentations)
* Extemporaneous and Enthusiastic Delivery
* Effective Introduction
*Efforts to Reach Hearts
*Effective use of questions
The new millennium has seen a notable increase in the number of training solutions offered in the form of video and online courses. Videos can provide actual examples of behaviors to emulate. Professional public speakers often engage in ongoing training and education to refine their craft. This may include seeking guidance to improve their speaking skills such as learning better storytelling techniques, learning how to effectively use humour as a communication tool, and continuously researching in their topic area of focus.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Glossophobia==
{{seealso|Glossophobia}}
A common fear of public speaking is called [[glossophobia]] (or, informally, "stage fright"), this state of response by many beginners confuse with normal nerves and anxiety with a genuine phobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2018-06-04|website=psycom.net|title=Glossophobia (Fear of Public Speaking): Are You Glossophobic?|first=Rosemary|last=Black|url=https://www.psycom.net/glossophobia-fear-of-public-speaking|accessdate=2019-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern==

===Technology===
[[File:Ettus Ted Talk 1.png|thumb|200px|Ettus Ted Talk]]
New technology has also opened different forms of public speaking that are nontraditional such as TED Talks,&lt;ref&gt;[[TED (conference)]]&lt;/ref&gt; which are conferences that are broadcast globally. This form of public speaking has created a wider audience base because public speaking can now reach both physical and virtual audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Talk Like TED: The 9 Public-Speaking Secrets of the World's Top Minds|last=Gallo|first=Carmine|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1466837270|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These audiences can be watching from all around the world. [[YouTube]] is another platform that allows public speaking to reach a larger audience. On YouTube, people can post videos of themselves. Audiences are able to watch these videos for all types of purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TED Talks: The Official TED Guide to Public Speaking|last=Anderson|first=Chris|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multimedia presentations can contain different video clips, sound effects, animation, laser pointers, remote control clickers and endless bullet points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Guide to Business School Presenting: What your professors don't tell you... What you absolutely must know|last=Ridgley|first=Stanley K.|publisher=Anthem Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All adding to the presentation and evolving our traditional views of public speaking.

Public speakers may use [[audience response systems]]. For large assemblies, the speaker will usually speak with the aid of a [[public address system]] or [[microphone]] and [[loudspeaker]].

These new forms of public speaking, which can be considered nontraditional, have opened up debates about whether or not these forms of public speaking are actually public speaking. Many people consider TED Talks and YouTube broadcasting to not be true forms of public speaking because there is not a  real, physical audience. Others argue that public speaking is about getting a group of people together in order to educate them further regardless of how or where the audience is located {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.

===Telecommunication===
[[Telecommunication]] and [[videoconferencing]] are also forms of public speaking. David M. Fetterman of [[Stanford University]] wrote in his 1997 article ''Videoconferencing over the Internet'': "Videoconferencing technology allows geographically disparate parties to hear and see each other usually through satellite or telephone [[communication]] systems." This technology is helpful for large conference meetings and face-to-face communication between parties without demanding the inconvenience of travel.

===Notable modern theorists===
*[[Harold Lasswell]] developed [[Lasswell's model of communication]]. There are five basic elements of public speaking that are described in this theory: the communicator, message, medium, audience and effect. In short, the speaker should be answering the question "''who'' says ''what'' in which ''channel'' to ''whom'' with what ''effect''?"

      <text bytes="3161" xml:space="preserve">An '''action alert''' is a message that an organization sends to mobilize people, often members of the group and supporters of a specific point of view, calling on them to take action to influence public policy.&lt;ref name="one hour"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=nN3RMP-BcnkC ''The one-hour activist: the 15 most powerful actions you can take to fight for the issues and candidates you care about''] Christopher Kush, John Wiley and Sons, 2004; {{ISBN|0-7879-7300-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7879-7300-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cyber"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhRh1LH8tOMC ''Cybercitizen: How to Use Your Computer to Fight for All the Issues You Care about''] Christopher Kush, Macmillan, 2000; {{ISBN|0-312-26305-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-312-26305-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, action alerts are in reference to a timely issue, where prompt action is needed in order to affect upcoming decisions.&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt;

==Description==
Action alerts are considered a cost-effective and efficient grassroots organizing tool and are employed widely by many advocacy organizations.&lt;ref name="one hour"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt; A well-designed action alert can be a "powerful way to invite people to participate in the processes of a democracy."&lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=v5H1-i6LHu0C ''The Nonprofit Manager's Resource Directory''], Ronald A. Landskroner, John Wiley and Sons, 2001; {{ISBN|0-471-39242-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-471-39242-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Action alerts may, for instance, ask supporters to:
*Contact their legislator to highlight the issue or argue for/against proposed legislation; or
*Write a [[letter to the editor]] about a specific item in the news.
Action alerts commonly begin by explaining the public policy issue to the recipients, and then tell the reader how they can impact the decision. Action alerts go by many other names. [[Amnesty International]], for instance, refers to them as "Urgent actions".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ua-index-eng |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403121614/http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ua-index-eng |archivedate=2005-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political journalism''' is a broad branch of [[journalism]] that includes coverage of all aspects of [[politics]] and [[political science]], although the term usually refers specifically to coverage of civil [[government]]s and [[political power]].

Political journalism aims to provide voters with the information to formulate their own opinion and participate in community, local or national matters that will affect them. According to Edward Morrissey in an opinion article from theweek.com, political journalism frequently includes opinion journalism, as current political events can be biased in their reporting. The information provided includes facts, its perspective is subjective and leans towards one viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrissey|first1=Edward|title=The election is not rigged against Trump. But the media is biased against the GOP.|url=http://theweek.com/articles/655596/election-not-rigged-against-trump-but-media-biased-against-gop|website=the week.com|date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brendan Nyhan and John Sides argue that "Journalists who report on politics are frequently unfamiliar with political science research or question its relevance to their work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Sides|first2=John|title=How Political Science can help journalism (and still let journalists be journalists)|journal=The Forum|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1|doi=10.2202/1540-8884.1426|url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/poli-sci-journalism.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists covering politics who are unfamiliar with information that would provide context to their stories can enable the story to take a different spin on what is being reported.

Political journalism is provided through different mediums, in print, broadcast, or online reporting. Digital media use has increased and it provides instant coverage of campaign, politics, event news and an accessible platform for the candidate. Media outlets known for their political journalism like ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'', have increased their use of this medium as well. Printed, online, and broadcast political humor presented as entertainment has been used to provide updates on aspects of government status, political news, campaign, and election updates. According to Geoffrey Baym, the information provided may not be considered "fake news" but the lines between entertainment and factual news may seem blurred or biased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baym|first1=Geoffrey|title=The Daily Show: Discursive Integration and the Reinvention of Political Journalism|journal=Political Journalism Journal|date=2005|pages=259–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; while providing political updates. This type of journalism is analyzed, interpreted, and discussed by news media pundits and editorialists. It can lack objectivity which can prevent the accuracy of the presented information. The reporting of news with a bias view point can also take away the audience's ability to form their own opinion or beliefs of what has been reported. This type of reporting is subjective with a possible social or political purpose.

== Overview ==
Civic journalism has began to develop a strong following again after first emerging as a philosophy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Those who find civic journalism to be a new, progressive, and profound method for the media to engage with the public see it as an opportunity to revitalize democracy as we know it. As technological advances overtake the modern world, it is becoming less common for the general public to buy newspapers or watch TV news to inform themselves on the events in the political sphere. Including this, younger generations, such as Generation X, Generation Y, and even Millennials, are not coming out to the polls due to a variety of reasons. Overall, democracy is beginning to fail as there is a lack of civic engagement and even interference with democratic processes, such as Russia's involvement with the 2016 United States election, and even electronic voting (e-voting) machines that are being hacked and altering results. All in all, proponents of civic journalism believe that for democracy to regain its traction and glory in the modern world, the media must be more receptive to feedback from the public and take initiative to engage the public as well.

According to Oxford Research Encyclopedias,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strömbäck|first=Jesper|last2=Shehata|first2=Adam|date=2018-09-26|title=Political Journalism|url=https://oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-859|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Communication|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.859|isbn=9780190228613}}&lt;/ref&gt; the popularity of political journalism is rising, and the area is becoming one of the more dominant domains of journalism. Political journalism is meant to be more of an overseer of democratic process as they relate to civic engagement rather than a scapegoat for the issues with democracy. Including this, there are four key concepts that political journalism can be boiled down to. These concepts are the framing of politics as a strategic game, interpretive versus straight news, conflict framing and media negativity, and finally, political or partisan bias. In essence, these can be viewed as the four quintessential pillars of civic journalism.

== Goals ==
The goal of civic journalism, or public journalism, is to allow the community to remain engaged with journalists and news outlets, restore democratic values, and rebuild the public's trust in journalists. The concept of fake news arose due to the fact that it is so easy to manipulate or twist information these days and create a certain narrative that might be entirely incorrect. This has led to an overall decrease in the credibility that people have for journalists and media sources. Certain media sources or news outlets often come under a lot of heat for certain stories or narrative they push which are built upon fallacies. People argue for participatory democracy, but politics now is largely considered a popularity contest, and consists of politicians making decisions to ensure their reelection. Proponents of civic journalism believe that this philosophy will allow individuals to have a greater say in decision-making and in the broader political sphere.

Given the rise in yellow journalism and search optimization algorithms that create an echo-chamber among mass-media, civic journalism is entering a niche role where it can shift the position of news within public reception. As of recent, most news publishers undergo more and more observation as their ethics and content come under extensive scrutiny for political biases. In a time where traditional news outlets concern themselves with how to effectively monetize and are not the main distributors of information, civic journalism pivots the role of publishers from distributing information to curating information. Given one of civic journalism's central tenets - making the press a forum for discussion of community issues - a publisher is able to seek out a niche in bolstering local engagement over spreading knowledge of worldly issues readily available via a web search.

== Proponents and Opponents ==
According to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Journalism and Mass Communications,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unlcms.unl.edu/journalism2/cojmc/alumni/jnews/archive/96_winter/civic.html|title=Journalists disagree on how to connect with public|last=White|first=Heidi|date=|website=University of Nebraska-Lincoln Website|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; civic journalism is a polarizing philosophy and has a collection of opponents as well. These opponents of civic journalism find it to be risky and ineffective. Including this, they find the practice to bring about conflicts of interest, and believe it necessitates involvement into public affairs that is deemed unethical. John Bender, assistant professor of new editorial at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, claimed that journalists who are the most esteemed and high regarded play active roles in helping their community thrive. This practice would be an example of how civic journalism is indeed beneficial for the future of democracy as proponents believe.

Proponents of civic journalism are steadfast on certain issues. They believe integrating journalism into the democratic process would help inform voters and make them more aware of what is occurring in the political sphere. Including this, it could make a difference in the democratic process if all voters were equally informed. An important aspect is ensuring that the information received by the public is all accurate and fact-checked. This is an important aspect that sometimes gives journalism, and certain news sources, a bad reputation, as previously mentioned. Accuracy in political news and journalism can enable voters to be more involved in the democratic process. Civic journalism itself is the process of integrating journalism into the democratic process and allowing voters and the media to play a more active role rather than being witnesses and bystanders in what happens in the political sphere. Moreover, technology also plays an active role in educating voters and determining viewpoints.

==Subsets==
* '''Election journalism''' or '''electoral journalism''' is a subgenre of political journalism which focuses upon and analyzes developments related to an approximate election and political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mundoelectoral.com/html/index.php?id=504|title=Towards an electoral journalism|first=Jorge|last=Bravo|journal=Mundo Electoral - Electoral World|volume=3|issue=8|date=May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402102625/http://www.mundoelectoral.com/html/index.php?id=504|archivedate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of journalism provides information to the electorate that can educate and help form opinion that empowers a specific vote. This subgenre, like data journalism, makes use of numerical data, such as statistics, polls and historic data in regards to a candidate's chance of success for office, or a party's change in size in a legislature. It provides knowledge that may make the presented news hold more relevance. Information added to the reports are of campaign statuses and political events. A politician's strategy can be exaggerated or provided without context or historical perspective. Trends on each party candidate are reported and at times compared to previous party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyhan|first1=Brendan|last2=Sides|first2=John|title=How Political Science can help Journalism (and still let journalists be journalists)|journal=The Forum|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news on the status of the elections, like other political reporting's, are provided in different mediums. The election report coverage has taken full advantage of the digital era in providing instant access to news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piechota|first1=Grazyna|title=Media in Election Process|journal=Communication Today|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Defense journalism''' or '''military journalism''' is a subgenre which focuses upon the current status of a nation's military, intelligence and other defense-related faculties. Interest in defense journalism tends to increase during times of violent conflict, with military leaders being the primary actors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} During the course of military journalism, news reporters are sometimes assigned to military units to report news taking place in areas of conflict. The term embedded journalism was used when the media was involved in the reporting of the war in Iraq. Embedded journalism can also be biased because it is one sided. Information reported has been collected from the area the journalist has been stationed with the possibility to lean towards the agenda of the group they have been assigned to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahey|first1=Shahira|last2=Johnson|first2=Thomas J.|title="HOW WE PERFORMED": EMBEDDED JOURNALISTS ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS TOWARDS COVERING THE IRAQ WAR"|journal=Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly|date=2005|pages=301–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subgenre of political journalism is also applied to media coming from journalists embedded in a particular campaign or candidate. Like military assignments, reports can be influenced by the message the campaign or candidate is trying to bring across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ignatius|first1=David|title=The dangers of embedded journalism, in war and politics|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/30/AR2010043001100_2.html?sid=ST2010043001134|website=Washington Post|date=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="6887" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|A rule that that the rounded number of seats to allocate to a party should be in between upper or lower roundings of its fractional value}}
In [[mathematic]]s and [[political science]], the '''quota rule''' governs the way a state should [[Apportionment (politics)|apportion]] representative seats. It states that the number of seats that should be allocated to a given party should be between the upper or lower roundings (called upper and lower quotas) of the [[proportional representation]];&lt;ref name="maa"&gt;Michael J. Caulfield. [https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/apportioning-representatives-in-the-united-states-congress-the-quota-rule "Apportioning Representatives in the United States Congress - The Quota Rule"]. MAA Publications. Retrieved October 22, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., if a party deserves 10.56 seats out of 15, the quota rule states that when the seats are allotted, the party may get 10 or 11 seats, but not lower or higher. The use of this rule is important when allocating seats for elected chambers such as the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], which use proportional representation.

==Mathematics==
If &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the population of the party, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the total population, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the number of available seats, then the natural quota for that party (the number of seats the party would ideally get) is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac P T \cdot S&lt;/math&gt;

The lower quota is then the natural quota rounded down to the nearest [[integer]] while the upper quota is the natural quota rounded up. The quota rule states that the only two allocations that a party can receive should be either the lower or upper quota.&lt;ref name="maa"/&gt; If at any time an allocation gives a party a greater or lesser number of seats than the upper or lower quota, that allocation (and by extension, the method used to allocate it) is said to be in violation of the quota rule. Another way to state this is to say that a given method only satisfies the quota rule if each party's allocation differs from its natural quota by less than one, where each party's allocation is an integer value.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Stein. [http://www.math.uconn.edu/~stein/math103/Slides/math103-02.pdf Apportionment Methods] Retrieved December 9, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
If there are 5 available seats in the council of a club with 300 members, and party ''A'' has 106 members, then the natural quota for party ''A'' is &lt;math&gt; \frac {106} {300} \cdot 5 \approx 1.8&lt;/math&gt;. The lower quota for party ''A'' is 1, because 1.8 rounded down equal 1. The upper quota, 1.8 rounded up, is 2. Therefore, the quota rule states that the only two allocations allowed for party ''A'' are 1 or 2 seats on the council. If there is a second party, ''B'', that has 137 members, then the quota rule states that party ''B'' gets &lt;math&gt; \frac {137} {300} \cdot 5 \approx 2.3&lt;/math&gt;, rounded up and down equals either 2 or 3 seats. Finally, a party ''C'' with the remaining 57 members of the club has a natural quota of &lt;math&gt; \frac {57} {300} \cdot 5 \approx 0.95&lt;/math&gt;, which means its allocated seats should be either 0 or 1. In all cases, the method for actually allocating the seats determines whether an allocation violates the quota rule, which in this case would mean giving party ''A'' any seats other than 1 or 2, giving party ''B'' any other than 2 or 3, or giving party ''C'' any other than 0 or 1 seat.

===Relation to other apportionment paradoxes===
The [[Apportionment_paradox#Balinski–Young_theorem|Balinski–Young theorem]] proved in 1980 that if an apportionment method satisfies the quota rule, it must fail to satisfy some other [[apportionment paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Beth-Allyn Osikiewicz, Ph.D. [http://www.personal.kent.edu/~bosikiew/Math11008/imposs-apportion.pdf  Impossibilities of Apportionment] Retrieved October 23, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, although [[Largest remainder method|Hamilton's method]] satisfies the quota rule, it violates the [[Alabama paradox]] and the [[population paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren D. Smith. (2007).[https://rangevoting.org/Apportion.html Apportionment and rounding schemes] Retrieved October 23, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem itself is broken up into several different proofs that cover a wide number of circumstances.&lt;ref name="Balinski"&gt;M.L. Balinski and H.P. Young. (1980). [http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/1338/1/WP-80-131.pdf "The Theory of Apportionment"]. Retrieved October 23 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, there are two main statements that apply to the quota rule:
*Any method that follows the quota rule must fail the population paradox.&lt;ref name="Balinski"/&gt;
*Any method that is free of both the Alabama paradox and the population paradox must necessarily fail the quota rule for some circumstances.&lt;ref name="Balinski"/&gt;

==Use in apportionment methods==
Different methods for allocating seats may or may not satisfy the quota rule. While many methods do violate the quota rule, it is sometimes preferable to violate the rule very rarely than to violate some other apportionment paradox; some sophisticated methods violate the rule so rarely that it has not ever happened in a real apportionment, while some methods that never violate the quota rule violate other paradoxes in much more serious fashions.

[[Hamilton's method]] does satisfy the quota rule. The method works by proportioning seats equally until a fractional value is reached; the surplus seats are then given to the state with the largest fractional parts until there are no more surplus seats. Because it is impossible to give more than one surplus seat to a state, every state will always get either its lower or upper quota.&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Freeman. [http://www.math.colostate.edu/~freeman/m130/apportionment1.pdf "Apportionment"]. Retrieved October 22 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jefferson's method]], which was one of the first used by the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.cas.uab.edu/~jcmayer/Apportionment%202.pdf "Apportionment 2"] Retrieved October 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes violated the quota rule by allocating more seats than the upper quota allowed.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.math.colostate.edu/~spriggs/m130/apportionment2.pdf Jefferson’s Method] Retrieved October 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This violation led to a growing problem where larger states receive more representatives than smaller states, which was not corrected until [[Webster/Sainte-Laguë method|Webster's method]] was implemented in 1842; even though Webster's method does violate the quota rule, it happens extremely rarely.&lt;ref&gt;Ghidewon Abay Asmerom.

Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights.&lt;ref name="Freeman15"/&gt; The true forerunner of human-rights discourse was the concept of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]] which appeared as part of the medieval [[natural law]] tradition that became prominent during the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. From this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
 
17th-century English philosopher [[John Locke]] discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being "life, liberty, and estate (property)", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the [[social contract]]. In Britain in 1689, the English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and the Scottish [[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]] each made illegal a range of oppressive governmental actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Britain's unwritten constitution |url= http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution |publisher=British Library |accessdate=27 November 2015 |quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown ... providing for the regular meeting of Parliament, free elections to the Commons, free speech in parliamentary debates, and some basic human rights, most famously freedom from 'cruel or unusual punishment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the United States (1776) and in France (1789), leading to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] respectively, both of which articulated certain human rights. Additionally, the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] of 1776 encoded into law a number of fundamental [[civil rights]] and civil freedoms.

===1800 to World War I===

[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|left|thumb|[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] approved by the National Assembly of France, 26 August 1789]]
Philosophers such as [[Thomas Paine]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Hegel]] expanded on the theme of [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1831 [[William Lloyd Garrison]] wrote in a newspaper called ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'' that he was trying to enlist his readers in "the great cause of human rights"&lt;ref&gt;Mayer (2000) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; so the term ''human rights'' probably came into use sometime between Paine's ''The Rights of Man'' and Garrison's publication. In 1849 a contemporary, [[Henry David Thoreau]], wrote about human rights in his treatise ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|On the Duty of Civil Disobedience]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20070125084109/http://www.cs.indiana.edu/statecraft/civ.dis.html ] which was later influential on human rights and civil rights thinkers. United States [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|Supreme Court Justice David Davis]], in his 1867 opinion for [[Ex Parte Milligan]], wrote "By the protection of the law, human rights are secured; withdraw that protection and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers or the clamor of an excited people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Ex Parte Milligan'', 71 U.S. 2, 119. (full text) |url=http://www.law.uchicago.edu/tribunals/docs/milligan.pdf |date=December 1866 |accessdate=28 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307053820/http://www.law.uchicago.edu/tribunals/docs/milligan.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many groups and movements have managed to achieve profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights. In Western Europe and North America, [[trade union|labour union]]s brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating [[child labor|child labour]]. The [[women's rights]] movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to [[vote]]. [[National liberation]] movements in many countries succeeded in driving out colonial powers. One of the most influential was [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s movement to free his native [[India]] from British rule. Movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the [[civil rights movement]], and more recent diverse [[identity politics]] movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the United States.

The foundation of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], the 1864 [[Lieber Code]] and the first of the [[Geneva Conventions]] in 1864 laid the foundations of [[International humanitarian law]], to be further developed following the two World Wars.

===Between World War I and World War II===

The [[League of Nations]] was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the [[Treaty of Versailles]] following the end of [[World War I]]. The League's goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation, diplomacy and improving global welfare. Enshrined in its Charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights which were later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The League of Nations had mandates to support many of the former colonies of the Western European colonial powers during their transition from colony to independent state.

Established as an agency of the League of Nations, and now part of United Nations, the [[International Labour Organization]] also had a mandate to promote and safeguard certain of the rights later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR):

On the issue of "universal", the declarations did not apply to domestic discrimination or racism.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gordon Lauren, “First Principles of Racial Equality: History and the Politics and Diplomacy of Human Rights Provisions in the United Nations Charter,” ''Human Rights Quarterly'' 5 (1983): 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry J. Richardson III has argued:
:All major governments at the time of drafting the U.N. charter and the Universal declaration did their best to ensure, by all means known to domestic and international law, that these principles had only international application and carried no legal obligation on those governments to be implemented domestically. All tacitly realized that for their own discriminated-against minorities to acquire leverage on the basis of legally being able to claim enforcement of these wide-reaching rights would create pressures that would be political dynamite.&lt;ref&gt;Henry J. Richardson III, “Black People, Technocracy, and Legal Process: Thoughts, Fears, and Goals,” in ''Public Policy for the Black Community,'' ed. by Marguerite Ross Barnett and James A. Hefner (Port Washington, N.Y.: Alfred Publishing, 1976), p, 179.&lt;/ref&gt;
====Universal Declaration of Human Rights====

{{main|Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}

[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt UDHR.jpg|right|thumb|200px|"It is not a [[treaty]]...[In the future, it] may well become the international [[Magna Carta]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/eleanorrooseveltdeclarationhumanrights.htm Eleanor Roosevelt: Address to the United Nations General Assembly] 10 December 1948 in Paris, France&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] with the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1949]]
 
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) is a non-binding declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly&lt;ref&gt;(A/RES/217, 10 December 1948 at Palais de Chaillot, Paris)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1948, partly in response to the barbarism of [[World War II]]. The UDHR urges member states to promote a number of human, civil, economic and social rights, asserting these rights are part of the "foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world". The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behavior of states and press upon them duties to their citizens following the model of the [[corelative|rights-duty duality]].

{{quote|...recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and [[inalienable rights]] of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world|Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948}}

The UDHR was framed by members of the Human Rights Commission, with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] as Chair, who began to discuss an ''International Bill of Rights'' in 1947. The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced. The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties, but the UDHR quickly became the priority.&lt;ref name=Glendon&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Rule of Law in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights |last=Glendon |first=Mary Ann |url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/jihr/v2/5/ |journal=Northwestern University Journal of International Human Rights |date=July 2004 |volume=2 |number=5 |access-date=7 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720014500/http://www.law.northwestern.edu/journals/jihr/v2/5/ |archive-date=20 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian law professor John Humprey and French lawyer [[Rene Cassin]] were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble. The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights. The final three articles place, according to Cassin, rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realized.&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt; Humphrey and Cassin intended the rights in the UDHR to be legally enforceable through some means, as is reflected in the third clause of the preamble:&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;

{{quote|Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.|Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948}}

Some of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights, including representatives from all continents and all major religions, and drawing on consultation with leaders such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;Glendon (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights&lt;ref name=Glendon/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ball, Gready 2007 p.34"&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.34&lt;/ref&gt; was predicated on the assumption that basic human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked. Though this principle was not opposed by any member states at the time of adoption (the declaration was adopted unanimously, with the abstention of the [[Soviet bloc]], [[Apartheid]] South Africa and [[Saudi Arabia]]), this principle was later subject to significant challenges.&lt;ref name="Ball, Gready 2007 p.34"/&gt;

The onset of the [[Cold War]] soon after the UDHR was conceived brought to the fore divisions over the inclusion of both economic and social rights and civil and political rights in the declaration. Capitalist states tended to place strong emphasis on civil and political rights (such as freedom of association and expression), and were reluctant to include economic and social rights (such as the right to work and the right to join a union). Socialist states placed much greater importance on economic and social rights and argued strongly for their inclusion.&lt;ref name="Ball, Gready 2007 p.35"&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the divisions over which rights to include, and because some states declined to ratify any treaties including certain specific interpretations of human rights, and despite the Soviet bloc and a number of developing countries arguing strongly for the inclusion of all rights in a so-called ''Unity Resolution'', the rights enshrined in the UDHR were split into two separate covenants, allowing states to adopt some rights and derogate others. Though this allowed the covenants to be created, it denied the proposed principle that all rights are linked which was central to some interpretations of the UDHR.&lt;ref name="Ball, Gready 2007 p.35"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Human Rights and Human Wrongs |author=Littman, David G. |date=19 January 2003 |quote=The principal aim of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was to create a framework for a universal code based on mutual consent. The early years of the United Nations were overshadowed by the division between the Western and Communist conceptions of human rights, although neither side called into question the concept of universality. The debate centered on which "rights" – political, economic, and social – were to be included among the Universal Instruments|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-littman011903.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the UDHR is a non-binding resolution, it is now considered to be a central component of international [[customary law]] which may be invoked under appropriate circumstances by state judiciaries and other judiciaries.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human Rights Treaties====

In 1966, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ('''ICCPR''') and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ('''ICESCR''') were adopted by the United Nations, between them making the rights contained in the UDHR binding on all states.&lt;ref&gt;This does not include the Vatican, which although recognised as an independent state, is not a member of the UN.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they came into force only in 1976, when they were ratified by a sufficient number of countries (despite achieving the ICCPR, a covenant including no economic or social rights, the US only ratified the ICCPR in 1992).&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.37&lt;/ref&gt; The ICESCR commits 155 state parties to work toward the granting of economic, social, and cultural rights (ESCR) to individuals. 
{{clr}}

Since then numerous other treaties ([[International human rights instruments|pieces of legislation]]) have been offered at the international level. They are generally known as ''human rights instruments''. Some of the most significant are:

*[[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] (adopted 1948, entry into force: 1951) [http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/p_genoci.htm ]
*[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] ('''CERD''') (adopted 1966, entry into force: 1969) [http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/d_icerd.htm ]
*[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] ('''CEDAW''') (entry into force: 1981) [http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/index.html ]
*[[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] ('''CAT''') (adopted 1984, entry into force: 1984) [http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_cat39.htm ]
*[[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] ('''CRC''') (adopted 1989, entry into force: 1989) [http://www.unicef.org/crc Convention on the Rights of the Child]

*[[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] ('''ICC''') (entry into force: 2002)

==International bodies==

===The United Nations===

{{main|United Nations}}

[[File:Unpicture.jpg|thumb|right|The UN General Assembly]]
The '''United Nations (UN)''' is the only multilateral governmental agency with universally accepted international [[jurisdiction]] for universal human rights legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.92&lt;/ref&gt; All UN organs have advisory roles to the [[United Nations Security Council]] and the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], and there are numerous committees within the UN with responsibilities for safeguarding different human rights treaties. The most senior body of the UN with regard to human rights is the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The United Nations has an international mandate to:

{{quote|...achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.|||Article 1–3 of the [[United Nations Charter]]}}

== Protection in the international level ==
===Human Rights Council===
{{main|United Nations Human Rights Council}}
The UN Human Rights Council, created in 2005, has a mandate to investigate alleged human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=United Nations News Page |url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/infocusRel.asp?infocusID=114&amp;Body=human%20rights%20council&amp;Body1= |title=United Nations Rights Council Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; 47 of the 193 UN member states sit on the Council, elected by simple majority in a secret ballot of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. Members serve a maximum of six years and may have their membership suspended for gross human rights abuses. The Council is based in [[Geneva]], and meets three times a year; with additional meetings to respond to urgent situations.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent experts (''rapporteurs'') are retained by the Council to investigate alleged human rights abuses and to report to the Council.

The [[Human Rights Council]] may request that the Security Council refer cases to the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) even if the issue being referred is outside the normal jurisdiction of the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;The Security Council referred the human rights situation in [[Darfur]] in Sudan to the ICC despite the fact that Sudan has a functioning legal system&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN treaty bodies===
{{anchor|Treaty bodies}}&lt;!-- [[Human rights treaty bodies]] redirects here --&gt;
In addition to the political bodies whose mandate flows from the UN charter, the UN has set up a number of ''treaty-based'' bodies, comprising committees of independent experts who monitor compliance with human rights standards and norms flowing from the core international human rights treaties. They are supported by and are created by the treaty that they monitor, With the exception of the CESCR, which was established under a resolution of the Economic and Social Council to carry out the monitoring functions originally assigned to that body under the Covenant, they are technically autonomous bodies, established by the treaties that they monitor and accountable to the state parties of those treaties – rather than subsidiary to the United Nations, though in practice they are closely intertwined with the United Nations system and are supported by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (UNHCHR) and the UN Centre for Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Human Rights Committee]]'' promotes participation with the standards of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]]. The members of the committee express opinions on member countries and make judgments on individual complaints against countries which have ratified an Optional Protocol to the treaty. The judgments, termed "views", are not legally binding. The member of the committee meets around three times a year to hold sessions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CCPR/Pages/CCPRIntro.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} Introduction of the Committee|website=www.ohchr.org|access-date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]'' monitors the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]] and makes general comments on ratifying countries performance. It will have the power to receive complaints against the countries that opted into the Optional Protocol once it has come into force. It is important to note that unlike the other treaty bodies, the economic committee is not an autonomous body responsible to the treaty parties, but directly responsible to the Economic and Social Council and ultimately to the General Assembly. This means that the Economic Committee faces particular difficulties at its disposal only relatively "weak" means of implementation in comparison to other treaty bodies.&lt;ref name=Shaw309&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Shaw |2008 |p=309 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular difficulties noted by commentators include: perceived vagueness of the principles of the treaty, relative lack of legal texts and decisions, ambivalence of many states in addressing economic, social and cultural rights, comparatively few non-governmental organisations focused on the area and problems with obtaining relevant and precise information.&lt;ref name=Shaw309/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* The ''Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination'' monitors the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|CERD]] and conducts regular reviews of countries' performance. It can make judgments on complaints against member states allowing it, but these are not legally binding. It issues warnings to attempt to prevent serious contraventions of the convention.
* The ''Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women'' monitors the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]]. It receives states' reports on their performance and comments on them, and can make judgments on complaints against countries which have opted into the 1999 Optional Protocol.
* The ''Committee Against Torture'' monitors the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|CAT]] and receives states' reports on their performance every four years and comments on them. Its subcommittee may visit and inspect countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol.
* The ''[[Committee on the Rights of the Child]]'' monitors the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]] and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years. It does not have the power to receive complaints.
* The ''Committee on Migrant Workers'' was established in 2004 and monitors the [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families|ICRMW]] and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years. It will have the power to receive complaints of specific violations only once ten member states allow it.
* The ''[[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]'' was established in 2008 to monitor the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. It has the power to receive complaints against the countries which have opted into the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]].
* The ''Committee on Enforced Disappearances'' monitors the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance|ICPPED]]. All States parties are obliged to submit reports to the Committee on how the rights are being implemented. The Committee examines each report and addresses its concerns and recommendations to the State party in the form of "concluding observations".

Each treaty body receives secretariat support from the Human Rights Council and Treaties Division of Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) in Geneva except CEDAW, which is supported by the Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW). CEDAW formerly held all its sessions at United Nations headquarters in New York but now frequently meets at the United Nations Office in Geneva; the other treaty bodies meet in Geneva. The Human Rights Committee usually holds its March session in New York City.

The [[African Union]] (AU) is a supranational union consisting of fifty-five African states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/memberstates/map.htm|title=AU Member States|publisher=African Union|accessdate=3 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105082457/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/memberstates/map.htm|archive-date=5 January 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2001, the AU's purpose is to help secure Africa's democracy, human rights, and a sustainable economy, especially by bringing an end to intra-African conflict and creating an effective common market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/AboutAu/au_in_a_nutshell_en.htm|title=AU in a Nutshell|accessdate=3 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230204052/http://www.africa-union.org/root/AU/AboutAu/au_in_a_nutshell_en.htm|archive-date=30 December 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (ACHPR) is a quasi-judicial organ of the African Union tasked with promoting and protecting human rights and collective (peoples') rights throughout the African continent as well as interpreting the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and considering individual complaints of violations of the Charter. The Commission has three broad areas of responsibility:&lt;ref name=mandate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/mandate_en.html|title=Mandate of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120104536/http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/mandate_en.html|archive-date=20 January 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Promoting human and peoples' rights 
* Protecting human and peoples' rights 
* Interpreting the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]]

In pursuit of these goals, the Commission is mandated to "collect documents, undertake studies and researches on African problems in the field of human and peoples, rights, organise seminars, symposia and conferences, disseminate information, encourage national and local institutions concerned with human and peoples' rights and, should the case arise, give its views or make recommendations to governments" (Charter, Art. 45).&lt;ref name=mandate/&gt;

With the creation of the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (under a protocol to the Charter which was adopted in 1998 and entered into force in January 2004), the Commission will have the additional task of preparing cases for submission to the Court's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=court&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/court_en.html|title=PROTOCOL TO THE AFRICAN CHARTER ON HUMAN AND PEOPLES' RIGHTS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN AFRICAN COURT ON HUMAN AND PEOPLES' RIGHTS|accessdate=3 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302212249/http://www.achpr.org/english/_info/court_en.html|archive-date=2 March 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2004 decision, the AU Assembly resolved that the future Court on Human and Peoples' Rights would be integrated with the African Court of Justice.

===Americas===
The [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) is an international organization, headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. Its members are the thirty-five independent states of the Americas. Over the course of the 1990s, with the end of the [[Cold War]], the return to democracy in Latin America, and the thrust toward [[globalization]], the OAS made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context. Its stated priorities now include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/key_issues/eng/default.asp|title=OAS Key Issues|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Strengthening democracy
* Working for peace

* Combating corruption
* The rights of Indigenous Peoples
* Promoting sustainable development

The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (the IACHR) is an autonomous organ of the Organization of American States, also based in Washington, D.C. Along with the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], based in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], Costa Rica, it is one of the bodies that comprise the inter-American system for the promotion and protection of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/documents/eng/biographies.asp?group=hhrr|publisher=Organization of American States|title=Directory of OAS Authorities|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IACHR is a permanent body which meets in regular and special sessions several times a year to examine allegations of human rights violations in the hemisphere. Its human rights duties stem from three documents:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cidh.oas.org/what.htm|title=What is the IACHR?|publisher=Inter-Americal Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] 
* the [[American Convention on Human Rights]]

The Inter-Americal Court of Human Rights was established in 1979 with the purpose of enforcing and interpreting the provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights. Its two main functions are thus adjudicatory and advisory. Under the former, it hears and rules on the specific cases of human rights violations referred to it. Under the latter, it issues opinions on matters of legal interpretation brought to its attention by other OAS bodies or member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corteidh.or.cr/index.cfm?CFID=25331&amp;CFTOKEN=36922058|title=InterAmerican Court on Human Rights homepage|publisher=Inter-American Court on Human Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe]], founded in 1949, is the oldest organisation working for European integration. It is an international organisation with legal personality recognised under public international law and has observer status with the United Nations. The seat of the Council of Europe is in [[Strasbourg]] in France. The Council of Europe is responsible for both the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Council&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/Human_rights/|title=Council of Europe Human Rights|publisher=Council of Europe|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These institutions bind the Council's members to a code of human rights which, though strict, are more lenient than those of the United Nations charter on human rights.

==Philosophies of human rights==
{{rights}}

Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why human rights become part of social expectations.

One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds.

Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with [[David Hume|Hume]]). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of [[Max Weber|Weber]]). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) – a social contract.

===Natural rights===

{{main|Natural law|Natural rights}}

Natural law theories base human rights on a "natural" moral, religious or even biological order which is independent of transitory human laws or traditions.

[[Socrates]] and his philosophic heirs, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], posited the existence of [[natural justice]] or natural right (''dikaion physikon'', ''δικαιον φυσικον'', [[Latin]] ''ius naturale'').  Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law,&lt;ref&gt;Shellens (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; although evidence for this is due largely to the interpretations of his work of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaffa (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of this tradition of [[natural justice]] into one of natural law is usually attributed to the [[Stoicism|Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sills (1968, 1972) ''Natural Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the early [[Church fathers]] sought to incorporate the until then [[pagan]] concept of natural law into Christianity. Natural law theories have featured greatly in the philosophies of [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Francisco Suárez]], [[Richard Hooker]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], and [[John Locke]].

In the Seventeenth Century [[Thomas Hobbes]] founded a [[social contract|contractualist theory]] of [[legal positivism]] on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) was subject to contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death at the hands of another). The natural law was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act. It was discovered by considering humankind's [[natural rights]], whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law.  In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign. In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor.

[[Hugo Grotius]] based his philosophy of international law on natural law. He wrote that "even the will of an [[omnipotent]] being cannot change or abrogate" natural law, which "would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no God or that he does not care for human affairs." (''De iure belli ac pacis'', Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous argument ''etiamsi daremus'' (''non-esse Deum''), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology.

[[John Locke]] incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect "life, liberty, and property," people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.

The Belgian philosopher of law [[Frank van Dun]] is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm|author=van Dun, Frank|accessdate=28 December 2007|title=Natural Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; of natural law in the liberal tradition. There are also emerging and secular forms of natural law theory that define human rights as derivative of the notion of universal human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohen (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "human rights" has replaced the term "[[natural rights]]" in popularity, because the rights are less and less frequently seen as requiring [[natural law]] for their existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Weston, Burns H.|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106289?query=human%20rights&amp;ct=eb|title=Human Rights|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Online, p. 2|accessdate=18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories of human rights===

The philosopher [[John Finnis]] argues that human rights are justifiable on the grounds of their instrumental value in creating the necessary conditions for human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hum-rts.htm#SH4b|title=''Human Rights''|encyclopedia=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=Fagan, Andrew|year=2006|accessdate=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finnis (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; Interest theories highlight the duty to respect the rights of other individuals on grounds of self-interest:

{{quote|Human rights law, applied to a State's own citizens serves the interest of states, by, for example, minimizing the risk of violent resistance and protest and by keeping the level of dissatisfaction with the government manageable|||Niraj Nathwani in ''Rethinking refugee law''&lt;ref&gt;Nathwani (2003) p.25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Biology|biological]] theory considers the comparative reproductive advantage of human social behavior based on empathy and [[altruism]] in the context of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnhart (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Schloss (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul, Miller, Paul (2001): Arnhart, Larry. ''Thomistic Natural Law as Darwinian Natural Right'' p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts in human rights==

===Indivisibility and categorization of rights===

The most common categorization of human rights is to split them into civil and political rights, and economic, social and cultural rights.

Civil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the ICCPR. Economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the ICESCR. The UDHR included both economic, social and cultural rights and civil and political rights because it was based on the principle that the different rights could only successfully exist in combination:

{{quote|The ideal of free human beings enjoying civil and political freedom and freedom from fear and want can only be achieved if conditions are created whereby everyone may enjoy his civil and political rights, as well as his social, economic and cultural rights|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, 1966}}

This is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights. Similarly, without livelihoods and a working society, the public cannot assert or make use of civil or political rights (known as the ''full belly thesis'')

Although accepted by the signaturies to the UDHR, most of them do not in practice give equal weight to the different types of rights. Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the right to work, to education, health and housing. For example, in the United States there is no universal access to [[Health care|healthcare]] free at the point of use.&lt;ref&gt;Light (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; That is not to say that Western cultures have overlooked these rights entirely (the welfare states that exist in Western Europe are evidence of this). Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights.

Another categorization, offered by [[Karel Vasak]], is that there are ''[[three generations of human rights]]'': first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment). Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition. This categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others. Prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity. Human rights expert [[Philip Alston]] argues:

{{quote|If every possible human rights element is deemed to be essential or necessary, then nothing will be treated as though it is truly important.|Philip Alston&lt;ref name="Alston 2005"&gt;Alston (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He, and others, urge caution with prioritisation of rights:

{{quote|...the call for prioritizing is not to suggest that any obvious violations of rights can be ignored.|Philip Alston&lt;ref name="Alston 2005"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Priorities, where necessary, should adhere to core concepts (such as reasonable attempts at progressive realization) and principles (such as non-discrimination, equality and participation.|Olivia Ball, Paul Gready&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready. (2007) p.42&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some human rights are said to be "[[inalienable rights]]."  The term inalienable rights (or unalienable rights) refers to "a set of human rights that are fundamental, are not awarded by human power, and cannot be surrendered."

The adherence to the principle of indivisibility by the international community was reaffirmed in 1995:

{{quote|All human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and related. The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis.|Vienna Declaration and Program of Action, World Conference on Human Rights, 1995}}

This statement was again endorsed at the 2005 World Summit in New York (paragraph 121).

===Universalism vs cultural relativism===

{{main|Cultural relativism|Moral relativism|Moral universalism|Universal ethic}}

[[File:Fgm map.gif|right|thumb|Map: Estimated Prevalence of Female Genital Cutting (FGC) in Africa. Data based on uncertain estimates.]]

The UDHR enshrines, by definition, rights that apply to all humans equally, whichever geographical location, state, race or culture they belong to.

Proponents of cultural relativism suggest that human rights are not all universal, and indeed conflict with some cultures and threaten their survival.

Rights which are most often contested with relativistic arguments are the rights of women. For example, [[Female genital mutilation]] occurs in different cultures in Africa, Asia and South America. It is not mandated by any religion, but has become a tradition in many cultures. It is considered a violation of women's and girl's rights by much of the international community, and is outlawed in some countries.

Universalism has been described by some as cultural, economic or political imperialism. In particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically liberal outlook which, although generally accepted in Europe, Japan or North America, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere.

For example, in 1981, the Iranian representative to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by saying that the UDHR was "a [[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.&lt;ref name="Littman1999"&gt;Littman (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The former Prime Ministers of Singapore, [[Lee Kuan Yew]], and of [[Malaysia]], [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] both claimed in the 1990s that ''Asian values'' were significantly different from western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity, and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy. This view is countered by Mahathir's former deputy:

{{quote|To say that freedom is Western or unAsian is to offend our traditions as well as our forefathers, who gave their lives in the struggle against tyranny and injustices.|[[Anwar Ibrahim]] in his keynote speech to the Asian Press Forum title ''Media and Society in Asia'', 2 December 1994}}

and also by Singapore's opposition leader [[Chee Soon Juan]] who states that it is racist to assert that Asians do not want human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Rights: Dirty Words in Singapore|publisher=Activating Human Rights and Diversity Conference (Byron Bay, Australia)|date=3 July 2003|author=Chee, S.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An appeal is often made to the fact that influential human rights thinkers, such as [[John Locke]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], have all been Western and indeed that some were involved in the running of Empires themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Tunick (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beate (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Relativistic arguments tend to neglect the fact that modern human rights are new to all cultures, dating back no further than the UDHR in 1948. They also don't account for the fact that the UDHR was drafted by people from many different cultures and traditions, including a US Roman Catholic, a Chinese Confucian philosopher, a French Zionist and a representative from the Arab League, amongst others, and drew upon advice from thinkers such as Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Ball, Gready 2007 p.34"/&gt;

[[Michael Ignatieff]] has argued that cultural relativism is almost exclusively an argument used by those who wield power in cultures which commit human rights abuses, and that those whose human rights are compromised are the powerless.&lt;ref&gt;Ignatief, M. (2001) p.68&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture.

Although the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete, it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable. The [[2005 World Summit]] reaffirmed the international community's adherence to this principle:

{{quote|The universal nature of human rights and freedoms is beyond question.|2005 World Summit, paragraph 120}}

===State and non-state actors===

Companies, NGOs, political parties, informal groups, and individuals are known as ''non-State actors''. Non-State actors can also commit human rights abuses, but are not subject to human rights law other than International Humanitarian Law, which applies to individuals.

[[Multinational corporation|Multi-national companies]] play an increasingly large role in the world, and are responsible for a large number of human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/worldreport99/special/corporations.html|title=Corporations and Human Rights|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed, that surrounding multi-national companies is both controversial and ill-defined. Multi-national companies' primary responsibility is to their [[shareholders]], not to those affected by their actions. Such companies are often larger than the economies of the states in which they operate, and can wield significant economic and political power. No international treaties exist to specifically cover the behavior of companies with regard to human rights, and national legislation is very variable. [[Jean Ziegler]], Special Rapporteur of the UN [[Commission on Human Rights]] on the right to food stated in a report in 2003:

{{quote|the growing power of transnational corporations and their extension of power through privatization, deregulation and the rolling back of the State also mean that it is now time to develop binding legal norms that hold corporations to human rights standards and circumscribe potential abuses of their position of power.|Jean Ziegler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=8536&amp;Cr=right&amp;Cr1=food|title=Transnational corporations should be held to human rights standards – UN expert|accessdate=2008-01-03|date=13 October 2003|publisher=UN News Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In August 2003 the Human Rights Commission's Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights produced draft ''Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(Symbol)/E.CN.4.Sub.2.2003.12.Rev.2.En.|title=Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights|publisher=UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were considered by the Human Rights Commission in 2004, but have no binding status on corporations and are not monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REPORT TO THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL ON THE SIXTIETH SESSION OF THE COMMISSION (E/CN.4/2004/L.11/Add.7)|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/e06a5300f90fa0238025668700518ca4/169143c3c1009015c1256e830058c441/$FILE/G0413976.pdf|page=81|publisher=United Nations Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=3 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal instruments and jurisdiction===
[[File:International Criminal Court logo.svg|thumb|The official logo of the ICC]]

The human rights enshrined in the UDHR, the Geneva Conventions and the various enforced treaties of the United Nations are enforceable in law. In practice, many rights are very difficult to legally enforce due to the absence of consensus on the application of certain rights, the lack of relevant national legislation or of bodies empowered to take legal action to enforce them.

There exist a number of internationally recognized organisations with worldwide mandate or [[jurisdiction]] over certain aspects of human rights:

*The [[International Court of Justice]] is the United Nations' primary judiciary body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icj-cij.org/|title=Cour internationale de Justice - International Court of Justice &amp;#124; International Court of Justice|website=www.icj-cij.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has worldwide [[Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice|jurisdiction]]. It is directed by the [[International Court of Justice#The ICJ and the Security Council|Security Council]]. The ICJ settles disputes between nations. The ICJ does not have jurisdiction over individuals.
*The [[International Criminal Court]] is the body responsible for investigating and punishing [[war crimes]], and [[Crimes against humanity]] when such occur within its jurisdiction, with a mandate to bring to justice perpetrators of such crimes that occurred after its creation in 2002. A number of UN members have not joined the court and the ICC does not have jurisdiction over their citizens, and others have signed but not yet ratified the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]], which established the court.&lt;ref name=untreaty&gt;United Nations.  ''Multilateral treaties deposited with the Secretary-General: [http://untreaty.un.org/ENGLISH/bible/englishinternetbible/partI/chapterXVIII/treaty11.asp Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court'']. Retrieved 8 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICC and other international courts (see [[Human rights#Regional human rights|Regional human rights above]] exist to take action where the national legal system of a state is unable to try the case itself. If national law is able to safeguard human rights and punish those who breach human rights legislation, it has primary jurisdiction by complementarity. Only when all ''local remedies'' have been exhausted does international law take effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Resource Part II: The International Human Rights System|url=http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/comp201.htm#1.1|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In over 110 countries [[National human rights institutions]] (NHRIs) have been set up to protect, promote or monitor human rights with jurisdiction in a given country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhri.net/|title=National Human Right Institutions Forum – An international forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of national human rights|publisher=|access-date=6 September 2007|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020915131117/http://www.nhri.net/|archive-date=15 September 2002|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not all NHRIs are compliant with the Paris Principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhri.net/2007/List_Accredited_NIs_Nov_2007.pdf|title=Chart of the Status of National Institutions|publisher=National Human Rights Institutions Forum|quote=ACCREDITED BY THE INTERNATIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE OF NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS&lt;br /&gt;In accordance with the Paris Principles and the ICC Sub-Committee Rules of Procedure, the following classifications for accreditation are used by the ICC:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A: Compliance with the Paris Principles;&lt;br /&gt;A(R): Accreditation with reserve – granted where insufficient documentation is submitted to confer A status;&lt;br /&gt;B: Observer Status – Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided to make a determination;&lt;br /&gt;C: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles.|date=November 2007|accessdate=6 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216052314/http://www.nhri.net/2007/List_Accredited_NIs_Nov_2007.pdf|archive-date=16 February 2008|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number and effect of these institutions is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huridocs.org/|title=HURIDOCS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paris Principles]] were defined at the first International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Paris on 7–9 October 1991, and adopted by United Nations Human Rights Commission Resolution 1992/54 of 1992 and the General Assembly Resolution 48/134 of 1993. The Paris Principles list a number of responsibilities for national institutions.&lt;ref&gt;"National Human Rights Institutions – Implementing Human Rights", Executive Director Morten Kjærum, The Danish Institute for Human Rights, 2003. {{ISBN|87-90744-72-1}}, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Universal jurisdiction]] is a controversial principle in international law whereby states claim criminal jurisdiction over persons whose alleged crimes were committed outside the boundaries of the prosecuting state, regardless of nationality, country of residence, or any other relation with the prosecuting country. The state backs its claim on the grounds that the crime committed is considered a crime against all, which any state is authorized to punish. The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that certain international norms are [[erga omnes]], or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of [[jus cogens]]. In 1993 [[Belgium]] passed a ''law of universal jurisdiction'' to give its courts jurisdiction over crimes against humanity in other countries, and in 1998 [[Augusto Pinochet]] was arrested in London following an indictment by Spanish judge [[Baltasar Garzon]] under the universal jurisdiction principle.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Gready (2007) p.70&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is supported by [[Amnesty International]] and other [[List of human rights organisations|human rights organisations]] as they believe certain crimes pose a threat to the international community as a whole and the community has a moral duty to act, but others, including [[Henry Kissinger]] (who has himself been accused of war crimes by several commentators&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/intljustice/wanted/kissingerindex.htm|title=Henry Kissenger|accessdate=6 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views02/0611-03.htm|title=Gee, Marcus|date=11 June 2002|publisher=Toronto Globe &amp; Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;), argue that [[state sovereignty]] is paramount, because breaches of rights committed in other countries are outside states' sovereign interest and because states could use the principle for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pitfall of Universal Jurisdiction|journal=Foreign Affairs|author=Kissinger, Henry|date=July–August 2001|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010701faessay4996/henry-a-kissinger/the-pitfalls-of-universal-jurisdiction.html|access-date=6 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114024521/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20010701faessay4996/henry-a-kissinger/the-pitfalls-of-universal-jurisdiction.html|archive-date=14 January 2009|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}'''Human rights violations''' occur when any state or non-state actor breaches any of the terms of the UDHR or other international human rights or humanitarian law. In regard to human rights violations of United Nations laws. Article 39 of the [[United Nations Charter]] designates the UN [[Security Council]] (or an appointed authority) as the only tribunal that may determine UN human rights violations.

Human rights abuses are monitored by United Nations committees, national institutions and governments and by many independent [[non-governmental organizations]], such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[World Organisation Against Torture]], [[Freedom House]], [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] and [[Anti-Slavery International]]. These organisations collect evidence and documentation of human rights abuses and apply pressure to promote human rights

Wars of aggression, [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]], including [[genocide]], are breaches of [[International humanitarian law]].

'''Presumption of guilt''' is the principle that one is considered guilty unless proven innocent: thus the burden of proof is on the accused, not the accuser.&lt;ref&gt;legal dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/presumption+of+guilt&lt;/ref&gt; Presumption of guilt is a denial of an international [[human right]] under Article 11 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="UDHR"&gt;https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/&lt;/ref&gt; Under the presumption of guilt, the [[legal burden of proof]] is thus on the [[Public defender|defense]], which must collect and present compelling evidence to the trier of fact. Presumption of guilt shifts the [[burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] onto the defendant, who must then prove their [[Innocent|innocence]] in order to achieve [[acquittal]].&lt;ref&gt;''A digest of the law of evidence in criminal cases'' W. Benning &amp; Company, 1846&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
In [[criminal law]], [[Blackstone's ratio]] is the idea that it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/blackstone-commentaries-on-the-laws-of-england-in-four-books-vol-2/simple|title=Commentaries on the laws of England|publisher=J.B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; as expressed by the English jurist [[William Blackstone]] in ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', published in the 1760s.  The idea subsequently became a staple of legal thinking in [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] jurisdictions and continues to be a topic of debate.

The phrase "presumption of guilt" has been in use since at least the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;T. C. Granger. ''A digest of the law of evidence in criminal cases'' W. Benning &amp; Company, 1846&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herbert L. Packer]], "It would be a  mistake to think of the presumption of guilt as the opposite of the [[presumption of innocence]] that we are so used to thinking of as the polestar of the criminal process and which... occupies an important position in the [[due process|Due Process Model]]."&lt;ref name="Two Models"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Packer| first = Herbert L.| author-link = Herbert L. Packer| title = TWO MODELS OF THE CRIMINAL PROCESS| journal = University of Pennsylvania Law Review| volume = 113| issue = 1| pages = 1–68| publisher = University of Pennsylvania| location = Pennsylvania| date = November 1964| language = English| url = https://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6428&amp;context=penn_law_review | doi = 10.2307/3310562| jstor = 3310562}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presumption of guilt prioritizes speed and efficiency over reliability, and prevails when [[due process]] is absent.&lt;ref name="Two Models" /&gt;

==Typology==

Presumption of guilt may take differing forms: 
 
* [[Collective guilt]], for example the belief that 'all Muslims are terrorists';&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer Case]], 'Islamist Terror and Collective Guilt', [[national Review]], 4 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, the terrorist may believe his victims to be collectively guilty of some perceived injustice, as in the case of [[9/11]]. A belief in [[Jewish deicide]] expresses the view that 'all Jews are Christ-killers',&lt;ref&gt;Peter J Tomson, ''Presumed Guilty: How the Jews were Blamed For the Death of Jesus'', Fortress Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Rushing to [[judgement]], for example equating arrest with conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luke Gittos]], '[[Eric Bellquist]] and the presumption of innocence', ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', 2017-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;
* The obtaining of a [[false confession]] under [[duress]] or [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;Japan Times, 'Justice system flawed by presumed guilt', Keiji Hirano, 13/10/2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[frameup]], usually an admission presumably made under duress. All such admissions should be treated with skepticism without actual video or a signed statement.&lt;ref&gt;Japan Times, 'Justice system flawed by presumed guilt' Keiji Hirano, 13/10/2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[plea bargain]], which in the worst case may induce a guilty party to give [[false testimony]] against an innocent co-accused.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-innocent-people-plead-guilty/2018/01/12/e05d262c-b805-11e7-a908-a3470754bbb9_story.html How to make an innocent plead guilty], Jeffrey Stein, 12/1/2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[fixed penalty notice]] or on-the-spot fine.&lt;ref&gt;Gotham Gazette, 'With parking tickets, New Yorkers are guilty until proven innocent', Emily Jane Goodman, 7/10/2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pre-crime]] policies such as [[preventive detention]].&lt;ref&gt;New York Review, 'How internment became legal', John Townsend Rich, 22/6/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

* [[Racial prejudice]]&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Stevenson, 'A presumption of guilt', [[The New York Review]], 13 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* Impatience and fear of jurors&lt;ref name=Keith_Findley&gt;Keith Findley, 'The presumption of Innocence exists in theory, not reality', [[Washington Post]], 19/1/2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2018}}
* "[[Media frenzy]]"&lt;ref name=Keith_Findley /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/384/333.html|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A "punitive culture"&lt;ref name=Keith_Findley /&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2018}}
* [[Cognitive bias]]&lt;ref name=Keith_Findley /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Stevenson, 'A presumption of guilt', [[The New York Review]], 13 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanbar.org/groups/judicial/publications/judges_journal/2015/fall/cognitive_bias_and_its_impact_on_expert_witnesses_and_the_court/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[mind games|Psychological game-playing]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne Dyer]], ''[[Your Erroneous Zones]]'', Warner Books, 1976, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Berne]], ''[[Games People Play (book)]]'', Penguin 1964, pp 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Apocalypticism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Schell]], ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'', Picador, 1982, p133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Michael Greer, ''Apocalypse'', Quercus, 2012, pp 35, 36, 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in History==
Between 1947 and 1956, many US citizens were accused of being communist agents or sympathisers and had their careers ruined during the era of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Second Red Scare]].  The McCarthyites never proved any of it in court.&lt;ref&gt;[[Don E Carleton]] and [[John Henry Faulk]], ''Red Scare: Right-Wing Hysteria, Fifties Fanaticism, and Their Legacy in Texas'', University of Texas Press, 2014, p. x&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
In 1989, [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], supreme leader of [[Iran]], pronounced a death sentence by [[fatwa]] on [[Salman Rushdie]] and anyone assisting publication of his book, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''; "I call on all Muslims wherever they may be in the world to kill them without delay". The fatwa was condemned for violating [[national sovereignty]], [[freedom of speech]], and the Muslim principle of [[fiqh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Newsweek]], 27 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples in sexual violence and harassment ==
The American actor and producer [[Jeremy Piven]] has spoken out against the [[Me Too movement]], which, he claims, "put lives in jeopardy without a hearing, due process or evidence". Writing about Piven's comment, journalist [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]], suggests that the presumption of innocence, which barrister and writer [[John Mortimer]] described as a "golden thread", is being weakened.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]], [http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-oneill-presumption-innocent-sex-harassment-20171116-story.html "Whatever Happened to the Presumption of Innocence?"], ''Los Angeles Times'', 16 November 2017. Accessed 6 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
High Court judge Sir [[Richard Henriques]] has criticized UK police training and methods which allegedly assert that "only 0.1% of rape allegations are false", and in which all complainants are treated as "victims" from the start. In three cases which later collapsed, including those of Liam Allan and Danny Kay, police withheld vital evidence from the defence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marco Giannangeli]], [https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/896348/police-rape-case-collapse-high-court-judge-officer-training-presumption-of-guilt "Police must stop training 'Presumption of Guilt', says High Court judge"], ''Daily Express'', 24 December 2017. Accessed 6 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to assess the true prevalence of [[False accusation of rape|false rape allegations]], but it is generally agreed that rape accusations are false about 2% to 10% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;DiCanio, M. ''The encyclopedia of violence: origins, attitudes, consequences''. New York: Facts on File, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-2332-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisak, David; Gardinier, Lori; Nicksa, Sarah C.; Cote, Ashley M. (2010).

''Violence Against Women''. 16 (12): 1318–1334. Accessed 7 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internationally==
In [[Japan]] the criminal justice system has been criticized for its wide use of [[Detention (imprisonment)|detentions]], during which suspects were forced to make false confessions during interrogations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keiji Hirano]], "Justice system flawed by presumed guilt", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 13 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics}}

'''Political bias''' is a [[bias]] or perceived bias involving the slanting and altering of information to make a political position or [[political candidate]]s seem more attractive. With a distinct association to [[media bias]], it commonly refers to how a reporter, news organization, or TV show covers [[political candidate]]s and policy issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bias emerges in a political context when individuals engage an inability or unwillingness to understand a politically opposing point of view. Such bias in individuals may have roots in each individual's [[Trait theory|traits]] and thinking styles, and it is not clear whether individuals at particular positions along the political spectrum are more biased than any other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Vyse |first=Stuart |author-link=Stuart Vyse|date=2019 |title=Who Are More Biased: Liberals or Conservatives? |url=https://skepticalinquirer.org/exclusive/who_are_more_biased_liberals_or_conservatives/?/specialarticles/show/who_are_more_biased_liberals_or_conservatives |magazine=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=24–27|access-date=22 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political Bias exists beyond simple presentation and understanding of view-points favouring a particular political leader or party, but rather transcends into the readings and interactions among individuals undertaken on a daily basis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gentzknow|first=Matthew|last2=Shapiro|first2=Jesse|last3=Stone|first3=Daniel|date=2014|title=Media Bias in the Marketplace: Theory|url=|journal=NBER Paper|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prevalence of political bias has a lasting impact with proven effects on voter behaviour and consequent political outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With an understanding of Political Bias, comes acknowledgement of its violation of expected political neutrality.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Lack of Political Neutrality is the result of political bias and further the control mechanism to reduce political bias.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Types of bias in a political context==

[[Bias|Concision bias]]: Refers to perspective reporting that covers views that are quickly explained ad lends little to no time to [[unconventional]], difficult to explain views.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-politicalscience/chapter/media-bias/|title=Media Bias|website=Boundless Political Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concision bias aims to increase communication by selectively focusing on the important information and eliminating redundancy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a political context this can mean the omission of seemingly unnecessary details, however,  those of which can actually constitute bias in itself, depending which information is determined unnecessary.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saez-Trumper|first=Diego|date=|title=Gatekeeping, Coverage and Statement bias|url=|journal=Social Media News Communities|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political opinions are often reduced to a simple party understanding or belief system, with other challenging information excluded in its presentation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Coverage bias: When topics and issues are addresses by political parties to different extents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This makes certain issues seem more prevalent and presenting ideas as more important and necessary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a political atmosphere this is relevant in the presentation of policies and the issues that they are designed to address, along with the actual coverage time from media and politicians&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Confirmation bias|Confirmation bias:]] a cognitive bias that favours and seeks information which affirms pre-existing beliefs and opinions.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plous|first=Scott|date=1993|title=Confirmation Bias|url=|journal=The Psychology of Judgement and Decision Making|volume=|pages=233|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When set in political atmosphere, individuals with likeminded political beliefs will seek and affirm their opinions, discounting contradictory information&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shermer|first=Michael|date=2006|title=The Political Brain|url=|journal=Scientific American|volume=295|issue=1|pages=36|bibcode=2006SciAm.295a..36S|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0706-36|pmid=16830675}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent meta-analysis attempted to compare levels of confirmation bias among liberals and conservatives in the United States and found that both groups were roughly equally biased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1177/1745691617746796|title = At Least Bias Is Bipartisan: A Meta-Analytic Comparison of Partisan Bias in Liberals and Conservatives|journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 273-291|year = 2018|last1 = Ditto|first1 = Peter H.|last2 = Liu|first2 = Brittany S.|last3 = Clark|first3 = Cory J.|last4 = Wojcik|first4 = Sean P.|last5 = Chen|first5 = Eric E.|last6 = Grady|first6 = Rebecca H.|last7 = Celniker|first7 = Jared B.|last8 = Zinger|first8 = Joanne F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[False consensus effect|False consensus bias]]: Exists when the normalisation of an individual's opinions, beliefs and values are believed to be common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117094105/http://www.psychologycampus.com/social-psychology/false-consensus.html|title=False Consensus and False Uniqueness|website=Psychology Campus|access-date=2019-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bias exists in a group setting where the collective group opinion is attributed to the wider population, with little to now inter group challenges.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is the basis of political party formation and engages the ongoing attempt to [[Normalization (sociology)|normalise]] these views within the wider population with little recognition to the different beliefs outside the party.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[wikt:speculative#Adjective|Speculative content]]: When stories focus on what has the potential to occur with speculative phrasing such as “may”, “what if” and “could” rather than focusing on the factual evidence of what has and/or definitely will occur&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;'''.''' This further speculative bias when the piece is not specifically labelled as an opinion and analysis article.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This occurs in a political context particularly in the introduction of policies or the addressing of opposing policies.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/08838157809363907|title = Bias in television news coverage of political events: A methodological analysis|journal = Journal of Broadcasting|volume = 22|issue = 4|pages = 517–530|year = 1978|last1 = Hofstetter|first1 = C. Richard|last2 = Buss|first2 = Terry F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bias allows parties to make their policies more appealing and appear to address issues more directly, by speculating the positive and negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Gatekeeping bias: This type of bias exists through the use of [[ideological]] selection, deselection and/or omission of stories based on individualised opinions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Similarly related to agenda bias, existing primarily when the focus is on politicians and how they choose to cover and present preferred policy discussions and issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Partisan bias on Wikipedia|Partisan bias]]: Exists in the media when reporters serve and create leaning of a particular political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soroka|first=Stuart|date=2016|title=Gatekeeping and Negativity Bias|url=|journal=Political Communication|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political neutrality==
[[Political neutrality]] is the counteraction for political bias, looking to ensure the ability of public servants to carry out any official duties in an impartial manner, relative to their political beliefs.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kernaghan|first=Kenneth|date=1986|title=Political Rights and Political Neutrality: finding the bland point|url=|journal=Canadian Public Administration|volume=|pages=639–652|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas such as media coverage, legal and bureaucratic decisions and academic teachings, the need for taking corrective action against politically biased actions is the foundation of political neutrality enforcement.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yair|first=Omer|date=2018|title=When do we care about political neutrality? The hypocritical nature of reaction to political bias|url=|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that political neutrality is favoured over political bias, with [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], [[Independent politician|Independents]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]' preferring to get their news sources from politically neutral media.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Individuals responses to political bias and motivations are challenged when the engagement of bias furthers and assists their political party or ideology.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The denunciation of political neutrality itself elicits a more aggravated response, directly controlling a normative acceptance of Political Bias.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Limitations of [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196674 political neutrality] exist regarding [[media coverage]] and generate accusations for any actions or messages perceived as politically biased.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Biases remain embedded in contextual intergroup competition, meaning political considerations based on action or message can challenge specific ideologies or further enhance and advance an ideology.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Political bias and framing==
Political bias exists primarily in the concept of framing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]] is the social construction of political or social movements in a positive or negative representation.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheufele|first=Dietram|date=1999|title=Framing as a Theory of Media Effects|url=|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=49|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political bias in this context is political leaders and parties presenting information to highlight a problem and offering solutions that favour their own political position.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Entman|first=Robert|date=2010|title=Media framing biases and political power: Explaining slant in news of Campaign 2008|url=|journal=Journalism: Theory, Practice and Criticism|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes their personal position appear more favourable and their policies as the expected course of action.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[framing effect]] looks at the situations in which people are only presented with options within two frames, one presented negatively and the other positively.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druckman|first=James|date=2001|title=On the Limits of Framing Effects: Who can Frame?|url=|journal=Political Science|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framing effect is increasingly significant in opinion polls designed to encourage specific organisations that are commissioned to poll.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; If reliable, credible and sufficient information is provided, this bias can be significantly reduced.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Framing further looks at the impact of slanting in political campaigning and its potential impact of the distribution of political power where political bias is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Entman|first=Robert|date=2008|title=Media framing biases and political power: Explaining slant in news of Campaign 2008|url=|journal= Journalism: Theory, Practice &amp; Criticism|volume=11|issue=4|pages=389–408|doi=10.1177/1464884910367587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through understanding of Framing as an omnipresent process used in analysis to discern connections between aspects of reality and convey an interpretation of opinions that may not be entirely accurate.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Evidence of political bias in search engines==
Opinions and perceptions of political issues and candidates are often shaped by search results from search engines like google.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canirank.com/analysis-of-political-bias-in-internet-search-engine-results/|title=Study: Does Google have a Political Bias?|last=Bentley|first=Matt|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Algorithm updates in 2017|Google algorithms]] are not designed to provide balanced or equal representation of controversial issues.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Search engines influence democracy due to the potential distrust of media, increasing online searches for political information and understanding.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Looking specifically at America, the [[FCC fairness doctrine|Fairness Doctrine]] was introduced in 1949 to avoid political bias in all licensed Broadcasting mediums.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patterson|first=Thomas|date=2013|title=The News Media: Communicating Political Images|url=|journal=We the People|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of [[political polarization|polarizing]] topics such as political bias, the top search results can play a significant role in shaping opinions.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernhardt|first=Dan|date=2007|title=Political Polarization and the Electoral Effects of Media Bias|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the use of a [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10791-018-9341-2 bias quantification framework], bias can be measured within the political bias by rank, within the search system but further address the sources of the bias through the input data and ranking system.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kulshrestha|first=Juhi|date=2018|title=Search bias quantification: investigating political bias in social media and web search|url=|journal=Information Retrieval Journal|volume=22|issue=1–2|pages=188–227|doi=10.1007/s10791-018-9341-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of information queries, the search results are determined through a ranking system which in the case of topics such as Politics, can return politically biased search results.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This bias present in the search results can be a direct result of either biased data that collaborates the ranking system or because of the structure of the ranking system itself.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This questionable nature of search results raises questions of impact on users and to what degree the ranking system can impact political opinions and beliefs, which can directly translate into voter behavior.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This can also affirm or encourage biased data within the google search results.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Whilst research has shown that users do not place exclusive trust on the information provided by search engines,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; studies have shown that individuals that are undecided politically are susceptible to be manipulated by bias relative to political candidates and the light in which their policies and actions are presented and conveyed.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In the quantification of political bias, both the input data for search results and further the ranking system in which they are presented to the user encapsulate bias to varying degrees.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

There is further distinctive political bias present in social media where the algorithm which structures user content, facilitates confirmation bias.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This involves presenting political information dependent on common searches and focuses of the users which further re-affirms political bias and reduces exposure to politically neutral content.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Determining the difference between content and source bias is a significant focus of determining the role of political bias in search engines.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This focus looks directly at the actual content of the information present and whether it is purposefully selective in the information presented, or rather whether the source of the information is projecting personalised opinions relative to their political opinions.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Political bias in the media==
[[Media bias]] highlights political bias in the reporting of political topics and representation of politicians&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;'''.''' Where a reporter emphasises particular points of view and conveys selected information to further their own political view, they present biased information favouring their own [[Freedom of thought|political opinion]].&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stromberg|first=David|date=2002|title=Mass Media Competition, Political Competition, and Public Policy|url=|journal=Institute for International Economic Studies|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining media biases relative to political positioning, there are distinctive regulations which protect against the fabrication of information.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The media, rather, alters the representation of information to promote political positions.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Alteration of political opinions, which directly impact voter behavior and decisions, can be altered under media bias due to the failed representation of information.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This form of political bias has continuing impacts when used to change opinions of others.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Where media remains a powerful information source for political information, it can create political bias in the informational representation of policy issues.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;[[File:Media Bias Study Table.gif|thumb|Use of media to further political bias]]

An example of quantification of political bias in the media is [[Propaganda model|a propaganda model]], a concept introduced by [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]]. It is a [[political economy]] model, looking at the “manufacturing” of political policies through manipulation of mass media.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Citation|last=Robinson|first=Piers|chapter=Does the Propaganda Model Actually Theorise Propaganda?|date=2018-10-25|pages=53–67|publisher=University of Westminster Press|isbn=9781912656165|doi=10.16997/book27.e|title=The Propaganda Model Today: Filtering Perception and Awareness}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model further looked at the capital funding of Media outlets and their ownership, which often relates political ties.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Political bias in the media is also discussed in how social leaders discuss political issues.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; To determine the existence of political bias, agenda determination is used.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Agenda determination is designed to provide an understanding of the agenda behind presentation of political issues and attempt to determine the political bias that is present.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Within a 2002 study by [[Jim A. Kuypers]] : ''Press Bias and Politics: How the Media Frame Controversial Issues'',&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuypers|first=Jim|date=2002|title=Press Bias and Politics: How the Media Frame Controversial Issues|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuypers looks at the omission of left leaning points of view from the mainstream print press.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Kuypers determined that Politicians would receive positive press coverage only when covering and delivering topics that aligned with press-supported beliefs.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; This meant the press were engaging in bias within the media through their coverage and selection/release of political information which was challenging the neutral conveyance of political messages.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; 

David Baron similarly presents a [https://www.wiley.com/en-au/Game+Theory%3A+An+Introduction%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781118533895 game-theoretic model] of media behaviour,&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baron|first=David|date=April 2013|title=Game Theory: An Introduction|url=|journal=Wiley|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that mass media outlets only hire journalists whose writing is aligned with their political positions.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; This engages false consensus bias, as beliefs are determined to be common due to the surrounding of aligned views. This effectively heightens the political bias within media representation of information.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

== Attempts to counteract political bias==
The [[Media Research Center|Media Research Center]] is an American media watch group, with specific focus on the presence of politically biased content.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mrc.org/about|title=About the MRC|last=wonder95|date=2015-09-29|website=Media Research Center|access-date=2019-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated mission is to “expose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the left”.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The Media Research Center currently operates numerous projects aimed at calling attention to political bias in the media and ensuring it is correctly identified.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; More specifically, MRC releases a newsletter called ''CyberAlert'' aimed at profiling any inaccurate reports about politics within the news media, specific to America.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; It is written by editor [[Brent Baker]], who further addresses media articles as potentially biased articles by labeling them ''BIASALERT''&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;''.'' The analysis of political bias in the media is determined through collaboration with ''Media Reality Check'', which specifically aims to combat liberal bias and reporting.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; In 2005, Media Research Center developed a website called [[Newsbusters|NewsBusters]], which acts as a blog for analysis of stories where political bias has been flagged.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; It further operates on a more personal note, not only calling out bias in articles, but further challenging the authors of said articles as to their politically biased writing.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Further in the United States, bias now needs to be disclosed as a conflict of interest when addressing political parties, candidates and policies.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plaisance|first=Patrick|date=August 2006|title=Transparency: An Assessment of the Kantian Roots of a Key Element in Media Ethics Practice|journal=Journal of Mass Media Ethics|volume=21|issue=2&amp;3|pages=|doi=10.1207/jmme.2006.21.issue-2&amp;3|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This addresses that individuals will hold different political opinions and have vested interests in different political topics, however that degree of bias must be disclosed so that the conflict of interest and presence of bias is understood.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;{{Biases|state=expanded}}{{Navbox

Political theory also engages questions of a broader scope, tackling the political nature of phenomena and categories such as [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[Cultural studies|culture]], [[Queer theory|sexuality]], [[Critical race theory|race]], [[Political economy|wealth]], [[Critical animal studies|human-nonhuman relations]], [[Ecosophy|ecology]], [[Political theology|religion]], and more. 

Political philosophy is a branch of [[philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Leo (1959). An introduction to Political Philosophy. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; but it has also been a major part of [[political science]], within which a strong focus has historically been placed on both the history of political thought and contemporary political theory (from [[Normative|normative political theory]] to various [[Critical theory|critical approaches]]). 

In the ''Oxford Handbook in Political Theory'' (2006), the field is described as: "[...] an interdisciplinary endeavor whose center of gravity lies at the humanities end of the happily still undisciplined discipline of political science ... For a long time, the challenge for the identity of political theory has been how to position itself productively in three sorts of location: in relation to the academic disciplines of political science, history, and philosophy; between the world of politics and the more abstract, ruminative register of theory; between canonical political theory and the newer resources (such as [[Feminist theory|feminist]] and [[critical theory]], [[discourse analysis]], film and [[film theory]], [[Popular culture studies|popular]] and political culture, [[Media studies|mass media studies]], [[Neuropolitics|neuroscience]], [[environmental studies]], [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral science]], and [[economics]]) on which political theorists increasingly draw."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-09-02|editor-last=Dryzek|editor-first=John S.|editor2-last=Honig|editor2-first=Bonnie|editor3-last=Phillips|editor3-first=Anne|title=The Oxford Handbook of Political Theory|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199548439.001.0001|isbn=9780199548439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient traditions ===

==== Ancient India ====
[[Indian political philosophy]]  in ancient times demarcated a clear distinction between (1) nation and state (2) religion and state. The constitutions of Hindu states evolved over time and were based on political and legal treatises and prevalent social institutions. The institutions of state were broadly divided into governance, administration, defense, law and order. ''Mantranga,'' the principal governing body of these states, consisted of the King, Prime Minister, Commander in chief of army, Chief Priest of the King. The Prime Minister headed the committee of ministers along with head of executive (Maha Amatya).

[[Chanakya]] was a 4th-century BC Indian political philosopher. The ''[[Arthashastra]]'' provides an account of the science of politics for a wise ruler, policies for foreign affairs and wars, the system of a spy state and surveillance and economic stability of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Roger Boesche|last=Boesche|first=Roger|title=The First Great Political Realist: Kautilya and His Arthashastra|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K85NA7Rg67wC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0739106074&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2002|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-0401-9|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanakya quotes several authorities including Bruhaspati, Ushanas, Prachetasa Manu, Parasara, and Ambi, and described himself as a descendant of a lineage of political philosophers, with his father Chanaka being his immediate predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rangarajan|first1=L N|title=The Arthashastra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3jbzZkoR36QC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PT22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2000|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9788184750119|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential extant Indian treatise on political philosophy is the Sukra Neeti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=D.

==== Ancient China ====
{{see also|Ancient Chinese political systems}}
[[File:Konfuzius-1770.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Confucius]], c. 1770]]

Chinese political philosophy dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]], specifically with Confucius in the 6th century BC. Chinese political philosophy was developed as a response to the social and political breakdown of the country characteristic of the Spring and Autumn period and the [[Warring States period]]. The major philosophies during the period, [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Mohism]], [[School of Agrarianism|Agrarianism]] and [[Taoism]], each had a political aspect to their philosophical schools. Philosophers such as [[Confucius]], [[Mencius]], and [[Mozi]], focused on political unity and political stability as the basis of their political philosophies. Confucianism advocated a hierarchical, [[meritocracy|meritocratic]] government based on empathy, loyalty, and interpersonal relationships. Legalism advocated a highly [[authoritarian]] government based on [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] punishments and laws. [[Mohism]] advocated a communal, decentralized government centered on [[frugality]] and [[ascetism]]. The Agrarians advocated a peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deutsch|first=Eliot|author2=Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999|page=183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taoism advocated a proto-[[anarchism]]. Legalism was the dominant political philosophy of the [[Qin Dynasty]], but was replaced by State Confucianism in the [[Han Dynasty]]. Prior to China's adoption of [[communism]], State Confucianism remained the dominant political philosophy of China up to the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsü|first=Leonard Shihlien|title=The political philosophy of Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FWFtQIyun-8C|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-36154-5|pages=xvii–xx|quote=The importance of a scientific study of Confucian political philosophy could hardly be overstated.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ancient Greece ====
Western political philosophy originates in the philosophy of [[ancient Greece]], where political philosophy dates back to at least [[Plato]].&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahakian|first=Mabel Lewis|title=Ideas of the great philosophers|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vi7cQMw8SwYC&amp;pg=PA59|year=1993|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Publishing|isbn=978-1-56619-271-2|page=59|quote=... Western philosophical tradition can be traced back as early as Plato (427–347 BC).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greece was dominated by city-states, which experimented with various forms of political organization, grouped by Plato into five categories of descending stability and morality: [[monarchy]], [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[tyranny]]. One of the first, extremely important classical works of political philosophy is Plato's ''Republic'',&lt;ref name="Sahakian 1993 59"/&gt; which was followed by [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kraut|first=Richard|title=Aristotle: political philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9BDmX3FBbS4C&amp;pg=PA3|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-878200-1|page=3|quote=To understand and assess Aristotle's contributions to political thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman political philosophy was influenced by the [[Stoics]] and the Roman statesman [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radford|first=Robert T.|title=Cicero: a study in the origins of republican philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1cKLGcvuYxQC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2002|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1467-1|page=1|quote=His most lasting political contribution is in his work on political philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Saint Augustine ====

The early [[Christian philosophy]] of [[Augustine of Hippo]] was heavily influenced by Plato. A key change brought about by Christian thought was the moderation of the [[Stoicism]] and theory of [[justice]] of the Roman world, as well emphasis on the role of the state in applying [[mercy]] as a [[moral example]]. Augustine also preached that one was not a member of his or her city, but was either a citizen of the [[City of God (book)|City of God]] (Civitas Dei) or the City of Man ([[Civitas]] Terrena). Augustine's ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' is an influential work of this period that attacked the thesis, held by many Christian Romans, that the Christian view could be realized on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schall|first=James V.|title=At the Limits of Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yZK79kiFFtsC&amp;pg=PA40|year=1998|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-0922-7|page=40|quote=In political philosophy, St. Augustine was a follower of Plato ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== St. Thomas Aquinas ====
{{main|Treatise on Law}}

[[Thomas Aquinas]] meticulously dealt with the varieties of [[philosophy of law]]. According to Aquinas, there are four kinds of law:

# Eternal law ("the divine government of everything")
# [[Divine law|Divine positive law]] (having been "posited" by God; external to human nature)
# [[Natural law]] (the right way of living discoverable by natural reason; what cannot-not be known; internal to human nature)
# Human law (what we commonly call "[[law]]"—including [[customary law]]; the law of the ''[[Communitas Perfecta]]'')

Aquinas never discusses the nature or categorization of [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]. There is scholarly debate surrounding the place of canon law within the Thomistic jurisprudential framework.

Aquinas was an incredibly influential thinker in the [[Natural law|Natural Law tradition]].

The rise of [[Islam]], based on both the [[Qur'an]] and [[Muhammad]] strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. [[Early Islamic philosophy]] emphasized an inexorable link between [[science]] and [[religion]], and the process of [[ijtihad]] to find [[truth]]—in effect ''all'' philosophy was "[[Political aspects of Islam|political]]" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the "rationalist" [[Mutazilite]] philosophers, who held a more [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenic]] view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the [[Caliphate]]. By the late ancient period, however, the "traditionalist" [[Asharite]] view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aslan|first=Reza|authorlink=Reza Aslan|title=No god but God|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AkyupJn81RMC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2005|publisher=Random House Inc.|isbn=978-1-58836-445-6|page=153|quote=By the ninth and tenth centuries... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic philosophy|Islamic political philosophy]], was, indeed, rooted in the very sources of [[Islam]]—i.e., the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]], the words and practices of Muhammad—thus making it essentially theocratic. However, in Western thought, it is generally supposed that it was a specific area peculiar merely to the great philosophers of Islam: [[al-Kindi]] (Alkindus), [[al-Farabi]] (Abunaser), [[Avicenna|İbn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace) and [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes). The political conceptions of Islam such as kudrah (power), [[sultan]], [[ummah]], cemaa (obligation)-and even the "core" terms of the Qur'an—i.e., [[ibadah]] (worship), din (religion), rab (master) and [[ilah]] (deity)—is taken as the basis of an analysis. Hence, not only the ideas of the Muslim political philosophers but also many other [[Fiqh|jurists]] and [[Ulema|ulama]] posed political ideas and theories. For example, the ideas of the [[Kharijites|Khawarij]] in the very early years of [[Muslim history|Islamic history]] on [[Caliphate|Khilafa]] and [[Ummah]], or that of [[Shia Islam]] on the concept of [[Imamah]] are considered proofs of political thought. The clashes between the [[Sunni Islam|Ehl-i Sunna]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] in the 7th and 8th centuries had a genuine political character. Political thought was not purely rooted in theism, however. [[Aristotelianism|Aristotleanism]] flourished as the Islamic Golden Age saw rise to a continuation of the [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]] philosophers who implemented the ideas of [[Aristotle]] in the context of the Islamic world. Abunaser, Avicenna and Ibn Rushd where part of this philosophical school who claimed that human reason surpassed mere coincidence and revelation. They believed, for example, that natural phenomena occur because of certain rules (made by god), not because god interfered directly (unlike Al-Ghazali and his followers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Farabi|title=Al-Fārābī {{!}} Muslim philosopher|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/avicenna/#H5|title=Avicenna (Ibn Sina) {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Ghazali|title=Al-Ghazālī {{!}} Muslim jurist, theologian, and mystic|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable political philosophers of the time include [[Nizam al-Mulk]], a Persian scholar and [[vizier]] of the Seljuq Empire who composed the ''[[Siyasatnama]]'', or the "Book of Government" in English. In it, he details the role of the state in terms of political affairs (i.e. how to deal with political opponents without ruining the government's image), as well as its duty to protect the poor and reward the worthy. In his other work, he explains how the state should deal with other issues such as supplying jobs to immigrants like the [[Turkmens]] who were coming from the north (present day southern Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nizam-al-Mulk-Seljuq-vizier|title=Niẓām al-Mulk {{!}} Seljuq vizier|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ibn Khaldun ====

The 14th-century [[Arab]] scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]] is considered one of the greatest political theorists. The British philosopher-anthropologist [[Ernest Gellner]] considered Ibn Khaldun's definition of [[government]], "...an institution which prevents injustice other than such as it commits itself," the best in the history of political theory. For Ibn Khaldun, government should be restrained to a minimum for as a necessary evil, it is the constraint of men by other men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gellner|first=Ernest|authorlink=Ernest Gellner|title=Plough, Sword, and Book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WwduQjFiB7kC&amp;pg=PA239|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28702-7|page=239|quote=Ibn Khaldun's definition of government probably remains the best: ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval Europe ===
[[Medieval]] political philosophy in Europe was heavily influenced by Christian thinking. It had much in common with the Mutazilite [[Islamic]] thinking in that the [[Roman Catholic]]s thought subordinating [[philosophy]] to [[theology]] did not subject reason to revelation but in the case of contradictions, subordinated reason to faith as the Asharite of Islam. The Scholastics by combining the philosophy of Aristotle with the Christianity of St. Augustine emphasized the potential harmony inherent in reason and revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koetsier|first=L.S.|title=Natural Law and Calvinist Political Theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7uLE3DynB0YC&amp;pg=PA19|year=2004|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4122-1440-7|page=19|quote=...the Medieval Scholastics revived the concept of natural law. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most influential political philosopher of medieval Europe was St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] who helped reintroduce [[Aristotle]]'s works, which had only been transmitted to [[Catholic]] Europe through [[Muslim]] Spain, along with the commentaries of [[Averroes]]. Aquinas's use of them set the agenda, for [[scholasticism|scholastic]] political philosophy dominated European thought for centuries even unto the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA346|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|page=346|quote=There was, however, at least one department of thought ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some medieval political philosophers, such as Aquinas in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', developed the idea that a king who is a tyrant is no king at all and could be overthrown. Others, like [[Nicole Oresme]] in his ''[[Livre de Politiques]]'', categorically denied this right to overthrow an unjust ruler.

The [[Magna Carta]], viewed by many as a cornerstone of Anglo-American political liberty, explicitly proposes the right to revolt against the ruler for justice's sake. Other documents similar to Magna Carta are found in other European countries such as Spain and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Valente|first=Claire|title=The theory and practice of revolt in medieval England|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B8yRrtm0LicC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-0901-8|page=14|quote=The two starting points of most medieval discussions ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Renaissance ===
During the [[Renaissance]] secular political philosophy began to emerge after about a century of theological political thought in Europe. While the Middle Ages did see secular politics in practice under the rule of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the academic field was wholly [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] and therefore Christian in nature.

==== Niccolò Machiavelli ====

One of the most influential works during this burgeoning period was [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'', written between 1511–12 and published in 1532, after Machiavelli's death. That work, as well as ''[[Discorsi sopra la prima deca di Tito Livio|The Discourses]]'', a rigorous analysis of [[classical antiquity]], did much to influence modern political thought in the West. A minority (including [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]) interpreted The Prince as a satire meant to be given to the Medici after their recapture of Florence and their subsequent expulsion of Machiavelli from Florence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Ian|title=Lecture on Machiavelli's The Prince|publisher=[[Malaspina University College]]|date=February 2002|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/introser/machiavelli.htm|accessdate=2007-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the work was written for the di Medici family in order to perhaps influence them to free him from exile, Machiavelli supported the [[Republic of Florence]] rather than the [[oligarchy]] of the di [[Medici]] family. At any rate, Machiavelli presents a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] and somewhat [[consequentialist]] view of politics, whereby good and evil are mere means used to bring about an end—i.e., the acquisition and maintenance of absolute power. [[Thomas Hobbes]], well known for his theory of the [[social contract]], goes on to expand this view at the start of the 17th century during the [[English Renaissance]]. Although neither Machiavelli nor Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, they both believed in the inherent selfishness of the individual. It was necessarily this belief that led them to adopt a strong central power as the only means of preventing the disintegration of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copleston|first=Frederick|title=A history of philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y_382o-fpOsC&amp;pg=PA310|volume=3|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-86012-296-8|pages=310–12|quote=...we witness the growth of political absolutism ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Enlightenment ===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|right|upright=1.45|thumb|Eugène Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830, Louvre), a painting created at a time when old and modern political philosophies came into violent conflict.]]During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, new theories emerged about what the human was and is and about the definition of reality and the way it was perceived, along with the discovery of other societies in the Americas, and the changing needs of political societies (especially in the wake of the [[English Civil War]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]]), and the [[Haitian Revolution]]. These new theories led to new questions and insights by such thinkers as [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].

These theorists were driven by two basic questions: one, by what right or need do people form states; and two, what the best form for a state could be. These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of "state" and "government." It was decided that "state" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term "government" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in [[political science]], although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of [[natural order (philosophy)|natural order]] was not introduced, the [[social sciences]] could not evolve independently of [[theistic]] thinking. Since the cultural revolution of the 17th century in England, which spread to France and the rest of Europe, society has been considered subject to natural laws akin to the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barens|first1=Ingo|last2=Caspari|first2=Volker|last3=Schefold|first3=Bertram|editor1-last=Barens|editor1-first=Ingo|others=Volker Caspari ed., Bertram Schefold ed.|title=Political events and economic ideas|url=https://books.google.com/?id=x6C5AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA206|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84542-152-6|pages=206–07|quote=Economic theory as political philosophy: the example of the French Enlightenment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and economic relations were drastically influenced by these theories as the concept of the [[guild]] was subordinated to the theory of [[free trade]], and [[Roman Catholic]] dominance of theology was increasingly challenged by [[Protestant]] churches subordinate to each [[nation-state]], which also (in a fashion the Roman Catholic Church often decried angrily) preached in the vulgar or native language of each region. Free trade, as apposed to these religious theories, is a trade policy that does not restrict imports or exports. It can also be understood as the free market idea applied to international trade. In government, free trade is predominantly advocated by political parties that hold liberal economic positions while economically left-wing and nationalist political parties generally support protectionism, the opposite of free trade. However, the enlightenment was an outright attack on religion, particularly Christianity. The most outspoken critic of the church in France was [[François Marie Arouet de Voltaire]], a representative figure of the enlightenment.

Historians have described Voltaire's description of the history of Christianity as "propagandistic".Voltaire is partially responsible for the misattribution of the expression Credo quia absurdum to the Church Fathers. In a letter to Frederick II, King of Prussia, dated 5 January 1767, he wrote about Christianity: La nôtre [religion] est sans contredit la plus ridicule, la plus absurde, et la plus sanguinaire qui ait jamais infecté le monde.
"Ours [i.e., the Christian religion] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world. Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think. ... My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out."[ After Voltaire, religion would never be the same again in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=James M.|title=Religion and the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FcEy8SF63TgC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1997|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25760-6|pages=1–2|quote=... there emerged groups of freethinkers intent on grounding knowledge on the exercise of critical reason, as opposed to ... established religion ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], these ideological reforms did not take place and these views did not integrate into common thought until much later. known in Western Europe as the Turkish Empire or simply Turkey, was a state and caliphate that controlled much of Southeast Europe, Western Asia and North Africa between the 14th and early 20th centuries. It was founded at the end of the 13th century in northwestern Anatolia in the town of Söğüt (modern-day Bilecik Province) by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman I.[19] Although initially the dynasty was of Turkic origin, it was Persianised in terms of language, culture, literature and habits.

As well, there was no spread of this doctrine within the [[New World]] and the advanced civilizations of the [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Inca]], [[Mohican]], Delaware, [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and especially the [[Iroquois]]. The [[Iroquois]] philosophy in particular gave much to Christian thought of the time and in many cases actually inspired some of the institutions adopted in the United States: for example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a great admirer of some of the methods of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], and much of early American literature emphasized the political philosophy of the natives.The Iroquois (/ˈɪrəkwɔɪ/ or /ˈɪrəkwɑː/) or Haudenosaunee are a historically powerful northeast Native American confederacy in North America. They were known during the colonial years to the French as the Iroquois League, and later as the Iroquois Confederacy, and to the English as the Five Nations, comprising the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca. After 1722, they accepted the Tuscarora people from the Southeast into their confederacy, as they were also Iroquoian-speaking, and became known as the Six Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johansen|first=Bruce Elliott|title=Native American political systems and the evolution of democracy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H593mgxQNu4C&amp;pg=PA69|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30010-3|page=69|quote=... the three-tier system of federalism ... is an inheritance of Iroquois inspiration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== John Locke ====

[[John Locke]] in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir [[Robert Filmer]]'s paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the [[divine right of kings]] became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from [[original sin]], Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as [[tabula rasa]]. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.

==== John Stuart Mill ====

[[John Stuart Mill]]'s work on political philosophy begins in ''On Liberty, On Liberty'' is the most influential statement of his liberal principles. He begins by distinguishing old and new threats to liberty. The old threat to liberty is found in traditional societies in which there is rule by one (a monarchy) or a few (an aristocracy). Though one could be worried about restrictions on liberty by benevolent monarchs or aristocrats, the traditional worry is that when rulers are politically unaccountable to the governed they will rule in their own interests, rather than the interests of the governed. Mill’s explicit theory of rights is introduced in Chapter V of Utilitarianism in the context of his sanction theory of duty, which is an indirect form of utilitarianism that identifies wrong actions as actions that it is useful to sanction. Mill then introduces justice as a proper part of duty. Justice involves duties that are perfect duties—that is, duties that are correlated with rights.
Justice implies something which it is not only right to do, and wrong not to do, but which some individual person can claim from us as a matter of right. These perfect duties will thus create liberty and collective freedom within a state.
He uses, ''On Liberty'' to discuss gender equality in a society. To Mill, Utilitarianism was the perfect tool to justify gender equality in The Subjection of Women, referring to the political, lawful and social subjection of women. When a woman was married, she entered a legally binding coverture with her husband; once she married her legal existence as an individual was suspended under “marital unity” . While it is easy to presume that a woman would not marry under these circumstances, being unmarried had social consequences. A woman could only advance in social stature and wealth if she had a rich husband to do the groundwork. Mill uses his Utilitarian ethics to assess how gender equality would be the best way to achieve “the greatest good for the greatest number” :
“The principle that regulates the existing social relations between the two sexes … and is now one of the chief obstacles to human improvement…” 

The ‘chief obstacle’ to Mill relates to women’s intellectual capability. The Subjection of Women looks at this in the women of society and argues that diminishing their intellectual potential wastes the knowledge and skill of half of the population; such knowledge lost could formulate ideas which could maximise pleasure for society.

==== Benjamin Constant ====

''Main article: The Liberty of Ancients Compared with that of Moderns''

One of the first thinkers to go by the name of "liberal", Constant looked to Britain rather than to ancient Rome for a practical model of freedom in a large, commercial society. He drew a distinction between the "Liberty of the Ancients" and the "Liberty of the Moderns". The Liberty of the Ancients was a participatory republican liberty, which gave the citizens the right to directly influence politics through debates and votes in the public assembly. In order to support this degree of participation, citizenship was a burdensome moral obligation requiring a considerable investment of time and energy. Generally, this required a sub-society of slaves to do much of the productive work, leaving the citizens free to deliberate on public affairs. Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous societies, in which the people could be conveniently gathered together in one place to transact public affairs.

The Liberty of the Moderns, in contrast, was based on the possession of civil liberties, the rule of law, and freedom from excessive state interference. Direct participation would be limited: a necessary consequence of the size of modern states, and also the inevitable result of having created a commercial society in which there are no slaves but almost everybody must earn a living through work. Instead, the voters would elect representatives, who would deliberate in Parliament on behalf of the people and would save citizens from the necessity of daily political involvement.

Moreover, Constant believed that, in the modern world, commerce was superior to war. He attacked Napoleon's martial appetite, on the grounds that it was illiberal and no longer suited to modern commercial social organization. Ancient Liberty tended to be warlike, whereas a state organised on the principles of Modern Liberty would be at peace with all peaceful nations.

==== Thomas Hobbes ====

The main practical conclusion of Hobbes' political theory is that state or society can not be secure unless at the disposal of an absolute sovereign. From this follows the view that no individual can hold rights of property against the sovereign, and that the sovereign may therefore take the goods of its subjects without their consent.

In Leviathan, Hobbes set out his doctrine of the foundation of states and legitimate governments and creating an objective science of morality.[citation needed] Much of the book is occupied with demonstrating the necessity of a strong central authority to avoid the evil of discord and civil war.

Beginning from a mechanistic understanding of human beings and their passions, Hobbes postulates what life would be like without government, a condition which he calls the state of nature. In that state, each person would have a right, or license, to everything in the world. This, Hobbes argues, would lead to a "war of all against all".

==== Jean-Jacques Rousseau ====

''The Social Contract'' outlines the basis for a legitimate political order within a framework of classical republicanism. Published in 1762, it became one of the most influential works of political philosophy in the Western tradition. It developed some of the ideas mentioned in an earlier work, the article Économie Politique (Discourse on Political Economy), featured in Diderot's Encyclopédie. The treatise begins with the dramatic opening lines, "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. Those who think themselves the masters of others are indeed greater slaves than they."

Rousseau claimed that the state of nature was a primitive condition without law or morality, which human beings left for the benefits and necessity of cooperation. As society developed, the division of labor and private property required the human race to adopt institutions of law. In the degenerate phase of society, man is prone to be in frequent competition with his fellow men while also becoming increasingly dependent on them. This double pressure threatens both his survival and his freedom.

=== Industrialization and the Modern Era ===
The [[Karl Marx|Marxist]] critique of capitalism—developed with [[Friedrich Engels]]—was, alongside liberalism and fascism, one of the defining ideological movements of the twentieth century. The [[industrial revolution]] produced a parallel revolution in political thought. [[Urbanization]] and [[capitalism]] greatly reshaped society. During this same period, the [[History of Socialism|socialist movement]] began to form. In the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] was developed, and [[socialism]] in general gained increasing popular support, mostly from the urban working class. Without breaking entirely from the past, Marx established principles that would be used by future revolutionaries of the 20th century namely [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Fidel Castro]]. Though [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s philosophy of history is similar to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s, and [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of revolution towards the common good is partly based on Kant's view of history—Marx declared that he was turning Hegel's dialectic, which was "standing on its head", "the right side up again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/p3.htm|title=Capital Volume One, Afterword to the Second German Edition|last=Marx|first=Karl|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Marx who believed in [[historical materialism]], Hegel believed in the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kain|first=Philip J.|title=Marx and modern political theory|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kvG8DVBeT9QC&amp;pg=PA1|year=1993|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-7866-2|pages=1–4|quote=Some of his texts, especially the ''Communist Manifesto'' made him seem like a sort of communist Descartes ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 19th century, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]]s were established members of the political landscape. In addition, the various branches of [[anarchism]], with thinkers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] or [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[syndicalism]] also gained some prominence. In the Anglo-American world, [[anti-imperialism]] and [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] began gaining currency at the turn of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|reason=Pluralism possibly earlier|date=April 2017}}

[[World War I]] was a watershed event in human history, changing views of governments and politics. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] (and similar, albeit less successful, revolutions in many other European countries) brought [[communism]]—and in particular the political theory of [[Leninism]], but also on a smaller level [[Luxemburgism]] (gradually)—on the world stage. At the same time, [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties won elections and formed governments for the first time, often as a result of the introduction of [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aspalter|first=Christian|title=Importance of Christian and Social Democratic movements in welfare politics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vouKut-RAYoC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2001|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=978-1-56072-975-4|page=70|quote=The pressing need for universal suffrage ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary ==
From the end of [[World War II]] until 1971, when [[John Rawls]] published ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', political philosophy declined in the Anglo-American academic world, as analytic philosophers expressed skepticism about the possibility that normative judgments had cognitive content, and political science turned toward statistical methods and [[behavioralism]]. In continental Europe, on the other hand, the postwar decades saw a huge blossoming of political philosophy, with [[Marxism]] dominating the field. This was the time of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Louis Althusser]], and the victories of [[Mao Zedong]] in China and [[Fidel Castro]] in Cuba, as well as the events of May 1968 led to increased interest in revolutionary ideology, especially by the [[New Left]]. A number of continental European émigrés to Britain and the United States—including [[Karl Popper]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[Judith Shklar]]—encouraged continued study in political philosophy in the Anglo-American world, but in the 1950s and 1960s they and their students remained at odds with the analytic establishment.

[[Communism]] remained an important focus especially during the 1950s and 1960s. [[Colonialism]] and [[racism]] were important issues that arose. In general, there was a marked trend towards a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] approach to political issues, rather than a philosophical one. Much academic debate regarded one or both of two pragmatic topics: how (or whether) to apply [[utilitarianism]] to problems of political policy, or how (or whether) to apply economic models (such as [[rational choice theory]]) to political issues. The rise of [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements]] and the end of colonial rule and of the political exclusion of such minorities as [[African Americans]] and sexual minorities in the developed world has led to feminist, [[postcolonial]], and [[multicultural]] thought becoming significant. This led to a challenge to the [[social contract]] by philosophers [[Charles W. Mills]] in his book ''[[The Racial Contract]]'' and [[Carole Pateman]] in her book ''[[The Sexual Contract]]'' that the social contract excluded persons of colour and women respectively.

In Anglo-American academic political philosophy, the publication of [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971 is considered a milestone. Rawls used a [[thought experiment]], the [[original position]], in which representative parties choose principles of justice for the basic structure of society from behind a veil of ignorance. Rawls also offered a criticism of utilitarian approaches to questions of political justice. [[Robert Nozick]]'s 1974 book ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', which won a [[National Book Award]], responded to Rawls from a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] perspective and gained academic respectability for libertarian viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis Schaefer, [http://www.nysun.com/sports/reconsiderations-robert-nozick-and-coast-utopia Robert Nozick and the Coast of Utopia], [[The New York Sun]], April 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporaneously with the rise of analytic ethics in Anglo-American thought, in Europe several new lines of philosophy directed at critique of existing societies arose between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of these took elements of Marxist economic analysis, but combined them with a more cultural or ideological emphasis. Out of the [[Frankfurt School]], thinkers like [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]] combined Marxian and Freudian perspectives. Along somewhat different lines, a number of other continental thinkers—still largely influenced by Marxism—put new emphases on [[structuralism]] and on a "return to [[Hegel]]". Within the (post-) structuralist line (though mostly not taking that label) are thinkers such as [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Claude Lefort]], and [[Jean Baudrillard]]. The [[Situationist International|Situationists]] were more influenced by Hegel; [[Guy Debord]], in particular, moved a Marxist analysis of [[commodity fetishism]] to the realm of consumption, and looked at the relation between consumerism and dominant ideology formation.

Another debate developed around the (distinct) criticisms of liberal political theory made by [[Michael Walzer]], [[Michael Sandel]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]. The [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[communitarian]] debate is often considered valuable for generating a new set of philosophical problems, rather than a profound and illuminating clash of perspective. These and other communitarians (such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] and [[Daniel A. Bell]]) argue that, contra liberalism, communities are prior to individuals and therefore should be the center of political focus. Communitarians tend to support greater local control as well as economic and social policies which encourage the growth of [[social capital]].

A prominent subject in recent political philosophy is the theory of [[deliberative democracy]]. The seminal work was done by Jurgen Habermas in Germany, but the most extensive literature has been in English, led by theorists such as [[Jane Mansbridge]], Joshua Cohen, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson, ''Democracy and Disagreement'' (Princeton University Press, 1996). Also see Gutmann and Thompson, ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' (Princeton University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

A pair of overlapping political perspectives arising toward the end of the 20th century are [[republicanism]] (or neo- or civic-republicanism) and the [[capability approach]]. The resurgent republican movement aims to provide an alternate definition of liberty from [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s positive and negative forms of liberty, namely "liberty as non-domination." Unlike the American liberal movement which understands liberty as "non-interference," "non-domination" entails individuals not being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person. To a republican the mere status as a slave, regardless of how that slave is treated, is objectionable. Prominent republicans include historian [[Quentin Skinner]], jurist [[Cass Sunstein]], and political philosopher [[Philip Pettit]]. The capability approach, pioneered by economists [[Mahbub ul Haq]] and [[Amartya Sen]] and further developed by legal scholar [[Martha Nussbaum]], understands freedom under allied lines: the real-world ability to act. Both the capability approach and republicanism treat choice as something which must be resourced. In other words, it is not enough to be legally able to do something, but to have the real option of doing it.

Another important strand of contemporary political theory in North America draws on thinkers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Gilles Deleuze]], among others, to develop critiques and articulate alternatives to the sufficiency of the [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[Communitarianism|communitarian]] debate and [[republicanism]] discourse. Since the 1990s, these political theorists, broadly engaging the "[[Genealogy (philosophy)|genealogical approach]]", "[[deconstruction]]", and [[Weak ontology (political concept)|"weak ontology]]", have expanded the scope of political theory and issued a variety of arguments on topics such as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], [[agonism]], [[Performativity|gender performativity]], secularism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Is Critique Secular?|last=Asad|first=Talal|last2=Brown|first2=Wendy|last3=Butler|first3=Judith|last4=Mahmood|first4=Saba|date=2013-05-09|publisher=Fordham University Press|isbn=9780823251681|doi = 10.5422/fordham/9780823251681.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Why I am not a secularist|last=Connolly, William E.|date=2010|publisher=Minnesota University Press|isbn=9780816633326|oclc=796203705}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and more recently the Anthropocene&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Facing the planetary.

== Influential political philosophers ==
A larger [[list of political philosophers]] is intended to be closer to exhaustive. Listed below are some of the most [[Archetype|canonical]] or important thinkers, and especially philosophers whose central focus was in political philosophy and/or who are good representatives of a particular school of thought.
* [[Thomas Aquinas]]: In synthesizing Christian theology and Peripatetic (Aristotelian) teaching in his ''[[Treatise on Law]]'', Aquinas contends that God's gift of higher reason—manifest in human law by way of the divine virtues—gives way to the assembly of righteous government.
* [[Aristotle]]: Wrote his ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' as an extension of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. Notable for the theories that humans are social animals, and that the [[polis]] (Ancient Greek city state) existed to bring about the good life appropriate to such animals. His political theory is based upon an ethics of [[perfectionism (philosophy)|perfectionism]] (as is [[Marx]]'s, on some readings).
* [[Mikhail Bakunin]]: After [[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], Bakunin became the most important political philosopher of [[anarchism]]. His specific version of anarchism is called [[collectivist anarchism]].
* [[Jeremy Bentham]]: The first thinker to analyze social justice in terms of maximization of aggregate individual benefits. Founded the philosophical/ethical school of thought known as [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Isaiah Berlin]]: Developed the distinction between positive and negative liberty.
* [[Edmund Burke]]: Irish member of the British parliament, Burke is credited with the creation of [[Conservatism|conservative]]  thought. Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' is the most popular of his writings where he denounced the French revolution. Burke was one of the biggest supporters of the American Revolution.
* [[Confucius]]: The first thinker to relate ethics to the political order.
* [[William E. Connolly]]: Helped introduce postmodern philosophy into political theory, and promoted new theories of [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralism]] and [[agonistic democracy]].
* [[John Dewey]]: Co-founder of [[pragmatism]] and analyzed the essential role of education in the maintenance of democratic government.
* [[Han Feizi]]: The major figure of the Chinese Fajia ([[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]) school, advocated government that adhered to laws and a strict method of administration.
* [[Michel Foucault]]: Critiqued the modern conception of power on the basis of the [[prison–industrial complex|prison complex]] and other prohibitive institutions, such as those that designate sexuality, madness and knowledge as the roots of their infrastructure, a critique that demonstrated that subjection is the power formation of subjects in any linguistic forum and that revolution cannot just be thought as the reversal of power between classes.
* [[Antonio Gramsci]]: Instigated the concept of ''[[hegemony]]''. Argued that the [[Sovereign state|state]] and the ruling class uses [[culture]] and [[ideology]] to gain the consent of the classes it rules over.
* [[Thomas Hill Green]]: Modern liberal thinker and early supporter of [[positive freedom]].
* [[Jürgen Habermas]]: Contemporary democratic theorist and sociologist. He has pioneered such concepts as the [[public sphere]], [[communicative action]], and [[deliberative democracy]]. His early work was heavily influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]].
* [[Friedrich Hayek]]: He argued that central planning was inefficient because members of central bodies could not know enough to match the preferences of consumers and workers with existing conditions. Hayek further argued that [[command economy|central economic planning]]—a mainstay of socialism—would lead to a "total" state with dangerous power. He advocated [[free-market]] capitalism in which the main role of the state is to maintain the [[rule of law]] and let spontaneous order develop.
* [[G. W. F. Hegel]]: Emphasized the "cunning" of history, arguing that it followed a rational trajectory, even while embodying seemingly irrational forces; influenced Marx, [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Michael Oakeshott|Oakeshott]].
* [[Thomas Hobbes]]: Generally considered to have first articulated how the concept of a [[social contract]] that justifies the actions of rulers (even where contrary to the individual desires of governed citizens), can be reconciled with a conception of sovereignty.
* [[David Hume]]: Hume criticized the social contract theory of John Locke and others as resting on a myth of some actual agreement. Hume was a realist in recognizing the role of force to forge the existence of states and that [[consent of the governed]] was merely hypothetical. He also introduced the concept of [[utility]], later picked up on and developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]]. Hume also coined the 'is/ought' problem i.e. the idea that just because something is does not mean that is how it ought to be. This was very influential on normative politics&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, A. (1959). Hume on "Is" and "Ought". The Philosophical Review, 68(4), 451–468. doi:10.2307/2182491&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Jefferson]]: Politician and political theorist during the [[American Enlightenment]]. Expanded on the philosophy of Thomas Paine by instrumenting [[republicanism]] in the United States. Most famous for the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].
* [[Immanuel Kant]]: Argued that participation in civil society is undertaken not for self-preservation, as per [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]], but as a moral duty. First modern thinker who fully analyzed structure and meaning of obligation. Argued that an international organization was needed to preserve world peace.
* [[Peter Kropotkin]]: One of the classic anarchist thinkers and the most influential theorist of [[anarcho-communism]].
* [[John Locke]]: Like Hobbes, described a social contract theory based on citizens' fundamental rights in the [[state of nature]]. He departed from Hobbes in that, based on the assumption of a society in which moral values are independent of governmental authority and widely shared, he argued for a government with power limited to the protection of personal property. His arguments may have been deeply influential to the formation of the [[United States Constitution]].
* [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]: First systematic analysis of how politics necessitates expedient and evil actions. Gave an account of statecraft in a realistic point of view instead of relying on idealism. Machiavelli also relays recommendations on how to run a well ordered [[Republicanism|republican]] state, as he viewed them to be better forms of government than autocracies.
* [[James Madison]]: American politician and protege of Jefferson considered to be "Father of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]" and "Father of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]" of the United States. As a political theorist, he believed in [[separation of powers]] and proposed a comprehensive set of [[Separation of powers#Checks and balances|checks and balances]] that are necessary to protect the rights of an individual from the [[tyranny of the majority]].
* [[Herbert Marcuse]]: Called the father of the [[new left]]. One of the principal thinkers within the [[Frankfurt School]], and generally important in efforts to fuse the thought of [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Introduced the concept of "[[repressive desublimation]]", in which social control can operate not only by direct control, but also by manipulation of desire. His work [[Eros and Civilization]] and notion of a non-repressive society was influential on the 1960s and its counter-cultural social movements.
* [[Karl Marx]]: In large part, added the historical dimension to an understanding of society, culture and economics. Created the concept of ''ideology'' in the sense of (true or false) beliefs that shape and control social actions. Analyzed the fundamental nature of class as a mechanism of governance and social interaction. Profoundly influenced world politics with his theory of communism.
* [[Mencius]]: One of the most important thinkers in the Confucian school, he is the first theorist to make a coherent argument for an obligation of rulers to the ruled.
* [[John Stuart Mill]]: A [[utilitarian]], and the person who named the system; he goes further than Bentham by laying the foundation for liberal democratic thought in general and modern, as opposed to classical, liberalism in particular. Articulated the place of individual liberty in an otherwise utilitarian framework.
* [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]]: Analyzed protection of the people by a "balance of powers" in the divisions of a state.
* [[John Rawls]]: Revitalized the study of normative political philosophy in Anglo-American universities with his 1971 book [[A Theory of Justice]], which uses a version of [[social contract theory]] to answer fundamental questions about [[justice]] and to criticise [[utilitarianism]].
* [[Mozi]]: Eponymous founder of the Mohist school, advocated a form of [[Mohist consequentialism|consequentialism]].
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]: Philosopher who became a powerful influence on a broad spectrum of 20th-century political currents in [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], [[socialism]], [[libertarianism]], and [[conservatism]]. His interpreters have debated the content of his political philosophy.
* [[Robert Nozick]]: Criticized Rawls, and argued for [[libertarianism]], by appeal to a hypothetical history of the [[State (polity)|state]] and of [[property]].
* [[Thomas Paine]]: [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] writer who defended [[liberal democracy]], the [[American Revolution]], and the [[French Revolution]] in ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' and The ''[[Rights of Man]]''.
* [[Plato]]: Wrote a lengthy dialog ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' in which he laid out his political philosophy: citizens should be divided into three categories. One category of people are the rulers: they should be philosophers, according to Plato, this idea is based on his [[Theory of Forms]].
* [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]: Commonly considered the father of modern [[anarchism]], specifically [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]].
* [[Ayn Rand]]: Founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] and prime mover of the Objectivist and Libertarian movements in mid-twentieth-century America. Advocated a complete, laissez-faire capitalism. Rand held that the proper role of government was exclusively the protection of individual rights without economic interference. The government was to be separated from economics the same way and for the same reasons it was separated from religion. Any governmental action not directed at the defense of individual rights would constitute the initiation of force (or threat of force), and therefore a violation not only of rights but also of the legitimate function of government.
* [[Murray Rothbard]]: The central theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]] and an [[Austrian School]] economist.
* [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: Analyzed the social contract as an expression of the [[general will]], and controversially argued in favor of absolute [[democracy]] where the people at large would act as [[Sovereignty|sovereign]].
* [[Carl Schmitt]]: German political theorist, tied to the Nazis, who developed the concepts of the Friend/Enemy Distinction and the State of exception. Though his most influential books were written in the 1920s, he continued to write prolifically until his death (in academic quasi-exile) in 1985. He heavily influenced 20th-century political philosophy both within the Frankfurt School and among others, not all of whom are philosophers, such as [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Hannah Arendt]], and [[Giorgio Agamben]].
* [[Adam Smith]]: Often said to have founded modern [[economics]]; explained emergence of economic benefits from the self-interested behavior ("the invisible hand") of artisans and traders. While praising its efficiency, Smith also expressed concern about the effects of industrial labor (e.g., repetitive activity) on workers. His work on moral sentiments sought to explain social bonds which enhance economic activity.
* [[Socrates]]: Widely considered the founder of Western political philosophy, via his spoken influence on Athenian contemporaries; since Socrates never wrote anything, much of what we know about him and his teachings comes through his most famous student, Plato.
* [[Baruch Spinoza]]: Set forth the first analysis of ''[[rational egoism]]'', in which the rational interest of self is conformance with pure reason. To Spinoza's thinking, in a society in which each individual is guided by reason, political authority would be superfluous.

He was also the founder of ethical egoism which endorses anarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Hospers, John (1973). Rule-Egoism. Pacific Philosophical Quarterly 54 (4):391.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Leo Strauss]]: Famously rejected modernity, mostly on the grounds of what he perceived to be modern political philosophy's excessive self-sufficiency of reason and flawed philosophical grounds for moral and political normativity. He argued instead we should return to pre-modern thinkers for answers to contemporary issues. His philosophy was influential on the formation of [[neoconservatism]], and a number of his students later were members of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]].

      <text bytes="7240" xml:space="preserve">'''Anti-incumbency''' is sentiment in favor of voting out [[incumbent politician]]s. It is sometimes referred to as a "throw the bums out" sentiment. Periods of anti-incumbent sentiment are typically characterized by [[wave election]]s.&lt;ref name=stanford/&gt; This sentiment can also lead to support for [[term limit]]s.

In a [[two-party system]], anti-incumbent voters have only one party to vote for, when voting against the incumbent; in a [[multi-party system]], [[public mood]], i.e., the tendency of opinions held by voters over a set of related policy issues, can determine which parties receive the anti-incumbent vote.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/baker/sites/default/files/attached-files/mexico_2012_paper_baker_website.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
When voters perceive times as bad, this can cause anti-incumbent sentiment. However, this is subject to biases. Perceptions of whether, e.g., economic conditions have worsened during a politician's term are influenced by [[partisan bias]], for instance.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.wilsonquarterly.com/sites/default/files/articles/WQ_VOL32_A_2008_Article_05_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., reliance on partisan media, as opposed to mainstream media, is associated with anti-incumbent attitudes toward Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Lee |first2=Angela M. |title=Kick the bums out?: A structural equation model exploring the degree to which mainstream and partisan sources influence polarization and anti-incumbent attitudes |journal=Electoral Studies |date=December 2015 |volume=40 |pages=210–220 |doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2015.08.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New democracies' elections, such as those in Central and Eastern Europe, and in Latin America and Asia, often are characterized by anti-incumbency.&lt;ref name=ecpr&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bochsler |first1=Daniel |last2=Hänni |first2=Miriam |title=The three stages of the anti-incumbency vote: Retrospective economic voting in young and established democracies |journal=European Journal of Political Research |date=February 2019 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=30–55 |doi=10.1111/1475-6765.12269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Bulgaria===
In Bulgaria, virtually every government has been ousted from power after one legislative period.&lt;ref name=ecpr/&gt;

===Bhutan===
The [[2018 Bhutan elections]] had an anti-incumbent result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/10/11/anti-incumbency-grips-bhutan |title = Anti-incumbency grips Bhutan|journal = The Economist|date = 2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
India has the highest rate of anti-incumbency in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/anti-incumbency-in-our-dna-1452422-2019-02-10 |title = Anti-incumbency in our DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt; with incumbents from the ruling party having only a fifty-fifty shot at returning to parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/08/13/incumbency-in-india-more-curse-than-blessing-pub-77010 |title = Incumbency in India: More Curse Than Blessing?}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, since 1985, the electorate in [[Assam, India]] has oscillated between voting the [[Asom Gana Parishad]] and the [[Indian National Congress]] to power.&lt;ref&gt;Counting on Anti-Incumbency Economic and Political Weekly, 24 March 2001, Vol.36(12), pp.981-981&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Karnataka]], the last time the ruling government was re-elected was in the 1985 Indian elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://thelogicalindian.com/tli-explains/anti-incumbency/ |title = TLI Explains: What is Anti-Incumbency &amp; How Does It Affect the Fate of Parties|date = 2019-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voter turnout]] does not appear correlated with incumbents' electoral performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vaishnav |first1=Milan |last2=Guy |first2=Johnathan |title=Does Higher Turnout Hurt Incumbents?

In 2018, India's period of anti-incumbency was accompanied by acute rural distress, multiple farmer agitations and serious joblessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.dailyo.in/politics/anti-incumbency-politics-madhya-pradesh-chhattisgarh-democracy-assembly-polls-2018/story/1/28468.html | title=Why the government should worry about the warning signs of anti-incumbency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
In the [[2010 Mexican gubernatorial elections]], incumbents from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]], and [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;An Anti-Incumbency Wave -- in Mexico. Krauze, Enrique The New York Times, July 7, 2010, p.A21(L)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Eras of anti-incumbent sentiment included the [[Gilded Age]], in which the majority party in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] shifted six times in the 15 Congressional elections between 1870 and 1900, with three of those shifts involving losses of more than 70 seats by the majority party. David M. Kennedy notes, "Generations of American scholars have struggled to find a coherent narrative or to identify heroic leaders in that era's messy and inconclusive political scene."&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=David M. |title=Throwing the Bums Out for 140 Years |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/opinion/07kennedy.html |work=The New York Times |date=6 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1992 United States elections]] were also characterized by anti-incumbent sentiment, as a stubborn recession and persistently high unemployment fuelled voter dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Myers |first1=Dee Dee |title=New Technology and the 1992 Clinton Presidential Campaign |journal=American Behavioral Scientist |date=27 July 2016 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=181–184 |doi=10.1177/0002764293037002003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 poll found that 60% of Americans would vote to "defeat and replace every single member of Congress, including [their] own representative" if that option were available.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.american.edu/cas/literature/wsp/upload/2016-atrium.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of anti-incumbency, at least with regard to U.S. elections, is controversial, since more often voters will punish only one party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.politico.com/story/2011/10/the-anti-incumbent-election-is-a-myth-065550 |title = The anti-incumbent election is a myth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three organizations that supported voting out incumbents were Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out, Vote Out Incumbents Democracy and Tenure Corrupts.

==Criticism==
A perceived disadvantage of anti-incumbency, with regard to judicial elections, is that good lawyers will not want to accept what they regard as a revolving-door judgeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Anti-incumbency's threat to judicial selection |journal=Judicature |date=1992 |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism of anti-incumbency is that it causes political parties to focus on single-term policies rather than long-term development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.gatewayhouse.in/the-quiet-decline-of-anti-incumbency/ |title = The quiet decline of anti-incumbency|date = 2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''inauguration''' is the process of swearing a person into [[Official|office]] and thus making that person the [[incumbent]]. Such an inauguration commonly occurs through a formal [[ceremony]] or special event.

The historical source of the word ''inauguration'' stems from the [[Latin]] ''[[augur]]'', which refers to the [[ritual]]s of ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Religion in ancient Rome#Public priesthoods and religious law|priests]] seeking to interpret if it was the will of the gods for a public official to be deemed worthy to assume [[Public Administration|office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/inaugurate|title=Oxford Dictionaries' Entry on ''Inauguration''|work=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public office==
{{see also|Presidential inauguration}}

The inaugurations of public figures, especially those of political leaders, often feature [[wikt:lavish|lavish]] ceremonies in which the figure publicly takes their [[oath of office]] (sometimes called "swearing in"), often in front of a large crowd of spectators. A [[monarchy|monarchical]] inauguration may take on different forms depending on the nation: they may undergo a [[coronation]] rite or may simply be required to take an oath in the presence of a country's legislature.

The "inaugural address" is a speech given during this ceremony which informs the people of their intentions as a leader. A famous inauguration speech is [[Inauguration of John F. Kennedy#The inaugural address|John F. Kennedy's]].

[[File:Kennedy Nixon debate New York 1960.jpg|thumb|Presidential debate between [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] for the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election in the United States]].]]
A '''leaders' debate''' or '''presidential debate''' is a [[public debate]] held during a [[general election]] campaign, where the candidates expose their [[political opinion]]s and [[public policy]] proposals, and criticism of them, to potential [[voter]]s. They are normally broadcast live on [[radio]], [[television]] and [[Internet]]. The events may be organized by media corporations or non-government organizations.

Leaders' debates are often popular with voters, whose decisions might be greatly influenced by the outcome.  Leaders have occasionally attempted to use [[Theatrical property|prop]]s (such as [[chart]]s or signs bearing [[slogan]]s) during a debate with varying degrees of success.

==History==
The success of early televised debates such as the 1960 [[American presidential debate]] between [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]], viewed by 70 million people,&lt;ref&gt;Lapsansky-Werner, Emma J. United States History: Modern America. Boston, MA: Pearson Learning Solutions, 2011. Print. Page 505&lt;/ref&gt;  would eventually spur the desire to hold similar, televised debates in countries under the [[parliamentary system]].  Television had quickly proven to be an excellent and efficient means of reaching out to large blocs of the electorate.  The unique aspect of the parliamentary system which creates the desire to hold leaders' debates is that the [[political party|party]] leader is usually the party's presumed candidate to lead the government, because by [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] he or she will usually become [[prime minister]] or [[premier]] if his or her party wins the most seats.  However, a leaders' debate is not technically a candidates debate in the same sense that an [[U.S. presidential election debates|American presidential debate]] would be, because in the latter case the American political parties have explicitly nominated the named individuals as their candidates for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].

==Format==
The exact format for a leaders' debate varies, but normally the debate will begin with each leader making a short opening statement.  Then a panel of well-known [[journalist]]s will ask sets of prepared questions, which are to be answered either by all of the leaders or by one specific leader.  After the leader(s) answer each question, the other leader(s) may get a chance to make a brief response, after which there may be some time allocated for an often heated "free for all" debate.  The [[Chairman|moderator]] will usually attempt to exercise some control through all of this, and then stop the debate after time has elapsed so the next question can be asked.  After the panelists finish asking questions, each leader will make his or her closing remarks and the debate will end.

Who gets invited to participate in a leaders' debate is often a sensitive issue.  Some jurisdictions may have dozens of fringe political parties which few networks would care to have participating in their debates.  For the sake of brevity, and to ensure the leaders of the main parties have adequate time to address voters on a wide range of issues, it is extremely rare for any leaders' debate to have more than five leaders.  A more common number would be three while Australia has two.  Leaders' debates are often restricted to parties which elected representatives in the previous election.  Exceptions may be made for parties with close to a full slate of candidates, but this is not always the case.  For example, in [[Canada]] in the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004]] and [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006]] the [[Green Party of Canada]] was excluded from the federal leaders' debates until [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008]] when public pressure on the other parties allowed the Green Party to join the debate, and the [[Alberta Alliance]] was excluded from the [[Alberta]]n provincial leaders debate, even though both parties had full slates in their respective elections.  Parties that are excluded will often complain bitterly about their exclusion, sometimes claiming that the political establishment has conspired in an effort to keep their party on the political fringe. The inclusion of certain parties in debates can be controversial too. A common complaint about the Canadian debates is voiced by a report from the [[Centre for the Study of Democracy]], which calls for the [[Bloc Québécois]], a party only active in mostly French-speaking Quebec, to be removed from its current position in the English-language debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://ottawacitizen.com/life/Blocking+Bloc/1994287/story.html | newspaper = [[The Ottawa Citizen]] | title = Blocking the Bloc | date= September 15, 2009 | accessdate = October 3, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], debates were often so heated that the debaters would be placed in separate rooms.&lt;ref name=StephenJones/&gt;

{{Elections}}
An '''election''' is a formal [[group decision-making]] process by which a population chooses an individual to hold [[Public administration|public office]].&lt;ref name = Brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/182308/election "Election (political science),"] Encyclopedia Britannica Online. Retrieved 18 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually used in Democratic nations.

Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern [[representative democracy]] has operated since the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Brit" /&gt; Elections may fill offices in the [[legislature]], sometimes in the [[executive (government)|executive]] and [[judiciary]], and for [[local government|regional and local government]]. This process is also used in many other private and [[business]] organizations, from clubs to [[voluntary association]]s and [[corporation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 438–446|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal|title-link = Robert's Rules of Order}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic [[archetype]], ancient [[History of Athens|Athens]], where the Elections were not used were considered an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] institution and most political offices were filled using [[sortition]], also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.&lt;ref&gt;Headlam, James Wycliffe (1891). Election by Lot at Athens. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electoral reform]] describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems. [[Psephology]] is the study of results and other [[statistics]] relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).

To ''elect'' means "to select or make a decision", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as [[referendum]]s are referred to as elections, especially in the United States.

Elections were used as early in history as [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], and throughout the Medieval period to select rulers such as the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (see [[imperial election]]) and the [[pope]] (see [[papal election]]).&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt;

In [[Vedic period]] of India, the ''[[Raja]]'' (chiefs) of a ''[[gana]]'' (a tribal organization) was apparently elected by the ''gana''. The ''Raja'' belonged to the noble [[Kshatriya]] [[varna in Hinduism|varna]] (warrior class), and was typically a son of the previous R''aja''. However, the ''gana'' members had the final say in his elections.&lt;ref name="Robinson1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=Eric W.

The modern "election", which consists of public elections of government officials, didn't emerge until the beginning of the 17th century when the idea of [[representative government]] took hold in North America and Europe.&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt;

Questions of [[suffrage]], especially suffrage for minority groups, have dominated the history of elections. Males, the dominant cultural group in North America and Europe, often dominated the [[:wikt:electorate|electorate]] and continue to do so in many countries.&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt; Early elections in countries such as the [[Elections in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and [[Elections in the United States|the United States]] were dominated by [[landed gentry|landed]] or [[ruling class]] males.&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt; However, by 1920 all Western European and North American democracies had universal adult male suffrage (except Switzerland) and many countries began to consider [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt; Despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males, political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections (see [[civil rights movement]]).&lt;ref name = Brit/&gt;

==Characteristic==

===Suffrage===
The question of who may vote is a central issue in elections. The electorate does not generally include the entire population; for example, many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting, all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting.

In Australia, Aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 (see [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum entry]]) and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners serving for 3 years or more to vote (a large proportion of which were Aboriginal Australians).

Suffrage is typically only for citizens of the country, though further limits may be imposed.

However, in the European Union, one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an EU citizen; the nationality of the country of residence is not required. 
[[File:ElezioneMilano.jpg|thumb|right|Campaigners working on posters in [[Milan]], Italy, 2004]]
In some countries, voting is required by law; if an eligible voter does not cast a vote, he or she may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine. In Western Australia, the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a $20.00 fine, which increases to $50.00 if the offender refused to vote prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.elections.wa.gov.au/vote/failure-vote|title=Failure to Vote {{!}} Western Australian Electoral Commission|website=www.elections.wa.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomination of candidate===
A [[representative democracy]] requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office. In many cases, nomination for office is mediated through [[preselection]] processes in organized political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Reuven Hazan, 'Candidate Selection', in Lawrence LeDuc, Richard Niemi and Pippa Norris (eds), ''Comparing Democracies 2'', Sage Publications, London, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-partisan systems tend to be different from partisan systems as concerns nominations. In a [[direct democracy]], one type of [[non-partisan democracy]], any eligible person can be nominated. Although elections were used in ancient Athens, in Rome, and in the selection of popes and Holy Roman emperors, the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in Europe and North America beginning in the 17th century. In some systems no nominations take place at all, with voters free to choose any person at the time of voting—with some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirement—in the jurisdiction. In such cases, it is not required (or even possible) that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons, though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some first-hand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels (i.e., among the elected delegates).

As far as partisan systems, in some countries, only members of a particular party can be nominated (see [[one-party state]]).  Or, any eligible person can be nominated through a process; thus allowing him or her to be listed.

===Electoral systems===
Electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and [[voting system]]s that convert the vote into a political decision. The first step is to tally the votes, for which various [[vote counting systems]] and [[ballot]] types are used. Voting systems then determine the result on the basis of the tally. Most systems can be categorized as either [[Proportional representation|proportional]] or [[majoritarian]].  Among the former are [[party-list proportional representation]] and [[additional member system]].  Among the latter are [[First Past the Post electoral system]] (relative majority) and [[absolute majority]].  Many countries have growing electoral reform movements, which advocate systems such as [[approval voting]], [[single transferable vote]], [[Instant-runoff voting|instant runoff voting]] or a [[Condorcet method]]; these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods.

While openness and [[accountability]] are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system, the act of casting a vote and the content of a voter's ballot are usually an important exception.  The [[secret ballot]] is a relatively modern development, but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections, as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation.

===Scheduling===
The nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people, and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] to continue in office. For that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals. In the United States, elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level, with exceptions for elected judicial positions that may have longer terms of office. There is a variety of schedules, for example presidents: the [[President of Ireland]] is elected every seven years, the [[President of Russia]] and the [[President of Finland]] every six years, the [[President of France]] every five years, [[President of the United States]] every four years.

Pre-decided or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability. However, they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns, and make [[dissolution of parliament|dissolving the legislature]] (parliamentary system) more problematic if the date should happen to fall at time when dissolution is inconvenient (e.g. when war breaks out). Other states (e.g., the [[United Kingdom]]) only set maximum time in office, and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls. In practice, this means the government remains in power for close to its full term, and choose an election date it calculates to be in its best interests (unless something special happens, such as a [[motion of no-confidence]]). This calculation depends on a number of variables, such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority.

===Election campaigns===
{{main|Political campaign}}
When elections are called, politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns.  Supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated, and frequently utilize [[campaign advertising]]. It is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via [[Political Forecasting]] methods.

The most expensive election campaign included US$7 billion spent on the [[2012 United States presidential election]] and is followed by the US$5 billion spent on the [[2014 Indian general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Difficulties with elections===
[[File:The Presidential Election in Argentina, the Polling-Station at the Church of La Merced, Buenos Ayres.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Buenos Aires]] 1892 "The rival voters were kept back by an armed force of police out of sight to others. Only batches of two or three were allowed to enter the polling-office at a time. Armed sentries guarded the gates and the doors." ([[Godefroy Durand]], ''[[The Graphic]]'', [[21 May]] [[1892]]).]]
{{main|Electoral fraud|Unfair election}}
{{see also|Electoral integrity|Foreign electoral intervention}}

In many of the countries with weak [[rule of law]], the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being "free and fair" is interference from the incumbent government. [[Dictator]]s may use the powers of the executive (police, martial law, censorship, physical implementation of the election mechanism, etc.) to remain in power despite popular opinion in favor of removal. Members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority (passing criminal laws, defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries) to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election.&lt;ref name="Brit" /&gt;

Non-governmental entities can also interfere with elections, through physical force, verbal intimidation, or fraud, which can result in improper casting or counting of votes. Monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections. Problems that prevent an election from being "free and fair" take various forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free and Fair Elections|url=http://www.publicsphereproject.org/content/free-and-fair-elections|website=Public Sphere Project|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lack of open political debate or an informed electorate====
The electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of [[freedom of the press]], lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control, and/or lack of access to news and political media. [[Freedom of speech]] may be curtailed by the state, favoring certain viewpoints or state [[propaganda]].

====Unfair rules====

[[Gerrymandering]], exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office, needlessly high restrictions on who may be a candidate, like [[ballot access]] rules, and manipulating thresholds for electoral success are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favor a specific faction or candidate.

====Interference with campaigns====
{{see also|Foreign electoral intervention}}
Those in power may arrest or assassinate candidates, suppress or even criminalize campaigning, close campaign headquarters, harass or beat campaign workers, or intimidate voters with violence. [[Foreign electoral intervention]] can also occur, with the United States interfering betweem 1946 and 2000 in 81 elections and [[Russia]]/[[USSR]] in 36.&lt;ref name="LevinISQ2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Dov H.|url=http://isq.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/2/189|title=When the Great Power Gets a Vote: The Effects of Great Power Electoral Interventions on Election Results|journal=[[International Studies Quarterly]]|volume=60|issue=2|date=June 2016|pp=189–202|doi=10.1093/isq/sqv016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2018 the most intense interventions, by means of false information, were by [[China]] in [[Taiwan]] and by [[Russia]] in [[Latvia]]; the next highest levels were in Bahrain, Qatar and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |url=https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/99/de/99dedd73-f8bc-484c-8b91-44ba601b6e6b/v-dem_democracy_report_2019.pdf |title=Democracy Facing Global Challenges, V-DEM ANNUAL DEMOCRACY REPORT 2019, p.36 |date=2019-05-14 |access-date=2020-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tampering with the election mechanism====
{{see also|Election audit|Certification of voting machines |Secret ballot|Voter impersonation |Voter ID laws|Voter suppression}}

This can include falsifying voter instructions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sanmateocourt.org/documents/grand_jury/2018/elections.pdf|title=Security of Election Announcements|last=2018-2019 San Mateo County Civil Grand Jury|date=July 24, 2019|publisher=Superior Court of California|access-date=August 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[voter suppression]], voter registration fraud, failure to validate voter residency, fraudulent tabulation of results, and use of physical force or verbal intimation at polling places. Other examples include persuading candidates not to run, such as through blackmailing, bribery, intimidation or physical violence.

== Show election ==
{{Anchor|Sham election}}
A '''sham election''', or '''show election''', is an election that is held purely for show; that is, without any significant political choice or real impact on results of election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/s/sham-election/|title=Sham Election Law and Legal Definition {{!}} USLegal, Inc.|last=Inc.|first=US Legal|website=definitions.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Show elections are a common event in [[Dictatorship|dictatorial regimes]] that feel the need to feign the appearance of public [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]]. Published results usually show nearly 100% [[voter turnout]] and high support (typically at least 80%, and close to 100% in many cases) for the prescribed candidate(s) or for the [[referendum]] choice that favors the [[political party]] in power. Dictatorial regimes can also organize show elections with results simulating those that might be achieved in democratic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kim-jong-un-wins-100-of-the-vote-in-north-korean-elections-9180814.html | title=Kim Jong-un wins 100% of the vote in his constituency| date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, only one government approved candidate is allowed to run in sham elections with no opposition candidates allowed, or opposition candidates are arrested on false charges (or even without any charges) before the election to prevent them from running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/02/21/world/meast/yemen-elections/index.html|title=Yemen holds presidential election with one candidate|first=Mohammed |last=Jamjoom|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/29/egyptian-opposition-calls-boycott-elections-challengers-arrested/|title=Egyptian opposition calls for boycott of elections after challengers are arrested and attacked|first1=Raf|last1=Sanchez|first2=Magdy|last2=Samaan|date=29 January 2018|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlAlexei Navalny latest: Russian opposition leader arrested ahead of presidential election | The Independent"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/alexei-navalny-latest-updates-russia-president-election-opposition-leader-putin-protests-a8222956.html |title=Alexei Navalny latest: Russian opposition leader arrested ahead of presidential election &amp;#124; The Independent |website= |accessdate=|date=22 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballots may contain only one "yes" option, or in the case of a simple "yes or no" question, security forces often [[Persecution|persecute]] people who pick "no", thus encouraging them to pick the "yes" option. In other cases, those who vote receive stamps in their passport for doing so, while those who did not vote (and thus do not receive stamps) are persecuted as [[Enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764407,00.html|title=RUSSIA: Justice in The Baltic|date=1940-08-19|work=Time|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlYes, There Are Elections in North Korea and Heres How They Work - The Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/03/north-korea-elections-guide/358875/ |title=Yes, There Are Elections in North Korea and Here's How They Work - The Atlantic |format= |website= |accessdate=|date=6 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, show elections can backfire against the party in power, especially if the regime believes they are popular enough to win without coercion or fraud. The most famous example of this was the [[1990 Myanmar general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/05/26/burma-20-years-after-1990-elections-democracy-still-denied|title=Burma: 20 Years After 1990 Elections, Democracy Still Denied|date=2010-05-26|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2018-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples===

[[File:Stimmzettel-Anschluss.jpg|thumb|right|A ballot from the [[1938 German parliamentary election and referendum|1938 elections in Nazi Germany]] asking voters to approve the new [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] and the [[Anschluss]]. The "no" box was made significantly smaller than the "yes" box.]]

Examples of sham elections are the [[1929 Italian general election|1929]] and [[1934 Italian general election|1934]] [[Elections in Italy|elections]] in [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]], [[Elections in Nazi Germany|elections]] in [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Occupation of the Baltic States|1940 elections]] of the [[People's Parliament]]s in [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]] and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]], the [[1955 State of Vietnam referendum|1955 referendum in Vietnam]], the [[1958 Portuguese presidential election|1958 election]] in Portugal, the [[2014 Crimean status referendum|2014 Crimean referendum]], and in most [[Communist state|communist]] and [[socialist state|socalist]] states (e.g. [[Elections in East Germany|East Germany]], [[Elections in the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union]], [[Elections in China|China]], [[Elections in North Korea|North Korea]], [[Ba'athist Iraq]]).

A predetermined conclusion is always established by the regime through [[Political repression|suppression]] of the opposition, [[coercion]] of voters, [[Electoral fraud|vote rigging]], reporting a number of votes received greater than the number of voters, outright lying, or some combination of these.

In an extreme example, [[Charles D. B. King]] of [[Liberia]] was reported to have won by 234,000 votes in the [[1927 Liberian general election|1927 general election]], a "majority" that was over fifteen times larger than the number of eligible voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberiapastandpresent.org/1927ElectionsMF.htm|title=Liberia past and present 1927 elections|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''referendum''' (plural: '''referendums''' or less commonly '''referenda''') is a [[Direct democracy|direct]] and [[Universal suffrage|universal]] [[vote]] in which an entire [[Constituency|electorate]] is invited to vote on a particular proposal and can have nationwide or [[Electoral district|local]] forms. This may result in the adoption of a new [[policy]] or specific [[law]]. In some countries, it is synonymous with a '''plebiscite''' or a vote on a '''ballot question'''.

Some definitions of 'plebiscite' suggest it is a type of vote to change the constitution or government of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/plebiscite |title=Definition of Plebiscite |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word, 'referendum' is often a catchall, used for both [[legislative referral]]s and [[initiative]]s. Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution and 'plebiscite' as a vote which does not affect the constitution.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2015/08/plebiscite-or-referendum-whats-the-difference.html | title=Plebiscite or Referendum - What's the Difference | publisher=ABC | date=12 August 2015 | accessdate=23 August 2015 | author=Green, Antony}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Ireland, 'plebiscite' referred to the vote to adopt its constitution,  but a subsequent vote to amend the constitution is called a 'referendum', as is a poll of the electorate on a non-constitutional bill.

==Etymology and plural form==
'Referendum' is the [[gerundive]] form of the [[Latin language|Latin]] verb ''refero'', literally "to carry back" (from the verb ''fero'', "to bear, bring, carry"&lt;ref&gt;Marchant &amp; Charles, Cassell's Latin Dictionary, 1928, p.221&lt;/ref&gt; plus the inseparable [[prefix]] ''re-'', here meaning "back"&lt;ref&gt;Marchant &amp; Charles, Cassell's Latin Dictionary, 1928, p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt;). As a gerundive is an [[adjective]],&lt;ref&gt;A gerundive is a verbal adjective (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.)&lt;/ref&gt; not a [[noun]],&lt;ref&gt;A [[gerund]]  is a verbal noun (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) but has no nominative case, for which an infinitive (''referre'') serves the purpose&lt;/ref&gt; it cannot be used alone in Latin, and must be contained within a  context attached to a noun such as ''Propositum quod referendum est populo'', "A proposal which must be carried back to the people". The addition of the verb ''sum'' (3rd person singular, ''est'') to a gerundive, denotes the idea of necessity or compulsion, that which "must" be done, rather than that which is "fit for" doing. Its use as a noun in English is not considered a strictly grammatical usage of a foreign word, but is rather a freshly coined English noun, which follows English grammatical usage, not Latin grammatical usage. This determines the form of the plural in English, which according to English grammar should be "referendums". The use of "referenda" as a plural form in English (treating it as a Latin word and attempting to apply to it the rules of Latin grammar) is unsupportable according to the rules of both Latin and English grammar. The use of "referenda" as a plural form is  posited hypothetically as either a gerund or a gerundive by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which rules out such usage in both cases as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Referendum&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Referendums'' is logically preferable as a plural form meaning 'ballots on one issue' (as a Latin gerund,&lt;ref&gt;a [[gerund]] is a verbal noun (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, p. 91.) but has no nominative case, for which an infinitive (''referre'') serves the purpose. It has only accusative, genitive, dative and ablative cases (Kennedy's Shorter Latin Primer, 1962 edition, pp. 91-2.)&lt;/ref&gt; referendum has no plural). The Latin plural gerundive 'referenda', meaning 'things to be referred', necessarily connotes a plurality of issues.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. ''Proposita quae referenda sunt popolo'', "Proposals which must be carried back to the people"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is closely related to [[political agenda|agenda]], "those matters which must be driven forward", from ''ago'', to drive (cattle); and [[memorandum]], "that matter which must be remembered", from ''memoro'', to call to mind, [[corrigenda]], from ''rego'', to rule, make straight, those things which must be made straight (corrected), etc.

==Earliest use ==
The name and use of the 'referendum' is thought to have originated in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] canton of [[Graubünden]] as early as the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Benjamin R.. ''The Death of Communal Liberty: A History of Freedom in a Swiss Mountain Canton''. Princeton University Press, 1974, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent, J.M.. ''State and Federal Government in Switzerland'', Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;122&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'plebiscite' has a generally similar meaning in modern usage, and comes from the Latin ''plebiscita'', which originally meant a decree of the ''[[Plebeian Council|Concilium Plebis]]'' (Plebeian Council), the popular assembly of the [[Roman Republic]]. Today, a referendum can also often be referred to as a plebiscite, but in some countries the two terms are used differently to refer to votes with differing types of legal consequences. For example,  Australia defines 'referendum' as a vote to change the constitution, and 'plebiscite' as a vote that does not affect the constitution.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; In contrast, Ireland has only ever held one plebiscite, which was the vote to adopt its constitution, and every other vote has been called a referendum. Plebiscite has also been used to denote a non-binding vote count such as the one held by Nazi Germany to 'approve' in retrospect the so-called Anschluss with Austria, the question being not 'Do you permit?' but rather 'Do you approve?' of that which has most definitely already occurred.

==Typology==
The term referendum covers a variety of different meanings. A referendum can be binding or advisory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=2–3 |title=The Dynamics of Referendum Campaigns: An International Perspective|chapter=Context, Elites, Media and Public Opinion in Reerendums: When Campaigns Really Matter|last= de Vreese |first=Claes H. |isbn=9780230591189 |chapter-url=https://books.google.de/books?id=wHuGDAAAQBAJ |date= 2007 |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, different names are used for these two types of referendum.

Referendums can be further classified by who initiates them: mandatory referendums prescribed by law, voluntary referendums initiated by the legislature or government, and referendums initiated by citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serdült|first1=Uwe|last2=Welp|first2=Yanina|title=Direct Democracy Upside Down|journal=Taiwan Journal of Democracy| date=2012 |volume=8 |issue=1 |url=http://www.tfd.org.tw/export/sites/tfd/files/publication/journal/dj0801/004.pdf|doi=10.5167/uzh-98412|pages=69–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[deliberative referendum]] is a referendum specifically designed to improve the deliberative qualities of the campaign preceding the referendum vote, and/or of the act of voting itself.

==Rationale==
From a political-philosophical perspective, referendums are an expression of [[direct democracy]], but today, most referendums need to be understood within the context of representative democracy. They tend to be used quite selectively, covering issues such as changes in voting systems, where currently elected officials may not have the legitimacy or inclination to implement such changes.

==Referendums by country==
{{Further|Referendums by country}}
Since the end of the 18th century, hundreds of national referendums have been organised in the world;&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|fr}} Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, ''Le bonheur. L'approche économique'', [[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]], 2013 ({{ISBN|978-2-88915-010-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; almost 600 national votes were held in [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]] since its inauguration as a [[Modern history of Switzerland|modern state in 1848]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/explore-600-national-votes_how-direct-democracy-has-grown-over-the-decades/41481992 |title=How direct democracy has grown over the decades |author=Duc-Quang Nguyen |publisher=swissinfo.ch - a branch of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR |date=17 June 2015  |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy]] ranked second with 72 [[Referendums in Italy|national referendums]]: 67 popular referendums (46 of which were proposed by the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]]), 3 constitutional referendums, [[1946 Italian institutional referendum|one institutional referendum]] and [[1989 Italian advisory referendum|one advisory referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://elezionistorico.interno.it/index.php?tpel=F |title = Dipartimento per gli Affari Interni e Territoriali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Mutiplechoice}}&lt;!--[[Preferendum]] and [[Multiple-choice referendum]] redirect here--&gt;Multiple-choice referendums==
{{seealsocat|Multiple-choice referendums}}
A referendum usually offers the electorate a choice of accepting or rejecting a proposal, but not always. Some referendums give voters the choice among multiple choices and some use transferable voting.

In [[Switzerland]], for example, multiple choice referendums are common. Two multiple choice referendums were held in [[Sweden]], in 1957 and in 1980, in which voters were offered three options. In 1977, a referendum held in [[Australia]] to determine a new [[Advance Australia Fair|national anthem]] was held in which voters had four choices. In 1992, New Zealand held a five-option referendum on their electoral system. In 1982, Guam had referendum that used six options, with an additional blank option for those wishing to (campaign and) vote for their own seventh option.

A multiple choice referendum poses the question of how the result is to be determined. They may be set up so that if no single option receives the support of an absolute [[majority]] (more than half) of the votes, resort can be made to the two-round system or [[instant-runoff voting]], which is also called IRV and PV.

In 2018 the Irish [[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|Citizens' Assembly]] considered the conduct of future [[referendums in Ireland]], with 76 of the members in favour of allowing more than two options, and 52% favouring preferential voting in such cases.&lt;ref name="citizensassembly_referenda"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/Manner-in-which-referenda-are-held/Manner-in-which-referenda-are-held.html|title=Manner in which referenda are held|publisher=Citizens' Assembly|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other people regard a non-majoritarian methodology like the [[Modified Borda Count]] (MBC) as more inclusive and more accurate.

Swiss referendums offer a separate vote on each of the multiple options as well as an additional decision about which of the multiple options should be preferred. In the Swedish case, in both referendums the 'winning' option was chosen by the [[First Past the Post electoral system|Single Member Plurality]] ("first past the post") system. In other words, the winning option was deemed to be that supported by a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]], rather than an absolute majority, of voters. In the 1977, Australian referendum, the winner was chosen by the system of preferential [[instant-runoff voting]] (IRV). Polls in Newfoundland (1949) and Guam (1982), for example, were counted under a form of the [[two-round system]], and an unusual form of TRS was used in the 1992 New Zealand poll.

Although [[California]] has not held multiple-choice referendums in the Swiss or Swedish sense (in which only one of several counter-propositions can be victorious, and the losing proposals are wholly null and void), it does have so many yes-or-no referendums at each Election Day that conflicts arise. The State's Constitution provides a method for resolving conflicts when two or more inconsistent propositions are passed on the same day. This is a de facto form of [[approval voting]]—i.e. the proposition with the most "yes" votes prevails over the others to the extent of any conflict.

Another voting system that could be used in multiple-choice referendum is the [[Condorcet method|Condorcet rule]].

==Criticisms==

===Criticism of populist aspect===
[[File:Odessa Russian Sring 20140330 07.JPG|thumb|Pro-Russian protesters in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]], demanding a referendum, March 30, 2014]]
[[File:20150703 Greek Referendum Demonstration for NO syntagma square Athens Greece.jpg|thumb| [[2015 Greek bailout referendum]] Demonstration for "NO" vote [[Syntagma square]] [[Athens]], [[Greece]] ]]

Critics{{who|date=February 2016}} of the referendum argue that voters in a referendum are more likely to be driven by transient whims than by careful deliberation, or that they are not sufficiently informed to make decisions on complicated or technical issues. Also, voters might be swayed by [[propaganda]], strong personalities, intimidation, and expensive advertising campaigns. [[James Madison]] argued that direct democracy is the "[[tyranny of the majority]]".

Some opposition to the referendum has arisen from its use by dictators such as [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] who, it is argued,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Qvortrup|first1=Matt |title=Direct Democracy: A Comparative Study of the Theory and Practice of Government by the People|isbn=978-0-7190-8206-1|date=2013|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the plebiscite to disguise oppressive policies as [[populism]]. Dictators may also make use of referendums as well as [[show elections]] to further legitimize their authority such as Benito Mussolini in [[1934 Italian general election|1934]], Adolf Hitler in [[1936 German election and referendum|1936]], [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in [[1973 Philippine constitutional plebiscite|1973]], [[Park Chung-hee]] in [[1972 South Korean constitutional referendum|1972]], and [[Francisco Franco]] in [[1947 Spanish law of succession referendum|1947]]. Hitler's use of plebiscites is argued{{by whom|date=March 2016}} as the reason why, since [[World War II]], there has been no provision in [[Germany]] for the holding of referendums at the federal level.

In recent years, referendums have been used strategically by several European governments trying to pursue political and electoral goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jcer.net/index.php/jcer/article/view/836/781|first1= Cecilia Emma |last1=Sottilotta|date= 2017|title=The Strategic Use of Government-Sponsored Referendums in Contemporary Europe: Issues and Implications|journal= Journal of Contemporary European Research|volume=13|issue=4|pages=1361–1376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, [[Bruton]] considered that {{quote|All governments are unpopular. Given the chance, people would vote against them in a referendum. Therefore avoid referendums. Therefore don’t raise questions which require them, such as the big versus the little states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/31/referendums-are-a-bad-idea-irish-leader-told-eu-in-1995 |title = Referendums are a bad idea, Irish leader told EU in 1995|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 2019-12-31|last1 = Bowcott|first1 = Owen|last2 = Davies|first2 = Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt;.}}

===Closed questions and the separability problem===
Some critics of the referendum attack the use of closed questions. A difficulty called the [[separability problem]] can plague a referendum on two or more issues. If one issue is in fact, or in perception, related to another on the ballot, the imposed simultaneous voting of first preference on each issue can result in an outcome which is displeasing to most.

===Undue limitations on regular government power===
Several commentators have noted that the use of [[initiative|citizens' initiatives]] to amend constitutions has so tied the government to a jumble of popular demands as to render the government unworkable. A 2009 article in ''[[The Economist]]'' argued that this had restricted the ability of the [[California]] state government to tax the people and pass the budget, and called for an entirely new Californian constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar problem also arises when elected governments accumulate excessive debts. That can severely reduce the effective margin for later governments.

Both these problems can be moderated by a combination of other measures as 
* strict rules for correct accounting on budget plans and effective public expenditure;
* mandatory assessment by an independent public institution of all budgetary implications of all legislative proposals, before they can be approved;
* mandatory prior assessment of the constitutional coherence of any proposal;
* interdiction of extra-budget expenditure (tax payers anyway have to fund them, sooner or later).

A '''diplomatic mission''' or '''foreign mission'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/ofm/property/fmc/c53113.htm |title=What is a Foreign Mission /Chancery? |website=www.state.gov |language=en-PH |access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of people from one [[Sovereign state|state]] or an organisation present in another state to represent the sending state/organisation officially in the receiving state. In practice, the phrase ''[[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] mission'' usually denotes the resident mission, namely the '''embassy''', which is the main office of a country's diplomatic representatives to another country; this is usually, but not necessarily, in the receiving state's [[Capital (political)|capital]] city. [[Consulates]], on the other hand, are smaller diplomatic missions which are normally located in major cities of the receiving state (but can be located in the capital, usually when the sending country has no embassy in the receiving state). As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries. There are thus resident and non-resident embassies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TdSOAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&amp;dq=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BIlvTbTLGIeZhQeHgIlQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgo Tom Nierop, ''Systems and Regions in Global Politics''] (Wiley, John and Sons 1994 {{ISBN|978-0-471-94942-8}}), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Russian Federation has diplomatic relations with a total of 187 countries, but some of them – mainly for financial reasons – maintain non-resident embassies in other countries", [https://books.google.com/books?id=87e5AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&amp;dq=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zrNuTaCUKMiHhQe6kOk-&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTge ''International Affairs''], issues 4–6 (Znanye Pub.

==Terminology==
A country may have several different types of diplomatic missions in another country.

An '''embassy''' is a diplomatic mission generally located in the capital city of another country which offers a full range of services, including consular services.

A '''high commission''' is an embassy of a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country located in another Commonwealth country.

A '''permanent mission''' is a diplomatic mission to a major international organization.

A '''consulate general''' is a diplomatic mission located in a major city, usually other than the capital city, which provides a full range of consular services.

A '''consulate''' is a diplomatic mission that is similar to a consulate general, but may not provide a full range of services.

A '''consulate headed by an Honorary Consul''' is a diplomatic mission headed by an Honorary Consul which provides only a limited range of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ediplomat.com/nd/mission_types.htm|title = Types of Diplomatic Missions|website = e Diplomat|date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of an embassy is known as an [[ambassador]] or [[high commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissioner]]. The term ''embassy'' is commonly used also as a section of a building in which the work of the diplomatic mission is carried out, but, strictly speaking, it is the diplomatic delegation itself that is the embassy, while the office space and the diplomatic work done is called the ''[[chancery (diplomacy)|chancery]]''. Therefore, the embassy operates in the chancery.

The members of a diplomatic mission can reside within or outside the building that holds the mission's chancery, and their private residences enjoy the same rights as the premises of the mission as regards inviolability and protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf |title=1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, article 30 |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All missions to the [[United Nations]] are known simply as ''permanent missions'', while [[EU member states]]' missions to the [[European Union]] are known as ''permanent representations'', and the head of such a mission is typically both a permanent representative and an ambassador. European Union missions abroad are known as EU delegations. Some countries have more particular naming for their missions and staff: a [[Holy See|Vatican]] mission is headed by a [[nuncio]] ([[Latin]] for "envoy") and consequently known as an ''[[apostolic nunciature]]''. Under the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Foreign relations of Libya|Libya's missions]] used the name ''people's bureau'', headed by a secretary.

Missions between [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries are known as ''high commissions'', and their heads are high commissioners.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrRdc5SI_R4C&amp;pg=PT50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=33 |title=Introduction To Tourism And Hospitality Industry |author=Sidhur Andrews |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education |date=1 Jun 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, ambassadors and high commissioners are regarded as equivalent in status and function, and embassies and high commissions are both deemed to be diplomatic missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/diplomatic-and-consular-representations/ |title=Diplomatic and Consular Representations |first=Jim S. |last=Nutt |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpahq.org/cpahq/cpadocs/cpa%20address%20140311.pdf|title=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, "What does the work of a High Commissioner involve?" |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, a diplomatic mission headed by a lower-ranking official (an ''envoy'' or ''minister resident'') was known as a ''[[legation]]''. Since the ranks of envoy and minister resident are effectively obsolete, the designation of ''legation'' is no longer used today. (See [[diplomatic rank]].)

A [[Consul (representative)|consulate]] is similar to, but not the same as a diplomatic office, but with focus on dealing with individual persons and businesses, as defined by the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]]. A consulate or consulate general is generally a representative of the embassy in locales outside of the capital city.&lt;ref name=name/&gt; For instance, the Philippines  has its [[Embassy of the Philippines in Washington, D.C.]], but also maintains seven consulates-general and four consulates elsewhere in the US. The person in charge of a consulate or consulate-general is known as a consul or consul-general, respectively. Similar services may also be provided at the embassy (to serve the region of the capital) in what is normally called a consular section.

In cases of dispute, it is common for a country to [[Letter of credence|recall]] its head of mission as a sign of its displeasure. This is less drastic than cutting diplomatic relations completely, and the mission will still continue operating more or less normally, but it will now be headed by a ''[[chargé d'affaires]]'' (usually the [[deputy chief of mission]]) who may have limited powers. A ''chargé d'affaires ad interim'' also heads the mission during the interim between the end of one chief of mission's term and the beginning of another.

==Extraterritoriality==
[[File:Diplomatic Corps seal - Corps Diplomatique emblem logo.png|thumb|upright=0.45|right|Seal of a [[diplomatic corps]]]]
Contrary to popular belief, most diplomatic missions do not enjoy full [[extraterritorial status]] and – in those cases – are not sovereign territory of the represented state.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/miscellaneous/laws-and-rules-regarding-extraterritoriality/ Laws and Rules Regarding Extraterritoriality]' on integrity-legal.com: "There is a common misconception that Embassies and Consulates have extraterritoriality. As anecdotal evidence of this misconception, people will often say things like, 'the US Embassy sits upon United States soil.' For the most part, this is not the case as extraterritoriality is not conferred upon an Embassy or Consulate, but in some situations extraterritoriality may be created by Treaty".&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the premises of diplomatic missions usually{{examples needed|date=August 2019}} remain under the jurisdiction of the host state while being afforded special privileges (such as immunity from most local laws) by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]]. Diplomats themselves still retain full [[diplomatic immunity]], and (as an adherent to the Vienna Convention) the host country may not enter the premises of the mission without permission of the represented country, even to put out a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diplomacy.state.gov/discoverdiplomacy/diplomacy101/places/170537.htm |title=What is a U.S. Embassy? |website=diplomacy.state.gov |access-date=2014-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510232505/https://diplomacy.state.gov/discoverdiplomacy/diplomacy101/places/170537.htm |archive-date=2018-05-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; International rules designate an attack on an embassy as an attack on the country it represents.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The term "extraterritoriality" is often applied to diplomatic missions, but normally only in this broader sense.

As the host country may not enter the representing country's embassy without permission, embassies are sometimes used by [[refugee]]s escaping from either the host country or a third country. For example, [[North Korea]]n nationals, who would be arrested and deported from China upon discovery, have sought sanctuary at various third-country embassies in China. Once inside the embassy, diplomatic channels can be used to solve the issue and send the refugees to another country. See the [[list of people who took refuge in a diplomatic mission]] for a list of some notable cases.

Notable violations of embassy extraterritoriality include repeated invasions of the British Embassy, Beijing (1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |date=15 August 2012 |title=Sir Ray Whitney |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/9478296/Sir-Ray-Whitney.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |access-date=17 August 2015 |quote=Red Guards scaled the British mission's wall as diplomats watched the Ealing comedy ''Two-Way Stretch''.

The Chinese set fire to the mission, then used a battering ram on the steel emergency door.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage crisis at the American embassy in Tehran, Iran]] (1979–1981), and the [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]] at the ambassador's residence in [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (1996-1997).

==Role==
[[File:Embassy of Nicaragua.JPG|thumb|250px|Embassy of Nicaragua in Washington, D.C.|[[Embassy of Nicaragua in Washington, D.C.]].]]The Vienna Convention states:&lt;blockquote&gt;The functions of a diplomatic mission consist, ''inter alia'', in representing the sending State in the receiving State; protecting in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals, within the limits permitted by international law; negotiating with the Government of the receiving State; ascertaining by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State, and reporting thereon to the Government of the sending State; promoting friendly relations between the sending State and the receiving State, and developing their economic, cultural and scientific relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf |title=Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relationships, article 3 |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Diplomatic missions between members of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]] are not called embassies, but [[high commission (Commonwealth)|high commission]]s, for Commonwealth nations share a special diplomatic relationship. It is generally expected that an embassy of a Commonwealth country in a non-Commonwealth country will do its best to provide diplomatic services to citizens from other Commonwealth countries if the citizen's country does not have an embassy in that country. Canadian and Australian nationals enjoy even greater cooperation between their respective consular services, as outlined in the [[Canada-Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement]]. The same kind of procedure is also followed multilaterally by the member states of the [[European Union]] (EU). European citizens in need of consular help in a country without diplomatic or consular representation of their own country may turn to any consular or diplomatic mission of another EU member state.

The rights and immunities (such as [[diplomatic immunity]]) of diplomatic missions are codified in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]].

==Multiple missions in a city==
Some cities may host more than one mission from the same country. An example is Rome, where many states maintain missions to [[Foreign relations of Italy|Italy]] and another to the [[Holy See]]. It is not customary for these missions to share premises nor diplomatic personnel. At present, only the [[Iraq]]i missions to Italy and the [[Holy See]] share premises; however, two ambassadors are appointed, one to each country. In the case of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|UN's Food Agencies]], the Head of Mission to the Italian Republic is usually accredited as [[permanent representative]]. The United States maintains a separate [[United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome]], whose head is the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture]]. [[Kolkata]] in India hosts two Bangladeshi Deputy High Commissions, one at [[Park Circus]] and another, opened later, at Mirza Galib Street. This was done to reduce overcrowding inside the Deputy High Commission. Both the Deputy High Commissions issue Bangladeshi visas.

==Non-diplomatic offices==
{{main|De facto embassy}}

Governments of [[List of states with limited recognition|states not recognized by the receiving state]] and of territories that make no claim to be sovereign states may set up offices abroad that do not have official diplomatic status as defined by the Vienna Convention. Examples are the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]]s that represent the government of the [[Republic of China]]; [[Somaliland]]'s Representative Offices in London, [[Addis Ababa]], Rome, and [[Washington, D.C.]]; the [[Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office]]s that represent the government of that territory. Such offices assume some of the non-diplomatic functions of diplomatic posts, such as promoting trade interests and providing assistance to its citizens and residents. They are nevertheless not diplomatic missions, their personnel are not diplomats and do not have diplomatic visas, although there may be legislation providing for personal immunities and tax privileges, as in the case of the Hong Kong offices in London and Toronto, for example.

{{Politics sidebar|Disciplines}}
'''International relations''' ('''IR''') or '''international affairs''' ('''IA''') — commonly also referred to as '''international studies''' ('''IS'''), '''global studies''' ('''GS'''), or '''global affairs''' ('''GA''') — is the study in interconnectedness of [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[law]] on a global level. Depending on the academic institution, it is either a field of [[political science]], an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field similar to [[global studies]], or an entirely independent academic [[Discipline (academia)|discipline]] in which students take a variety of internationally focused courses in [[social science]] and [[humanities]] disciplines. In all cases, the field studies relationships between ''political entities'' ([[polity|polities]]) such as [[sovereign state]]s, [[international organization|inter-governmental organizations]] (IGOs), [[international non-governmental organization]]s (INGOs), other [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), and [[multinational corporation]]s (MNCs), and the wider [[world-system]]s produced by this interaction. International relations is an [[academic]] and a [[public policy]] field, and so can be [[Positive statement|positive]] and [[Normative statement|normative]], because it analyses and formulates the [[foreign policy]] of a given state.

As political activity, international relations dates from the time of the Greek historian [[Thucydides]] ({{circa|460–395 BC}}), and, in the early 20th century, became a discrete academic field (no. 5901 in the [[4-digit UNESCO Nomenclature]]) within political science. In practice, international relations and international affairs forms a separate academic program or field from political science, and the courses taught therein are highly interdisciplinary.&lt;ref&gt;"International Relation", ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' (1993) pp.000–0000.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, international relations draws from the fields of [[politics]], [[economics]], [[international law]], [[communication studies]], [[history]], [[demography]], [[area studies|geography]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[criminology]] and [[psychology]]. The scope of international relations encompasses issues such as [[globalization]], [[diplomatic relations]], [[Sovereign state|state sovereignty]], [[international security]], [[ecological]] [[sustainability]], [[nuclear proliferation]], [[nationalism]], [[economic development]], [[global finance]], [[terrorism]], and [[human rights]].

==History==
{{see also|International relations, 1648–1814|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)|International relations (1919–1939)|Diplomatic history of World War II|Cold War}}
Studies of international relations start thousands of years ago; [[Barry Buzan]] and Richard Little, for example, consider the interaction of ancient [[Sumer]]ian city-states, starting in 3,500 [[Anno Domini|BC]], as the first fully-fledged international system.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Buzan, Richard Little. ''International Systems in World History: Remaking the Study of International Relations'' (2000)/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:French Spanish and Polish fashion.jpg|thumb|The official portraits of King [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław IV]] dressed according to [[Kingdom of France|French]], [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and Polish fashion reflects the complex politics of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]

The history of international relations based on [[sovereign states]] and many more types are often traced back to the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648, a stepping stone in the development of the modern state system. Prior to this the European medieval organization of political authority was based on a vaguely hierarchical religious order. Contrary to popular belief, Westphalia still embodied layered systems of sovereignty, especially within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Beaulac: "The Westphalian Model in defining International Law: Challenging the Myth", ''Australian Journal of Legal History'' Vol. 9 (2004), [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AJLH/2004/9.html]; Krasner, Stephen D.: "Westphalia and all that" in Judith Goldstein &amp; Robert Keohane (eds): ''Ideas and Foreign Policy'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1993), pp.235–264&lt;/ref&gt; More than the Peace of Westphalia, the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 is thought to reflect an emerging norm that sovereigns had no internal equals within a defined territory and no external superiors as the ultimate authority within the territory's sovereign borders.

The centuries of roughly 1500 to 1789 saw the rise of the independent, sovereign [[Sovereign state|states]], the institutionalization of [[diplomacy]] and armies. The [[French Revolution]] added to this the new idea that not princes or an oligarchy, but the citizenry of a state, defined as the nation, should be defined as sovereign. Such a state in which the nation is sovereign would thence be termed a [[nation-state]] (as opposed to a monarchy or a religious state). The term [[republic]] increasingly became its synonym. An alternative model of the nation-state was developed in reaction to the French republican concept by the Germans and others, who instead of giving the citizenry sovereignty, kept the princes and nobility, but defined nation-statehood in ethnic-linguistic terms, establishing the rarely if ever fulfilled ideal that all people speaking one language should belong to one state only. The same claim to sovereignty was made for both forms of nation-state. (In Europe today, few states conform to either definition of nation-state: many continue to have royal sovereigns, and hardly any are ethnically homogeneous.)

The particular European system supposing the sovereign equality of states was exported to the Americas, Africa, and Asia via [[colonialism]] and the "standards of civilization". The contemporary international system was finally established through [[decolonization]] during the [[Cold War]]. However, this is somewhat over-simplified. While the nation-state system is considered "modern", many states have not incorporated the system and are termed "pre-modern".

Further, a handful of states have moved beyond insistence on full sovereignty, and can be considered "post-modern". The ability of contemporary IR discourse to explain the relations of these different types of states is disputed. "Levels of analysis" is a way of looking at the international system, which includes the individual level, the domestic state as a unit, the international level of transnational and intergovernmental affairs, and the global level.

What is explicitly recognized as international relations theory was not developed until after [[World War I]], and is dealt with in more detail below. IR theory, however, has a long tradition of drawing on the work of other [[social science]]s. The use of capitalizations of the "I" and "R" in international relations aims to distinguish the academic discipline of international relations from the phenomena of international relations. Many cite [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' (6th century BC), [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' (5th century BC), [[Chanakya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]'' (4th century BC), as the inspiration for realist theory, with [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' and [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' providing further elaboration.

Similarly, [[liberal international relations theory|liberalism]] draws upon the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Jean Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], with the work of the former often being cited as the first elaboration of [[democratic peace theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/|publisher=Stanford press|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though contemporary human rights is considerably different from the type of rights envisioned under [[natural law]], [[Francisco de Vitoria]], [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[John Locke]] offered the first accounts of universal entitlement to certain rights on the basis of common humanity. In the 20th century, in addition to contemporary theories of [[liberal internationalism]], [[Marxism]] has been a foundation of international relations.

===Study of international relations===
[[File:UN Members Flags2.JPG|thumb|Flags of the member states of the [[United Nations]]]]
International relations as a distinct field of study began in [[Great Britain|Britain]]. IR emerged as a formal [[academic discipline]] in 1919 with the founding of the first IR professorship: the Woodrow Wilson Chair at [[Aberystwyth]], [[University of Wales]] (now [[Aberystwyth University]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/interpol/|title=Aberystwyth University – Department of International Politics|website=www.aber.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; held by [[Alfred Eckhard Zimmern]]&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abadía|first=Adolfo A.|date=2015|title=Del liberalismo al neo-realismo. Un debate en torno al realismo clásico |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278025848|journal=Telos. Revista de Estudios Interdisciplinarios en Ciencias Sociales|language=es|volume=17|issue=3|pages=438–459|issn=1317-0570}}&lt;/ref&gt; and endowed by [[David Davies, 1st Baron Davies|David Davies]]. [[Georgetown University]]'s [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] is the oldest international relations faculty in the [[United States]], founded in 1919. In the early 1920s, the [[London School of Economics]]' department of international relations was founded at the behest of [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Philip Noel-Baker]]: this was the first institute to offer a wide range of degrees in the field. This was rapidly followed by establishment of IR at universities in the US and in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. The creation of the posts of [[Montague Burton Professor of International Relations]] at LSE and at Oxford gave further impetus to the academic study of international relations. Furthermore, the International History department at LSE developed a focus on the history of IR in the [[early modern]], [[History of colonialism|colonial]] and [[Cold War]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Walter |editor-last=Carlsnaes |display-editors=etal |title=Handbook of International Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0uVHo4ZLc4C&amp;pg=PA5|year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=1–28|accessdate=2016-02-24|isbn=9781446265031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first university entirely dedicated to the study of IR was the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] (now the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]]), which was founded in 1927 to form diplomats associated to the [[League of Nations]]. The [[Committee on International Relations (University of Chicago) |Committee on International Relations]] at the [[University of Chicago]] was the first to offer a [[graduate degree]], in 1928. [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], a collaboration between [[Tufts University]] and [[Harvard]], opened its doors in 1933 as the first graduate-only school of international affairs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://fletcher.tufts.edu/About/Fletcher-History|title = A History of Excellence|website = The Fletcher School|publisher = Tufts}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, [[Glendon College]] and the [[Norman Paterson School of International Affairs]] were the first institutions in Canada to offer an undergraduate and a graduate program in international studies and affairs, respectively. Also in Canada, in 2000, [[Peter Munk]] sponsored the formation of the [[Munk School of Global Affairs]], which, with its flagship program the Master of Global Affairs (MGA), considers IR with a particular emphasis on the implications for the private sector.

==Theory==
{{Confusing|section|reason=the structure and categorisation may be confusing|date=March 2019}}
{{Main|International relations theory}}

===Normativity===
IR theories can be categorised on the basis of normativity. In line with the [[is–ought problem]], non-normative [[Empirical theory|empirical]] theories seek to explain why certain events or trends exist in world politics (what the world ''is''), whereas [[normative]] theories are concerned with the events or trends that should exist (what the world ''ought'' to be) and how to make [[Ethics|ethical]] judgements accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Griffiths |first=Martin |date=2007 |title=International Relations Theory for the Twenty-First Century: An introduction |url=https://hostnezt.com/cssfiles/internationalrelations/International-Relations-Theory-for-21st-Century.pdf |location= |publisher=Routledge |page=xiii |isbn= |author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith, Baylis &amp; Owens (2008) make the case that the normative position is to make the world a better place, and that this theoretical [[worldview]] aims to do so by being aware of implicit assumptions and explicit assumptions that constitute a non-normative position and align or position the normative towards the [[:wikt:loci|loci]] of other key socio-political theories such as political [[liberalism]], [[Marxism]], political [[Constructivism (international relations) |constructivism]], political [[Realism (international relations)|realism]], political [[idealism]] and political [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780199297771|edition = Fourth |pages =2–13|title= The Globalization of World Politics: An Introduction to International Relations |first1 = John|last1= Baylis|first2= Steve|last2= Smith |first3= Patricia|last3= Owens|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology===
IR theories are also roughly divided into one of two [[epistemology|epistemological]] camps: "positivist" and "post-positivist". Positivist theories aim to replicate the [[Scientific method|methods of the natural sciences]] by analyzing the impact of material forces. They typically focus on features of international relations such as state interactions, size of military forces, and [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of powers]]. Post-positivist epistemology rejects the idea that the social world can be studied in an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and value-free way. It rejects the central ideas of neo-realism/liberalism, such as [[rational choice theory]], on the grounds that the scientific method cannot be applied to the social world and that a "science" of IR is impossible.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

A key difference between the two positions is that while positivist theories, such as neo-realism, offer causal explanations (such as why and how power is exercised), post-positivist theories focus instead on constitutive questions, for instance what is meant by "power"; what makes it up, how it is experienced and how it is reproduced. Often, post-positivist theories explicitly promote a normative approach to IR, by considering ethics. This is something which has often been ignored under "traditional" IR as positivist theories make a distinction between "facts" and normative judgments, or "values". During the late 1980s and the 1990s, debate between positivists and post-positivists became the dominant debate and has been described as constituting the Third "Great Debate" (Lapid 1989).

===Schools of thought===

====Realism====
[[Realism (international relations)|Realism]] focuses on state security and power above all else. Early realists such as [[E. H. Carr]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]] argued that states are self-interested, power-seeking rational actors, who seek to maximize their security and chances of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morganthau|first=Hans|title=Politics Among Nations: The struggle for Power and Peace|year=1978|location=New York|pages=4–15|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/morg6.htm|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperation between states is a way to maximize each individual state's security (as opposed to more idealistic reasons). Similarly, any act of war must be based on self-interest, rather than on idealism. Many realists saw [[World War II]] as the vindication of their theory.

Realists argue that the need for survival requires state leaders to distance themselves from traditional morality. Realism taught American leaders to focus on interests rather than on ideology, to seek peace through strength, and to recognize that great powers can coexist even if they have antithetical values and beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Globalization of World Politics|last=Baylis|first=John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-956909-0|location=|pages=86–87|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', written by [[Thucydides]], is considered a foundational text of the realist school of political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Cochrane, Charles|title=Thucydides and the Science of History|date=1929|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate over whether Thucydides himself was a realist; Ned Lebow has argued that seeing Thucydides as a realist is a misinterpretation of a more complex political message within his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lebow|first=Richard Ned|date=2001|title=Thucydides the Constructivist|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=95|issue=3|pages=547–560|jstor=3118232|doi=10.1017/S0003055401003112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst others, philosophers like [[Machiavelli]], [[Hobbes]] and [[Rousseau]] are considered to have contributed to the Realist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baylis|first=John|title=The globalization of world politics : an introduction to international relations|date=2001|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0198782636|page=[https://archive.org/details/globalizationofw0002unse/page/149 149]|edition=2.|author2=Smith, Steve|url=https://archive.org/details/globalizationofw0002unse/page/149}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while their work may support realist doctrine, it is not likely that they would have classified themselves as realists in this sense. [[Political realism]] believes that politics, like society, is governed by objective laws with roots in [[human nature]]. To improve society, it is first necessary to understand the laws by which society lives. The operation of these laws being impervious to our preferences, persons will challenge them only at the risk of failure. Realism, believing as it does in the objectivity of the laws of politics, must also believe in the possibility of developing a rational theory that reflects, however imperfectly and one-sidedly, these objective laws. It believes also, then, in the possibility of distinguishing in politics between truth and opinion—between what is true objectively and rationally, supported by evidence and illuminated by reason, and what is only a subjective judgment, divorced from the facts as they are and informed by prejudice and wishful thinking.

Placing realism under positivism is far from unproblematic however. E. H. Carr's "What is History" was a deliberate critique of positivism, and [[Hans Morgenthau]]'s aim in "Scientific Man vs Power Politics" was to demolish any conception that international politics/power politics can be studied scientifically. Morgenthau's belief in this regard is part of the reason he has been classified as a "classical realist" rather than a realist.

Major theorists include [[E. H. Carr]], [[Robert Gilpin]], [[Charles P. Kindleberger]], [[Stephen D. Krasner]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], [[Samuel P. Huntington]], [[Kenneth Waltz]], [[Stephen Walt]], and [[John Mearsheimer]].

====Liberalism====
{{Main|Liberalism (international relations)}}
{{See also|Liberal internationalism}}

According to liberalism, individuals are basically good and capable of meaningful cooperation to promote positive change. Liberalism views states, nongovernmental organizations, and intergovernmental organizations as key actors in the international system. States have many interests and are not necessarily unitary and autonomous, although they are sovereign. Liberal theory stresses interdependence among states, multinational corporations, and international institutions. Theorists such as [[Hedley Bull]] have postulated an international society in which various actors communicate and recognize common rules, institutions, and interests. Liberals also view the international system as anarchic since there is no single overarching international authority and each individual state is left to act in its own self-interest. Liberalism is historically rooted in the liberal philosophical traditions associated with [[Adam Smith]] and Immanuel Kant that posit that human nature is basically good and that individual self-interest can be harnessed by society to promote aggregate social welfare. Individuals form groups and later, states; states are generally cooperative and tend to follow international norms.&lt;ref name="Mingst, Karen A. 2011"&gt;Mingst, Karen A., &amp; Arreguín-Toft, Ivan M. (2011). Essentials of International Relations (5th ed.). New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liberal international relations theory]] arose after World War I in response to the inability of states to control and limit war in their international relations. Early adherents include [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Norman Angell]], who argued that states mutually gained from cooperation and that war was so destructive as to be essentially futile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Woodrow|title=History Learning site|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/woodrow_wilson.htm|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberalism was not recognized as a coherent theory as such until it was collectively and derisively termed idealism by [[E. H. Carr]]. A new version of "idealism" that focused on [[human rights]] as the basis of the legitimacy of [[international law]] was advanced by [[Hans Köchler]].

Major theorists include [[Montesquieu]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Michael W. Doyle]], [[Francis Fukuyama]], and [[Helen Milner]].&lt;ref&gt;Mingst, Karen A., &amp; Snyder, Jack L. (2011). Essential Readings in World Politics (4th ed.). New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

======Neoliberalism======
{{Further|Complex interdependence}}
[[neoliberalism in international relations|Neoliberalism]] seeks to update liberalism by accepting the neorealist presumption that states are the key actors in international relations, but still maintains that [[non-state actor]]s (NSAs) and [[intergovernmental organizations]] (IGOs) matter. Proponents argue that states will cooperate irrespective of [[relative gains]], and are thus concerned with [[absolute gains]]. This also means that nations are, in essence, free to make their own choices as to how they will go about conducting policy without any [[international organization]]s blocking a nation's right to [[sovereignty]]. Neoliberal institutionalism, an approach founded by Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, emphasize the important role of international institutions in maintaining an open global trading regime.

Prominent neoliberal institutionalists are [[John Ikenberry]], [[Robert Keohane]], and [[Joseph Nye]].

======Regime theory======
[[Regime theory]] is derived from the liberal tradition that argues that international institutions or regimes affect the behaviour of states (or other international actors). It assumes that cooperation is possible in the anarchic system of states, indeed, regimes are by definition, instances of international cooperation.

While [[realism (international relations)|realism]] predicts that conflict should be the norm in international relations, regime theorists say that there is cooperation despite anarchy. Often they cite cooperation in trade, human rights and [[collective security]] among other issues. These instances of cooperation are regimes. The most commonly cited definition of regimes comes from [[Stephen Krasner]], who defines regimes as "principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actor expectations converge in a given issue-area".&lt;ref&gt;Krasner, Stephen D., ed. 1983. "Structural Causes and Regime Consequences: Regimes as Intervening Variables." In ''International Regimes'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press, pp. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all approaches to regime theory, however, are liberal or neoliberal; some realist scholars like [[Joseph Grieco]] have developed hybrid theories which take a realist based approach to this fundamentally liberal theory. (Realists do not say cooperation ''never'' happens, just that it is not the norm; it is a difference of degree).

====Post-positivist/reflectivist theories====

=====Constructivism=====
{{Main|Constructivism (international relations)}}
[[Radical constructionism|Social constructivism]] encompasses a broad range of theories that aim to address questions of [[ontology]], such as the [[structure and agency|structure-and-agency]] debate, as well as questions of [[epistemology]], such as the "material/ideational" debate that concerns the relative role of material forces versus ideas. Constructivism is not a theory of IR in the manner of neo-realism, but is instead a [[social theory]] which is used to better explain the actions taken by states and other major actors as well as the identities that guide these states and actors.

[[Constructivism in international politics|Constructivism in IR]] can be divided into what [[Ted Hopf]] (1998) calls "conventional" and "critical" constructivism. Common to all varieties of constructivism is an interest in the role that ideational forces play. The most famous constructivist scholar, [[Alexander Wendt]], noted in a 1992 article in ''[[International Organization]]'' —and later in his 1999 book ''Social Theory of International Politics—''that "anarchy is what states make of it". By this he means that the anarchical structure that neo-realists claim governs state interaction is in fact a phenomenon that is socially constructed and reproduced by states.

For example, if the system is dominated by states that see anarchy as a life or death situation (what Wendt terms a "Hobbesian" anarchy) then the system will be characterized by warfare. If on the other hand anarchy is seen as restricted (a "Lockean" anarchy) then a more peaceful system will exist. Anarchy in this view is constituted by state interaction, rather than accepted as a natural and immutable feature of international life as viewed by neo-realist IR scholars.

Prominent social constructivist IR scholars are [[Rawi Abdelal]], [[Michael N. Barnett|Michael Barnett]], [[Mark Blyth]], [[Martha Finnemore]], [[Ted Hopf]], [[Kathryn Sikkink]] and [[Alexander Wendt]].

=====Marxism=====
[[Marxism|Marxist]] and Neo-Marxist theories of IR reject the realist/liberal view of state conflict or cooperation; instead focusing on the economic and material aspects. It makes the assumption that the economy trumps other concerns; allowing for the elevation of class as the focus of study. Marxists view the international system as an integrated capitalist system in pursuit of capital accumulation. Thus, [[colonialism]] brought in sources for raw materials and [[captive markets]] for exports, while [[decolonialization]] brought new opportunities in the form of dependence.

A prominent derivative of Marxian thought is [[critical international relations theory]] which is the application of "[[critical theory]]" to international relations. Early critical theorists were associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] which followed Marx's concern with the conditions that allow for social change and the establishment of rational institutions.  Their emphasis on the "critical" component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of positivism. Modern-day proponents such as [[Andrew Linklater]], [[Robert W. Cox]] and [[Ken Booth (academic)|Ken Booth]] focus on the need for human [[freedom (political)|emancipation]] from the nation-state. Hence, it is "critical" of mainstream IR theories that tend to be both positivist and state-centric.

Further linked in with Marxist theories is [[dependency theory]] and the [[Core-periphery|core–periphery model]], which argue that developed countries, in their pursuit of power, appropriate developing states through international banking, security and trade agreements and unions on a formal level, and do so through the interaction of political and financial advisors, missionaries, relief aid workers, and MNCs on the informal level, in order to integrate them into the capitalist system, strategically appropriating undervalued natural resources and labor hours and fostering economic and political dependence.

Marxist theories receive little attention in the United States. It is more common in parts of Europe and is one of the more important theoretic contributions of Latin American academia to the study of global networks.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=====Feminism=====
{{Main|Feminism (international relations)}}
Feminist IR considers the ways that international politics affects and is affected by both men and women and also at how the core concepts that are employed within the discipline of IR (e.g. war, security, etc.) are themselves gendered. Feminist IR has not only concerned itself with the traditional focus of IR on states, wars, diplomacy and security, but feminist IR scholars have also emphasized the importance of looking at how gender shapes the current global political economy. In this sense, there is no clear cut division between feminists working in IR and those working in the area of International Political Economy (IPE). From its inception, feminist IR has also theorized extensively about men and, in particular, masculinities. Many IR feminists argue that the discipline is inherently masculine in nature. For example, in her article "Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals" Signs (1988), Carol Cohn claimed that a highly masculinized culture within the defence establishment contributed to the divorcing of war from human emotion.

Feminist IR emerged largely from the late 1980s onwards. The end of the Cold War and the re-evaluation of traditional IR theory during the 1990s opened up a space for gendering International Relations. Because feminist IR is linked broadly to the critical project in IR, by and large most feminist scholarship has sought to problematize the politics of knowledge construction within the discipline – often by adopting methodologies of deconstructivism associated with postmodernism/poststructuralism. However, the growing influence of feminist and women-centric approaches within the international policy communities (for example at the World Bank and the United Nations) is more reflective of the liberal feminist emphasis on equality of opportunity for women.

Prominent scholars include [[Carol Cohn]], [[Cynthia Enloe]], [[Sara Ruddick]], and [[J. Ann Tickner]].

=====International society theory (the English school)=====
{{Main|English school of international relations theory}}
International society theory, also called the English School, focuses on the shared norms and values of states and how they regulate international relations. Examples of such norms include diplomacy, order, and [[public international law|international law]]. Unlike neo-realism, it is not necessarily positivist. Theorists have focused particularly on humanitarian intervention, and are subdivided between solidarists, who tend to advocate it more, and pluralists, who place greater value in order and sovereignty. Nicholas Wheeler is a prominent solidarist, while [[Hedley Bull]] and [[Robert H. Jackson]] are perhaps the best known pluralists.

====Post-structuralist theories====
Post-structuralism theories of international relations developed in the 1980s from [[Postmodernism (international relations)|postmodernist studies in political science]]. Post-structuralism explores the deconstruction of concepts traditionally not problematic in IR (such as "power" and "agency") and examines how the construction of these concepts shapes international relations. The examination of "narratives" plays an important part in poststructuralist analysis; for example, [[Post-structural feminism|feminist poststructuralist]] work has examined the role that "women" play in global society and how they are constructed in war as "innocent" and "civilians". (See also [[Feminism (international relations)|feminism in international relations]].) Rosenberg's article "Why is there no International Historical Sociology"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=Justin|date=2006|title=Why is There No International Historical Sociology?|journal=European Journal of International Relations|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=307–340|doi=10.1177/1354066106067345|issn=1354-0661}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a key text in the evolution of this strand of international relations theory. Post-structuralism has garnered both significant praise and criticism, with its critics arguing that post-structuralist research often fails to address the real-world problems that international relations studies is supposed to contribute to solving.

===Leadership theories===

====Interest group perspective====
[[Interest group]] theory posits that the driving force behind state behaviour is sub-state interest groups. Examples of interest groups include political [[lobbyists]], the military, and the corporate sector. Group theory argues that although these interest groups are constitutive of the state, they are also causal forces in the exercise of state power.

====Strategic perspective====
Strategic perspective is a theoretical approach that views individuals as choosing their actions by taking into account the anticipated actions and responses of others with the intention of maximizing their own welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/strategic-planning-organization|title=Strategic planning|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inherent bad faith model====
{{Further|Bad faith|inherent bad faith model}}
The "[[inherent bad faith model]]" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between [[John Foster Dulles]]' beliefs and his model of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stuart | first1 = Douglas   | last2 = Starr | first2 = Harvey | year = 1981 | title = The 'Inherent Bad Faith Model' Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 3/4 | pages = 1–33 | jstor = 3791139 | doi = 10.2307/3791139 | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.&lt;ref&gt;"...the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one’s opponent...", ''The handbook of social psychology'', Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, [[Susan T. Fiske]], Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt; A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are [[John Foster Dulles]]' position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israel's initial position on the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;"...the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one's opponent", The handbook of social psychology, Volumes 1–2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of analysis&lt;!--'Levels of analysis in international relations' and 'Levels of Analysis in international relations' redirect here--&gt;==

===Systemic level concepts===
International relations are often viewed in terms of '''levels of analysis'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. The ''systemic level'' concepts are those broad concepts that define and shape an international milieu, characterized by [[Anarchy in international relations|anarchy]]. Focusing on the systemic level of international relations is often, but not always, the preferred method for neo-realists and other structuralist IR analysts.

====Sovereignty====
{{main|Westphalian sovereignty}}
Preceding the concepts of interdependence and dependence, international relations relies on the idea of sovereignty. Described in [[Jean Bodin]]'s "Six Books of the Commonwealth" in 1576, the three pivotal points derived from the book describe sovereignty as being a state, that the sovereign power(s) have absolute power over their territories, and that such a power is only limited by the sovereign's "own obligations towards other sovereigns and individuals".&lt;ref&gt;p. 13, N. Oluwafemi Mimiko. "Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: [[Carolina Academic Press]], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a foundation of sovereignty permits, is indicated by a sovereign's obligation to other sovereigns, interdependence and dependence to take place. While throughout world history there have been instances of groups lacking or losing sovereignty, such as African nations prior to Decolonization or the occupation of Iraq during the [[Iraq War]], there is still a need for sovereignty in terms of assessing international relations.

====Power====
{{main|Power (international relations)}}
The concept of Power in international relations can be described as the degree of resources, capabilities, and influence in international affairs. It is often divided up into the concepts of [[hard power]] and [[soft power]], hard power relating primarily to coercive power, such as the use of force, and soft power commonly covering [[economics]], [[diplomacy]] and [[culture|cultural]] influence. However, there is no clear dividing line between the two forms of power.

====National interest====
Perhaps the most significant concept behind that of power and sovereignty, [[national interest]] is a state's action in relation to other states where it seeks to gain advantage or benefits to itself. National interest, whether aspirational or operational, is divided by core/vital and peripheral/non-vital interests. Core or vital interests constitute the things which a country is willing to defend or expand with conflict such as territory, ideology (religious, political, economic), or its citizens. Peripheral or non-vital are interests which a state is willing to compromise. For example, in the German annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] in 1938 (a part of Czechoslovakia) under the [[Munich Agreement]], Czechoslovakia was willing to relinquish territory which was considered ethnically German in order to preserve its own integrity and sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;p. 17-20, N. Oluwafemi Mimiko. "Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: Carolina Academic Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-state actors====
In the 21st century, the status-quo of the international system is no longer monopolized by states alone. Rather, it is the presence of non-state actors, who autonomously act to implement unpredictable behaviour to the international system. Whether it is [[transnational corporations]], [[liberation movements]], [[non-governmental agencies]], or [[international organizations]], these entities have the potential to significantly influence the outcome of any international transaction. Additionally, this also includes the individual person as while the individual is what constitutes the states collective entity, the individual does have the potential to also create unpredicted behaviours. [[Al-Qaeda]], as an example of a non-state actor, has significantly influenced the way states (and non-state actors) conduct international affairs.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 14–15, N. Oluwafemi Mimiko. "Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: Carolina Academic Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Power blocs====
The existence of power blocs in international relations is a significant factor related to [[Polarity (international relations)|polarity]]. During the [[Cold War]], the alignment of several nations to one side or another based on ideological differences or national interests has become an endemic feature of international relations. Unlike prior, shorter-term blocs, the Western and Soviet blocs sought to spread their national ideological differences to other nations. Leaders like U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] under the [[Truman Doctrine]] believed it was necessary to spread democracy whereas the [[Warsaw Pact]] under Soviet policy sought to spread communism. After the Cold War, and the dissolution of the ideologically homogeneous Eastern bloc still gave rise to others such as the [[South-South Cooperation]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 15–16, N. Oluwafemi Mimiko. "Globalization: The Politics of Global Economic Relations and International Business." Durham: Carolina Academic Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Polarity=====
{{main|Polarity (international relations)}}
Polarity in international relations refers to the arrangement of power within the international system. The concept arose from bipolarity during the [[Cold War]], with the international system dominated by the conflict between two [[superpower]]s, and has been applied retrospectively by theorists. However, the term bipolar was notably used by Stalin who said he saw the international system as a bipolar one with two opposing powerbases and ideologies. Consequently, the international system prior to 1945 can be described as '''multipolar''', with power being shared among [[Great powers]].

[[File:World empires and colonies around World War I.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Empires of the world in 1910]]
The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 had led to unipolarity, with the United States as a sole superpower, although many refuse to acknowledge the fact. [[People's Republic of China|China's]] continued rapid economic growth (in 2010 it became the world's second-largest economy), combined with the respectable international position they hold within political spheres and the power that the Chinese Government exerts over their people (consisting of the largest population in the world), resulted in debate over whether China is now a superpower or a possible candidate in the future. However, China's strategic force unable of projecting power beyond its region and its nuclear arsenal of 250 warheads (compared to 7700 of the United States&lt;ref&gt;[[Historical nuclear weapons stockpiles and nuclear tests by country]]&lt;/ref&gt;) mean that the unipolarity will persist in the policy-relevant future.

Several theories of international relations draw upon the idea of [[polarity (power)|polarity]]. The [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] was a concept prevalent in Europe prior to the [[First World War]], the thought being that by balancing power blocs it would create stability and prevent war. Theories of the balance of power gained prominence again during the [[Cold War]], being a central mechanism of [[Kenneth Waltz]]'s Neorealism. Here, the concepts of balancing (rising in power to counter another) and bandwagonning (siding with another) are developed.

[[Robert Gilpin]]'s [[Hegemonic stability theory]] also draws upon the idea of polarity, specifically the state of unipolarity. [[Hegemony]] is the preponderance of power at one pole in the international system, and the theory argues this is a stable configuration because of mutual gains by both the dominant power and others in the international system. This is contrary to many neorealist arguments, particularly made by [[Kenneth Waltz]], stating that the end of the [[Cold War]] and the state of unipolarity is an unstable configuration that will inevitably change.

The case of Gilpin proved to be correct and Waltz's article titled "The Stability of a Bipolar World" &lt;ref&gt;Daedalus, 93/3: (1964), 881–909&lt;/ref&gt; was followed in 1999 by [[William Wohlforth]]'s article titled "The Stability of a Unipolar World"&lt;ref&gt;International Security, 24/1: (1999), 5–41&lt;/ref&gt;

Waltz's thesis can be expressed in [[power transition theory]], which states that it is likely that a [[great power]] would challenge a hegemon after a certain period, resulting in a major war. It suggests that while hegemony can control the occurrence of wars, it also results in the creation of one. Its main proponent, [[A. F. K. Organski]], argued this based on the occurrence of previous wars during British, Portuguese, and Dutch hegemony.

====Interdependence====
Many advocate that the current international system is characterized by growing interdependence; the mutual responsibility and dependency on others. Advocates of this point to growing [[globalization]], particularly with international economic interaction. The role of international institutions, and widespread acceptance of a number of operating principles in the international system, reinforces ideas that relations are characterized by interdependence.

====Dependency====
[[File:ISAF soldier looking for enemy positions in Kunar Province of Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|[[NATO]] [[International Security Assistance Force]] in [[Afghanistan]]]]
[[Dependency theory]] is a theory most commonly associated with [[Marxism]], stating that a set of core states exploit a set of weaker periphery states for their prosperity. Various versions of the theory suggest that this is either an inevitability (standard dependency theory), or use the theory to highlight the necessity for change (Neo-Marxist).

====Systemic tools of international relations====
* [[Diplomacy]] is the practice of communication and '''negotiation''' between representatives of states. To some extent, all other tools of international relations can be considered the failure of diplomacy. Keeping in mind, the use of other tools are part of the communication and negotiation inherent within diplomacy. Sanctions, force, and adjusting trade regulations, while not typically considered part of diplomacy, are actually valuable tools in the interest of leverage and placement in negotiations.
* [[International sanctions|Sanctions]] are usually a first resort after the failure of diplomacy, and are one of the main tools used to enforce treaties. They can take the form of diplomatic or economic sanctions and involve the cutting of ties and imposition of barriers to communication or trade.
* [[War]], the use of force, is often thought of as the ultimate tool of international relations. A popular definition is that given by [[Carl von Clausewitz]], with war being "the continuation of politics by other means". There is a growing study into "new wars" involving actors other than states. The study of war in international relations is covered by the disciplines of "[[war studies]]" and "[[strategic studies]]".
* The mobilization of international shame can also be thought of as a tool of international relations. This is attempting to alter states' actions through '[[name and shame|naming and shaming]]' at the international level. This is mostly done by the large human rights NGOs such as [[Amnesty International]] (for instance when it called Guantanamo Bay a "Gulag"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/POL10/014/2005/en%3E|title=Error – Amnesty International|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Human Rights Watch]]. A prominent use of was the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] 1235 procedure, which publicly exposes state's human rights violations. The current [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] has yet to use this mechanism
* The allotment of economic and/or diplomatic benefits such as the [[European Union]]'s [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement policy]]; candidate countries are only allowed to join if they meet the [[Copenhagen criteria]].
* The mutual exchange of ideas, information, art, music and language among nations through [[cultural diplomacy]] has also been recognized by governments as an important tool in the development of international relations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xAgkDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cultural+diplomacy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAmeT22rbeAhUCc98KHaLzCW4Q6AEIVzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20diplomacy&amp;f=false ''Music, Art and Diplomacy East-West cultural Interactions and the Cold War''] Editors: Siom Mukkonen &amp; Pekka Suutari.

===Unit-level concepts in international relations===
As a level of analysis the unit level is often referred to as the state level, as it locates its explanation at the level of the state, rather than the international system.

====Regime type====
It is often considered that a state's form of government can dictate the way that a state interacts with others in the international relation.

[[Democratic peace theory]] is a theory that suggests that the nature of [[democracy]] means that democratic countries will not go to war with each other. The justifications for this are that democracies externalize their norms and only go to war for just causes, and that democracy encourages mutual trust and respect.

[[Communism]] justifies a world revolution, which similarly would lead to peaceful coexistence, based on a proletarian global society.

====Revisionism/status quo====
States can be classified by whether they accept the international [[status quo]], or are revisionist—i.e., want change. Revisionist states seek to fundamentally change the rules and practices of international relations, feeling disadvantaged by the status quo. They see the international system as a largely western creation which serves to reinforce current realities. [[Japan]] is an example of a state that has gone from being a revisionist state to one that is satisfied with the status quo, because the status quo is now beneficial to it.

====Religion====
Religion can have an effect on the way a state acts within the international system. Different theoretical perspectives treat it in somewhat different fashion. One dramatic example is the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48) that ravaged much of Europe. Religion is visible as an organizing principle particularly for [[Islamic state]]s, whereas secularism sits at the other end of the spectrum, with the separation of state and religion being responsible for the [[liberal international relations theory]]. Events since the [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States, the role of [[Islam]] in [[terrorism]], and the strife in the [[Middle East]] have made it a major topic. There are many different types of religions. One being Confucianism, which is China's major world view (Alexander, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Snyder, ed.|first=Jack|title=Religion and International Relations Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZfrWuXy77sC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=1–23|accessdate=2016-02-24|isbn=9780231153386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual or sub-unit level concepts===
The level beneath the unit (state) level can be useful both for explaining factors in international relations that other theories fail to explain, and for moving away from a state-centric view of international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Morin, Jean-Frederic and Jonathan Paquin, Foreign Policy Analysis: A Toolbox, Palgrave, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Psychological factors in international relations{{spaced ndash}}Evaluating psychological factors in international relations comes from the understanding that a state is not a "black box" as proposed by [[Realism (international relations)|realism]], and that there may be other influences on foreign policy decisions. Examining the role of personalities in the decision making process can have some [[explanatory power]], as can the role of misperception between various actors. A prominent application of sub-unit level psychological factors in international relations is the concept of [[Groupthink]], another is the propensity of policymakers to think in terms of analogies.
* Bureaucratic politics{{spaced ndash}} Looks at the role of the [[bureaucracy]] in decision making, and sees decisions as a result of bureaucratic in-fighting, and as having been shaped by various constraints.
* Religious, ethnic, and secessionist groups{{spaced ndash}} Viewing these aspects of the sub-unit level has explanatory power with regards to [[ethnic conflict]]s, [[religious wars]], transnational [[diaspora]] ([[diaspora politics]]) and other actors which do not consider themselves to fit with the defined state boundaries. This is particularly useful in the context of the pre-modern world of weak states.

[[International organization|International institutions]] form a vital part of contemporary international relations. Much interaction at the system level is governed by them, and they outlaw some traditional institutions and practices of international relations, such as the use of [[war]] (except in self-defence).

===Generalist inter-state organizations===

====United Nations====

Many of the legal institutions follow the same organizational structure as the UN.

====Organisation of Islamic Cooperation====
{{Main|Organisation of Islamic Cooperation}}
The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) is an [[international organization]] consisting of 57 member states. The organisation attempts to be the collective voice of the [[Muslim world]] (Ummah) and attempts to safeguard the interests and ensure the progress and well-being of [[Muslims]].

      <text bytes="7618" xml:space="preserve">'''Religion in politics''' covers various topics related to the effects of [[religion]] on [[politics]]. Religion has been claimed to be "the source of some of the most remarkable political mobilizations of our times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jelen |first1=Ted G. |title=Religion and Politics in Comparative Perspective |date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious political doctrines ==

Various political doctrines have been directly influenced or inspired by religions. Various strands of [[Political Islam]] exist, with most of them falling under the umbrella term of [[Islamism]]. [[Graham E. Fuller|Graham Fuller]] has argued for a broader notion of Islamism as a form of [[identity politics]], involving "support for [Muslim] identity, authenticity, broader regionalism, revivalism, [and] revitalization of the community."&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Graham E., ''The Future of Political Islam'', Palgrave MacMillan, (2003), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; This may often take a [[Social Conservatism|socially conservative]] or [[reactionary]] from, as in [[wahhabism]] and [[salafism]]. Ideologies espousing [[Islamic modernism]] include [[Islamic socialism]] and [[Post-Islamism]].

[[Christianity and politics|Christian political movements]] range from [[Christian socialism]], [[Christian communism]], and [[Christian anarchism]] the left, to [[Christian democracy]] on [[Centrism|the centre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boswell|first1=Jonathan|title=Community and the Economy: The Theory of Public Co-operation|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136159015|page=160|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Christian right]].

Beyond [[Universalism|universalist]] ideologies, religions have also been [[Religious nationalism|involved in nationalist politics]]. [[Hindu nationalism]] exists in the [[Hindutva]] movement. [[Religious Zionism]] seeks to create a [[Halachic state|religious Jewish state]]. The [[Khalistan movement]] aims to create a homeland for [[Sikh]]s.

An extreme form of religious political action is [[religious terrorism]]. [[Islamic terrorism]] has been evident in the actions of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], [[Boko Haram]], [[Taliban]] and [[Al-Qaeda]], all paraticioners of [[jihadism]]. [[Christian terrorism]] has been connected to [[anti-abortion violence]] and [[white supremacy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/20170925/hate-god%E2%80%99s-name|title=Hate In God’s Name|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example in the [[Christian Identity]] movement. [[Saffron terror]] describes terrorism connected [[Hinduism]]. There has also been cases of [[Jewish religious terrorism]], such as the [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]], as well as of [[Sikh]] terrorism, such as the bombing of [[Air India Flight 182]].

== Religious political issues ==

Religious political issues may involve, but are not limited to, those concerning [[freedom of religion]], applications of [[religious law]], and the right to [[religious education]].

== Religion and the State ==

[[State (polity)|State]]s have adopted various attitudes towards religions, ranging from [[theocracy]] to [[state atheism]].

A theocracy is "government by divine guidance or by officials who are regarded as divinely guided".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/theocracy|title=Theocracy {{!}} political system|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern day recognised theocracies include the [[Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tehran/inside/govt.html|title=Inside Iran - The Structure Of Power In Iran {{!}} Terror And Tehran {{!}} FRONTLINE {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2019-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Holy See]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/jun7/vatican-city-created/|title=Vatican City Created|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2013-12-16|website=National Geographic Society|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while the [[Taleban]] and [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] are insurgencies attempting to create such [[polity|polities]]. Historical examples include the Islamic [[Caliphate]]s and the [[Papal States]].

[[File:Map of state religions.svg|thumb|Map of states with official religions. Blue = Christianity, Green = Islam, Yellow = Buddhism]]
A more modest form of religious state activity is having an official [[state religion]]. Unlike a theocracy, this maintains the superiority of the state over the religious authorities. Over 20% (a total of 43) of the countries in the world have a state religion, most of them (27) being Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/03/more-than-20-percent-countries-have-official-state-religions-pew-survey|title=More than 20% of countries have official state religions – survey|last=correspondent|first=Harriet Sherwood Religion|date=2017-10-03|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-12-01|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also 13 officially [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] countries such as [[Bhutan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhutan.com/religion|title=Religion|website=www.bhutan.com|access-date=2019-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while state churches are present in 27 countries.

In contrast to religious states, [[secular state]]s recognise no religion. This is often called the principle of the [[separation of church and state]]. A more extreme version, [[Laïcité]], is practiced in [[France]] and [[Secularism in Turkey|in Turkey]], which prohibits all religious expressions in many public contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/127179/time-france-abandon-laicite|title=Is it Time for France to Abandon Laïcité?|last=Winkler|first=Elizabeth|date=2016-01-07|work=The New Republic|access-date=2019-12-01|issn=0028-6583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states are [[State atheism|explicitly atheistic]], usually those which were produced by [[revolution]], such as various [[socialist state]]s or the [[French First Republic]].

There have also been cases of states [[civic religion|creating their own religions]], such as [[imperial cult]]s or the [[Cult of Reason]].

== Debates about religion in politics ==

There have been arguments for and against a role for religion in politics. [[Yasmin Alibhai-Brown]] has argued that "faith and state should be kept separate" as "the most sinister and oppressive states in the world are those that use God to control the minds and actions of their populations", such as [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newint.org/features/2018/12/17/debate-should-religion-play-role-politics|title=Should religion play a role in politics?|date=2019-01-29|website=New Internationalist|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this, [[Dawn Foster]] has responded that "when religion is fully unmoored from politics it becomes all the more insular and more open to abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newint.org/features/2018/12/17/debate-should-religion-play-role-politics|title=Should religion play a role in politics?|date=2019-01-29|website=New Internationalist|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Topic in sociology}}
'''Political cognition''' refers to the study of how individuals come to understand the political world, and how this understanding leads to political behavior. Some of the processes studied under the umbrella of political cognition include [[attention]], interpretation, judgment, and [[memory]]. Most of the advancements in the area have been made by scholars in the fields of [[social psychology]], [[political science]], and [[communication studies]].

== History ==
In the early 20th century, the psychological study of [[cognition]] encountered significant push back from behaviorism. According to behaviorists, if social psychology was to be considered a serious science, it should study observable and measurable phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=David E.|last2=Carlston|first2=Donal|date=2013-08-22|title=The Emergence of Social Cognition|url=https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199730018.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199730018-e-002|journal=The Oxford Handbook of Social Cognition|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199730018.013.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the processes of the mind are not observable and thus are hard to measure, behaviorist believed that these were not worth studying. However, as Gestalt psychology was introduced to the US by European immigrants, the dominance of the behaviorist approach began to declined. Questions related to perception, judgment, impression formation, and attitude change began to attract more researchers. In the 1950s, the development of new methodological tools ignited the [[Cognitive revolution|Cognitive Revolution]]. In 1984, [[Susan Fiske]] and [[Shelley E. Taylor]] published the first social cognition book, ''Social Cognition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Cognition|last=Fiske|first=Susan T.|last2=Taylor|first2=Shelley E.|publisher=Mcgraw-Hill Book Company|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early theories of social cognition ===
==== Naïve scientist ====
First proposed by [[Fritz Heider]] in 1958, the Naïve scientist model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The psychology of interpersonal relations|last=Heider|first=Fritz|publisher=Wiley|year=1958|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of cognition conceptualizes individuals as actors with limited information that want to derive an accurate understanding of the world. Much of the work done within this model focused on examining how people perceive and explain why others behave the way they do. This work served as the basis for the development of modern theories of [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution,]] advanced independently by [[Harold Kelley]] and [[Bernard Weiner]]. Kelley's [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] theory included the interaction between three variables: consistency, consensus, and distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelley|first=Harold|date=1973|title=The processes of causal attribution|url=|journal=American Psychologist|volume=28|issue=2|pages=107–128|doi=10.1037/h0034225}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interaction was summarized in Kelley's [[Covariation model]], also known as Kelley's cube. Consistency refers to whether the person exhibit the behavior across time. The more the person exhibits the behavior across time, the more representative this behavior is of the person. Consensus refers to whether other individuals exhibits the same behavior when presented in the same situation. If many individuals exhibit the same behavior, then the behavior is less informativeness of the person. Distinctiveness refers to whether the person exhibits similar behavior in other situations. The more the person exhibits the behavior in other situation, the less the behavior is representative of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0001-8791(84)90069-1|title=Attribution theory and unemployment: Kelley's covariation model, self-esteem, and locus of control|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=24|pages=94–109|year=1984|last1=Hesketh|first1=Beryl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive miser ====
The [[Cognitive miser|cognitive miser model]] argues that, when individuals are attempting to understand the world, they tend to prefer methods that allow them to reduce the amount of cognitive work required to process information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|date=1973|title=Availability: A Heuristic for Judging Frequency and Probability|url=|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=5|issue=2|pages=207–232|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(73)90033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This preference for efficiency leads to the development of biases and heuristics. In the past, political psychologists have identified a wide range of biases and heuristics&amp;mdash;such as partisan heuristics and the Black utility heuristic&amp;mdash;that people use to make political decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/the-changing-outlook-for-black-voters/403975/| title=Can the Democratic Party Retain Its Hold on Black Voters?| website=The Atlantic| first=Theodore R.| last=Johnson| date=7 September 2015| access-date=3 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Motivated reasoning ====
[[Motivated reasoning]] is a cognitive phenomena that occurs when an individual changes a peripheral attitude that is inconsistent with a more central element of the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kunda|first=Ziva|date=1990|title=The Case for Motivated Reasoning|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=108|issue=3|pages=480–498|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.108.3.480|pmid=2270237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these cognitive biases is to maintain a positive sense of self-esteem. In the past, they have been referred to as cognitive adaptions and positive illusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.38.11.1161|title = Adjustment to threatening events: A theory of cognitive adaptation|journal = American Psychologist|volume = 38|issue = 11|pages = 1161–1173|year = 1983|last1 = Taylor|first1 = Shelley E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Shelley E.|last2=Brown|first2=Jonathon D.|date=1988|title=Illusion and well-being: perspective on mental health|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=103|issue=2|pages=193–210|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.103.2.193|pmid=3283814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated reasoning has been extensively studied in political psychology. One of the most significant contributions of this area of research is the identification of cases in which voters adopt their preferred candidates' or party' policy positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tesler|first=Michael|date=2015|title=Priming Predispositions and Changing Policy Positions: An Account of When Mass Opinion is Primed or Changed|url=|journal=American Journal of Political Science|publisher=4|volume=59|issue=4|pages=806–824|doi=10.1111/ajps.12157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nyhan|first=Brendan|date=2010|title=When Correction Fail: The Persistence of Political Misperceptions|url=|journal=Political Behavior|volume=32|issue=2|pages=303–330|doi=10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenz|first=Gabriel|date=2009|title=Learning and Opinion Change, not Priming: Reconsidering the Priming Hypothesis|url=|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=53|issue=4|pages=821–837|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00403.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Study of public opinion ===
In political science, the study of political cognition was facilitated by the emergence of survey research and a growing interest in understanding how individual make voting decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology|last=Huddy|first=Leonie|last2=Sears|first2=David O.|last3=Levy|first3=Jack S.|publisher=Oxford|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, however, the explosion of commercial polling agencies facilitated the collection of data at the individual level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The American Voter|last=Cambell|first=Angus|last2=Converse|first2=Philip E.|last3=Miller|first3=Warren E.|last4=Stokes|first4=Donald E.|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of this new type of data increased an interest in understanding what individuals know about politics, what attitudes individual have towards political objects, and how individuals make political decisions. In 1940, [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], [[Bernard Berelson]], and [[Hazel Gaudet-Erskine|Hazel Gaudet]] carried out one of the earliest studies examining how individual-level factors influence political decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign|last=Lazarsfeld|first=Paul F.|last2=Berelson|first2=Bernard|last3=Gaudet|first3=Hazel|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1944|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study took place in Erie County, Ohio. [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Lazarsfeld]], [[Bernard Berelson|Berelson]], and [[Hazel Gaudet-Erskine|Gaudet]] were interested in identifying what sources of information influence an individual's political attitudes during an electoral campaign. They found that, among those who were less interested in politics, had not decided who to support, or change their voting intentions during the campaign, personal influences—such as the opinion of a friend or a family member—played a more significant role than the media. In 1948, by [[Bernard Berelson]], [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Paul F. Lazarsfeld]], and William N. McPhee carried out a similar study in Elmira, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voting: A Study of Opinion Formation in a Presidential Campaign|last=Berelson|first=Bernard R.|last2=Lazarsfeld|first2=Paul F.|last3=McPhee|first3=William|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1954|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Erie County and the Elmira studies had been significantly influential to the study of American public opinion. Their findings have been replicated repeatedly and still explain the ways people develop political attitudes today. The biggest influence of these studies, however, was their methodological approach. These two studies were the first studies that followed an individual's political attitudes and voting intentions throughout a campaign with an interview-reinterview approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1944, the [[NORC at the University of Chicago|National Opinion Research Center (NOR)]] at the [[University of Chicago]] was the first organization ever to collect panel data at a national level in the United States. In the elections of 1944 and 1948, the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan performed similar panel-data studies at the national level. These studies were characterized by unstructured questions that allowed participants to express what they knew about politics, as well as what attitudes they had towards political actors and policies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Major theories of voting behavior (1950s–1980s) ==

===The rational voter===
In his 1957 book, ''[[An Economic Theory of Democracy]]'', [[Anthony Downs]] argues that individuals are rational voters—i.e., they decide who to support by calculating which candidate will maximize the benefits they receive from the government, while minimizing the costs.&lt;ref name="Downs"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Economic Theory of Democracy|last=Downs|first=Anthony|publisher=Harper|year=1957|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rational calculation is performed by taking into consideration the individual's interest, what the party in office has done in the past, and what the party in office and the party out of office could do in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/257897|title=An Economic Theory of Political Action in a Democracy|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=65|issue=2|pages=135–150|year=1957|last1=Downs|first1=Anthony}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|138}}

Downs defines political parties as coalitions of political elites, whose primary goal is to be elected to office. Because they know voters behave rationally, parties adopt the policy positions of most voters to maximize their chances of being elected into office. The interaction between the rational behavior of voters and the rational behavior of the political elite facilitates the development of a two-party system when voters are normally distributed along the liberal-conservative spectrum. The reason for this is that each party will try to maximize the number of voters it can appeal to while still maintaining significant distinctions from the other party. This results in a party heuristic: voters start to consistently support the party that is closest to their beliefs along this liberal-conservative lines.&lt;ref name="Downs"/&gt;

Since its publication, the theory of rational voter has encountered numerous empirical challenges, as research suggests that the average voter is not equipped with the necessary information to make rational decisions as defined by Downs. Specifically, most American voters are unable to think in ideological terms—i.e., to articulate their political positions using coherent belief systems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Drawing from social cognition theories, some scholars have argued voters might be still able to make rational decisions even if they are incapable of putting their perceptions, beliefs, and rationales into the formal language of political elites. Specifically, these critics believe that, instead of expecting the average voter to present high levels of political sophistication, political scientists should take into account individual-level variations of information acquisition and processing. They propose that partisan biases motivate individuals to seek out and reject particular sets of information that then lead to candidate evaluations, and then voting. Thus, these critics advance a theory of rational voter that incorporates both cognitive processes and economic utility calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Michael J.|date=1969|title=Rational Political Man: A Synthesis of Economic and Social-Psychological Perspectives|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=63|issue=4|pages=1106–1119|doi=10.1017/S0003055400263223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Party attachment ===
In 1960, [[Angus Campbell (psychologist)|Angus Campbell]], [[Philip Converse|Philip E. Converse]], [[Warren E. Miller]], and [[Donald E. Stokes]] published ''[[The American Voter]].'' Unlike most prior work, ''The American Voter'' was the first book to systematically analyze quantitative data at the national level from three presidential elections ([[1948 United States presidential election|Truman-Dewey in 1948]], [[1952 United States presidential election|Eisenhower-Stevenson in 1952]], and [[1956 United States presidential election|Eisenhower-Stevenson in 1956]]). This data was collected by the Survey Research Center of the University of Michigan. The theoretical framework derived from these studies is thus known as [[Michigan model]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''The American Voter'' is also one of the first works to ever look for observable implications of the rational choice theory of voting behavior—a body of work that claims voters are aware of political events, have well-developed political attitudes, and thus are able to aligned their votes with the candidate that is closest to their political dispositions. Lastly, this book was also one of the first works to incorporate a social psychological perspective to the study of politics.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Taken as a system, these [attitudinal] variables were seen to constitute a field of forces operating on the individual as he deliberates over his vote decision.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{rp|16}} &lt;/blockquote&gt;
As described by the quote above, the authors of this seminal work that a Lewinian view of the political world. They conceptualize attitudes towards political objects as field forces that led an individual to decide who to support in an election. According to Campbell and colleagues, the most significant of these forces is partisan identification, which the authors defined as a psychological attachment to a party. These psychological attachments are developed early in life and remain stable throughout adulthood. Today, partisan identification is still the strongest and most reliable predictor of vote choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 1963175|title = Party Identification, Realignment, and Party Voting: Back to the Basics|journal = The American Political Science Review|volume = 85|issue = 2|pages = 557–568|last1 = Miller|first1 = Warren E.|year = 1991|doi = 10.2307/1963175|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/05b22bf747a0fb227e4b509e15033c2e7a80211e}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.5070/P20W2R|title = The Myth of the Independent Voter, California Style|journal = California Journal of Politics and Policy|volume = 3|pages = 1–20|year = 2011|last1 = Lascher|first1 = Edward L.|last2 = Korey|first2 = John L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2669291|title = Partisanship and Voting Behavior, 1952-1996|journal = American Journal of Political Science|volume = 44|issue = 1|pages = 35–50|last1 = Bartels|first1 = Larry M.|year = 2000|doi = 10.2307/2669291|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ee6879d1d4f0c3683c5c878f46b8b60783a5883a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.electstud.2015.11.001|title = The rise of negative partisanship and the nationalization of U.S. Elections in the 21st century|journal = Electoral Studies|volume = 41|pages = 12–22|year = 2016|last1 = Abramowitz|first1 = Alan I.|last2 = Webster|first2 = Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Campbell and colleagues, these partisan attachments function as lenses that paint the way people perceive political information about issues and political actors. Specifically, voters accept and endorse information that is consistent with their partisan beliefs, and reject information that is inconsistent with their partisan views. Additionally, since most voters do not have the time to acquire and process all political information available, they use these partisan attachments as heuristics, or shortcuts, when deciding who to support.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Political information and voter sophistication ===

==== Ideology ====
In his widely known book chapter, "The Nature of Belief Systems", [[Philip Converse|Philip E. Converse]] examines the nature of abstract political thought among American voters. Converse defined a belief system as a set of idea-elements that were interconnected by logical, psychological, or social constraints. These belief systems could vary in terms of how central certain idea-elements are to the belief system relative to other idea-elements. The centrality of each idea-element influences whether an individual changes her belief based on external changes in the political world. Idea-elements that are peripheral to an individual's belief system are more likely to change than idea-elements that are central to an individual's belief system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/08913810608443650|title = The nature of belief systems in mass publics (1964)|journal = Critical Review|volume = 18|issue = 1–3|pages = 1–74|year = 2006|last1 = Converse|first1 = Philip E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To perform this study, Converse relied on the analysis of open-ended questions. He specifically examines two things. First, he examines what types of political information is associated with what type of political attitudes. Second, he examines whether voters are able to provide an abstract reason to explain this association by referring to the liberal-conservative spectrum. He found that most voters do not think in coherent ideological terms. He divided voters into five types based on their ideological sophistication: Ideologues, Near Ideologues, Group Interest, Nature of the Times, and No issue content. About less than 10% of the voters are considered ideologues or near ideologues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Converse's findings provided further evidence against the theory of rational voting, as voters seem not to be aware of political events, seem to lack well-developed political attitudes, and thus might be unequipped to make rational and informed decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/08/30/the-unpolitical-animal| title=The Unpolitical Animal| website=The New Yorker| access-date=30 December 2019| date=30 August 2004| first=Louis| last=Menand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Political attitudes ====
 In 1992, political scientist [[John Zaller]] published his book, ''[[The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion]].'' In this work, the author examines the processes by which people develop and report their political opinions. According to Zaller, the study of political opinion must be understood through the lens of political awareness and political values, which is summarized in his Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) model. This model contends that individuals receive political information, decide what to accept and store in memory based on their political values, and when asked to express their opinions about a topic they use a sample of whatever relevant information is accessible in memory to construct their opinions on the spot.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion|last=Zaller|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since most people do not have a direct experience with the political world, they often rely on the political elite&amp;mdash;which includes both politicians and the media&amp;mdash;to acquire political information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markus|first=Gregory B.|date=1994|title=[No title found]|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=58|issue=4|pages=633|doi=10.1086/269451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaller argues that voters vary greatly in terms of political awareness either because of a lack of interest in politics or because of a lack of time to pay attention. Consequently, the average voter tends to score low on measures of political knowledge. Zaller observes that this lack of political information is associated with the high level of attitude instability that is exhibited among voters. According to Zaller, this instability is a sign of voters constructing their opinion statements on the spot based on relevant information that happens to be available in memory, rather than the complete in-existence of an attitude (as suggested by Converse) or measurement error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.niskanencenter.org/how-to-change-public-opinion/| title=How to Change Public Opinion| access-date=30 December 2019|website=Niskanen Center|first=Jerry|last=Taylor| date=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

When voters receive information from the political elite, they almost never receive a complete and neutral account of facts. They receive an oversimplified version of the relevant information that often comes with a political frame, which interacts with the voter's predispositions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If the information is consistent with the voter's prior beliefs, then the information is accepted and stored in memory. If the information is inconsistent with the voter's prior beliefs, then the information is not accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/events/Zaller_paper.pdf| title=What ''Nature'' and Origins'' Leaves Out| first=John| last=Zaller| journal=Critical Review| volume=24| issue=4| pages=569–642|year=2012|doi=10.1080/08913811.2012.807648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In political science, Zaller's work has been instrumental in the examination of two major types of evaluations: 1) on-line evaluations; and 2) memory-based evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://electionstudies.org/papers-documents/conference-papers/the-psychology-of-voting-and-election-campaigns/the-psychology-of-voting-and-election-campaigns-about-the-psychology-of-voting/|title=The Psychology of Voting and Election Campaigns: About the Psychology of Voting|website=ANES {{!}} American National Election Studies|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/10584609.2013.828143|title = How Quickly We Forget: The Duration of Persuasion Effects from Mass Communication|journal = Political Communication|volume = 30|issue = 4|pages = 521–547|year = 2013|last1 = Hill|first1 = Seth J.|last2 = Lo|first2 = James|last3 = Vavreck|first3 = Lynn|last4 = Zaller|first4 = John|url = https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6g9321sd}}&lt;/ref&gt; On-line evaluation model asserts that individuals update their evaluations of political objects every time they acquire new information. The memory-based evaluation model asserts that individuals construct their evaluations on the spot based on information available in the working memory. Because most voters fail to recall the content of information they are exposed to during a campaign, many political scientists believed that voters rely on memory-based processes to make political judgments.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; On the contrary, other scholars believed that voters do update their evaluations of political objects as they acquire new information, but these updates take the form of affective evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1057/9781403983114_2| chapter=First Steps Toward a Dual-Process Accessibility Model of Political Beliefs, Attitudes, and Behavior| title=Feeling Politics| pages=11–30| year=2006| last1=Lodge| first1=Milton| last2=Taber| first2=Charles| last3=Weber| first3=Christopher| isbn=978-1-349-53320-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 2082427|title = The Responsive Voter: Campaign Information and the Dynamics of Candidate Evaluation|journal = The American Political Science Review|volume = 89|issue = 2|pages = 309–326|last1 = Lodge|first1 = Milton|last2 = Steenbergen|first2 = Marco R.|last3 = Brau|first3 = Shawn|year = 1995|doi = 10.2307/2082427|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/bef008119afb1582515912c3f3c379b6a2c56a02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, when voters receive political information—either from a political campaign or from the media—the voter processes that information and turns it into an affective evaluation that is then stored in memory. These stored affective evaluations are then used to make political decisions along with memory-based information. This process is known as the dual processing model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199545636.003.0023|year=2011|last1=Taber|first1=Charles S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Priming and agenda setting ===
[[Priming (psychology)|Priming]] is a cognitive process that occurs when a stimulus changes the attitudinal or behavioral response of an individual. This process is facilitated by the activation of information related to the stimulus in the working memory without the individual's awareness. In the study of politics, priming effects have been primarily studied with relation to the media and political campaigns. In 1987, [[Shanto Iyengar]] and [[Donald Kinder]] published ''News That Matters: Televised and American Opinion''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=News That Matters: Television and American Opinion|last=Iyengar|first=Shanto|last2=Kinder|first2=Donald|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work reported the results of a series experiments designed to assess the role of the media on political attitudes. They found that the primarily role of the media is to set the agenda for political evaluations. According to the authors, the media is able to achieve this by priming—or in this case, by making more salient—certain political issues. These salient issues are then used to make political evaluations. Additional work has illustrated that priming only occurs among topics in which the voter has already well-established predispositions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tesler|first=Michael|date=2015|title=Priming Predispositions and Changing Policy Positions: An Account of When Opinion is Primed or Changed|url=|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=59|issue=4|pages=806–824|doi=10.1111/ajps.12157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Persuasion ===
Most research about political persuasion has taken place within the context of campaign effect. Early work finds that campaigns that use various forms of personal contact (e.g., canvassing and telephone calls) to deliver information are more effective than campaigns that use non-personal contact (e.g., mailing information) at mobilizing voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 1951603|title = Experimental Propaganda Techniques and Voting Behavior|journal = The American Political Science Review|volume = 50|issue = 1|pages = 154–165|last1 = Eldersveld|first1 = Samuel J.|year = 1956|doi = 10.2307/1951603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary research suggests that whenever persuasion—defined as an attitude change—is achieved, its effects are relatively small and fade away rapidly.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, well-developed political predisposition are not easily persuadable, while less developed attitudes move around fairly easily.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Social identities and inter-group relations ==

=== Linked fate: black utility heuristic ===
In his 1994 book, ''Behind the Mule: Race and Class in African-American Politics,'' Michael Dawson argues African American voters use evaluations of their group-level interests as short-cuts to determine the policy positions, vote choice, and political engagement that would safeguard their individual-level interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Behind the Mule: Race and Class in African-American Politics.|last=Dawson|first=Michael|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Dawson, this political heuristic was developed as a consequence of the historical oppression of African Americans, which facilitated the development of the belief that individual interest was linked to the racial group interest among African Americans. Consequently, this black utility heuristic is known as linked fate. Dawson argues that racial issues override class-based differences which results in the political homogeneity of African Americans. Additional work suggests that other groups—including Whites, Asian Americans, Latinxs, and women—also exhibit linked fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 3792120|title = Doubly Bound: The Impact of Gender and Race on the Politics of Black Women|journal = Political Psychology|volume = 19|issue = 1|pages = 169–184|last1 = Gay|first1 = Claudine|last2 = Tate|first2 = Katherine|year = 1998|doi = 10.1111/0162-895X.00098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simien|first=Evelyn M.|date=2005|title=Race, Gender, and Linked Fate|url=|journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=35|issue=5|pages=529–550|doi=10.1177/0021934704265899}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanchez|first=Gabriel R.|last2=Masuoka|first2=Natalie|date=2010|title=Brown-Utility Heuristic?

Other researchers have advocated for the revision of the current linked fate measure, as it seems to be inconsistently associated with group identification and with political engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gay|first=Claudine|last2=Hochschild|first2=Jennifer|last3=White|first3=Ariel|date=2016|title=Americans' Belief in Linked Fate: Does the Measure Capture the Concept?|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:33973832|journal=Journal of Race, Ethnicity, and Politics|volume=1|issue=1|pages=117–144|via=|doi=10.1017/rep.2015.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
